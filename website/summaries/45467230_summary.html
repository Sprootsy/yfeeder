  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article, written as if from the perspective of October 2025, discusses the perilous state of credit markets. It notes that for the past year, markets have been relatively calm, but underlying risks have continued to build. A significant concern is the enormous amount of corporate debt, which has grown substantially over the past decade, particularly in the form of leveraged loans and private credit. These types of debt often lack the safeguards of traditional bonds, such as covenants. The proliferation of these riskier assets has been fueled by low interest rates in the past and a search for yield by investors.

    The piece points out that while debt was manageable when rates were low, the situation has changed dramatically as central banks have raised rates to combat inflation. This has led to higher debt-servicing costs for companies, squeezing their profit margins, especially for those with weaker balance sheets. Refinancing debt has also become more expensive and difficult, increasing the risk of defaults.

    Furthermore, the article highlights the concentration of risk within non-bank financial institutions, such as private-credit firms, which are less regulated than traditional banks. The lack of transparency in these markets and the potential for liquidity problems raise concerns about systemic risk. The author also mentions the potential impact on the broader economy, as tighter credit conditions could lead to reduced investment and slower growth. The situation is further complicated by geopolitical tensions and uncertainties, which could trigger sudden market shocks.

    The article suggests that while a full-blown financial crisis is not inevitable, the conditions are ripe for a significant correction in credit markets. Prudent investors are advised to exercise caution and carefully assess their exposure to risky assets.
