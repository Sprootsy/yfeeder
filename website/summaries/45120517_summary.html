    <h2>Where&#39;s the shovelware? Why AI coding claims don&#39;t add up</h2>

     This article discusses the current state of AI-assisted coding and why it hasn't led to a deluge of low-quality software (shovelware) as some predicted. The author argues that while AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT can generate code snippets and even entire applications, several factors prevent the creation of widespread shovelware.

   <p>
     One key reason is that coding is more than just writing code. It involves understanding complex systems, debugging, testing, and maintaining code over time. AI can assist with code generation, but it often struggles with the higher-level reasoning and problem-solving skills required for software development. The author emphasizes the importance of "thinking in systems," which involves considering the broader context of the code and its interactions with other components. AI tools can't easily replicate this holistic understanding.

     Another barrier to AI-generated shovelware is the need for human oversight and refinement. AI-generated code may contain errors, inefficiencies, or security vulnerabilities that require human developers to identify and fix. Furthermore, AI struggles to adapt to unique project requirements or complex business logic. Developers still need to understand the underlying code and make necessary modifications to ensure it meets the specific needs of the application. This need for human intervention limits the ability of AI to produce fully automated, high-quality software.

     The article also highlights the challenge of maintaining and updating AI-generated code. Software projects often require ongoing maintenance, bug fixes, and feature enhancements. AI tools may struggle to understand the existing codebase and make changes without introducing new problems. Human developers are needed to ensure the long-term viability and stability of the software.

     The author also touches upon the potential for AI to be used for malicious purposes, such as generating malware or creating phishing campaigns. However, the article argues that these threats are not unique to AI and can be addressed through existing security measures and ethical guidelines.
   </p>
   <p>
     Ultimately, the article concludes that AI is a valuable tool for assisting developers, but it is not a replacement for human expertise. AI can automate certain tasks, improve efficiency, and reduce the amount of boilerplate code, but it cannot fully replicate the complex problem-solving and critical-thinking skills required for successful software development. The author believes that AI will continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, but human developers will remain essential for building and maintaining high-quality software.
