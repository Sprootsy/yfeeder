  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    GAO-25-107196, a report by the Government Accountability Office, examines the
    federal government's efforts to address marine debris. Marine debris, defined
    as persistent solid waste in the marine environment, poses significant threats
    to marine ecosystems, wildlife, and human health, and it can also have economic
    consequences. The report assesses the roles and responsibilities of federal
    agencies, the strategies they employ, and the challenges they face in
    combating this pervasive problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    The report identifies the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
    (NOAA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as key federal agencies
    involved in addressing marine debris. NOAA primarily focuses on research,
    prevention, and removal efforts, while the EPA addresses land-based sources of
    marine debris through regulatory and voluntary programs. The report also
    acknowledges the contributions of other federal agencies, such as the Coast
    Guard, in addressing specific aspects of the issue.
  </p>
  <p>
    GAO's analysis highlights the importance of interagency coordination in
    tackling marine debris effectively. The report acknowledges the existence of
    the Interagency Marine Debris Coordinating Committee (IMDCC), which aims to
    enhance collaboration among federal agencies. However, the report suggests
    that opportunities exist to improve coordination and ensure that efforts are
    aligned and complementary.
  </p>
  <p>
    The report also examines the challenges associated with measuring the
    effectiveness of marine debris programs. Quantifying the impacts of these
    programs is difficult due to the complex nature of the problem and the lack of
    standardized metrics. The report emphasizes the need for improved data
    collection and analysis to better assess the effectiveness of different
    strategies and inform future decision-making.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, the report addresses the issue of international cooperation in
    addressing marine debris, since it is a global problem that requires
    international solutions. The report acknowledges the United States' engagement
    in international forums and initiatives aimed at reducing marine debris.
    However, the report suggests that there are opportunities to strengthen
    international partnerships and promote more effective global action.
  </p>
  <p>
    In conclusion, GAO-25-107196 provides a comprehensive overview of the federal
    government's efforts to address marine debris. The report highlights the roles
    of key federal agencies, the importance of interagency coordination, the
    challenges of measuring program effectiveness, and the need for international
    cooperation. The findings and recommendations presented in the report aim to
    inform policymakers and stakeholders and to enhance the effectiveness of
    efforts to combat marine debris and protect marine environments.
