  <p>The article on Codeberg describes "tek," a minimalistic, stack-based, and extensible programming language designed for learning and experimentation. It emphasizes simplicity and ease of implementation as core principles. Tek's syntax is Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), where operators follow their operands. The language features a small set of built-in functions, including stack manipulation (dup, swap, drop), basic arithmetic (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (=, &lt;, &gt;), logical operators (not, and, or), and I/O functions (print, read).

The language is stack-based, meaning that data is manipulated on a stack rather than through named variables. This simplifies the interpreter's design and encourages a different style of programming. Extensibility is achieved through the ability to define new functions using existing ones. These user-defined functions become part of the language's vocabulary.

The article provides a comprehensive overview of tek, including its design philosophy, syntax, core functions, and implementation details. It showcases examples of how to write basic programs in tek, such as calculating Fibonacci numbers or implementing simple control flow structures. The author encourages readers to implement their own tek interpreters to gain a deeper understanding of programming language design.

The document also covers more advanced topics such as memory management (manual memory allocation using `alloc` and `free`), string manipulation (using character arrays and related functions), and the concept of "words" (user-defined functions). The implementation details suggest a focus on portability and simplicity, often using standard C for the interpreter.

The text also illustrates how one could implement more complex features, such as conditionals (if/else constructs), loops (while loops), and recursion, all within the constraints of the stack-based architecture. The examples showcase techniques for manipulating the stack to achieve control flow and data management.

Overall, the article presents tek as a valuable tool for learning about programming language design and implementation, particularly for those interested in stack-based languages and minimalistic interpreters. It offers a clear and concise introduction to the language's features and provides practical examples to help readers get started with their own tek implementations.</p>
