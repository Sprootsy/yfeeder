 <h3>Summary:</h3>
 <p>Dominion Voting Systems and Newsmax have reached a settlement in Dominion's defamation lawsuit against the right-wing media outlet. The lawsuit stemmed from Newsmax's repeated airing of false claims that Dominion's voting machines were used to rig the 2020 presidential election in favor of Joe Biden. These claims were amplified by figures associated with Donald Trump and spread widely across conservative media. While the terms of the settlement are confidential, it resolves a significant legal challenge for Newsmax, which, like other conservative media outlets, faced scrutiny for promoting baseless conspiracy theories about the election. Dominion has pursued similar lawsuits against other organizations and individuals who spread misinformation about the company. Newsmax has begun to walk back some of its previous claims about Dominion, acknowledging that there was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election. This settlement follows a similar agreement between Dominion and Fox News, though that settlement occurred after a jury had already been selected for trial. The case against Newsmax highlights the legal repercussions for media organizations that knowingly or recklessly disseminate false information that damages a company's reputation. The agreement with Newsmax marks another step in Dominion's effort to hold those who spread disinformation accountable.</p>
