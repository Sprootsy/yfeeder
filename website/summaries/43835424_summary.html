        <h1>Everything we announced at our first LlamaCon</h1>
        <p>
<div>
<p>Meta's blog post discusses several updates and announcements related to the Llama family of large language models, revealed at LlamaCon. The core announcement revolves around the next generation of Llama models, Llama 3, which is currently being trained. While specific details about Llama 3's architecture and capabilities are not provided, the blog post emphasizes that it will represent a significant leap forward compared to Llama 2. The company promises new capabilities, including improved reasoning and broader language support. Llama 3 models are expected to become available in the coming months.</p>

<p>The post also highlights improvements to the existing Llama 2 model family. This includes making Llama 2 available on new platforms like Snowflake, AWS Sagemaker Jumpstart, Databricks, and Google Cloud Vertex AI Model Garden. These integrations aim to make Llama 2 more accessible to developers and researchers across various cloud environments. Additionally, Meta notes the ongoing community support for Llama 2 and its use in a wide range of applications.</p>

<p>Another key announcement concerns the expansion of the Llama Guard safety tool. Llama Guard is designed to help developers build safer applications using language models. Meta announced Llama Guard 2, the next generation of this safety tool. Llama Guard 2 boasts improved performance in filtering unsafe content, expanded language coverage, and enhanced modularity. The update allows for more customization and better alignment with specific use cases. The release of Llama Guard 2 demonstrates Meta's commitment to responsible AI development and the creation of safer AI-powered applications.</p>

<p>The blog post introduces Code Shield, a new tool aimed at improving code generation safety. It focuses on mitigating risks associated with code generated by LLMs, such as security vulnerabilities and biases. Code Shield acts as a safety layer to analyze and filter potentially harmful code, adding an extra layer of protection for developers using LLMs for code generation purposes. This addresses a specific concern in the rapidly growing field of AI-assisted coding.</p>

<p>The blog also details the AudioSeal project. AudioSeal is a tool for detecting AI-generated audio. This addresses the increasing concerns about the potential misuse of AI in generating realistic audio content, including deepfakes and misinformation. The system uses an imperceptible watermark embedded in the audio, which allows for verifying the authenticity of audio files, and combating the spread of synthetic audio. This project highlights Meta's broader efforts to combat the spread of AI-generated misinformation.</p>

<p>Finally, Meta outlines its ongoing commitment to open innovation and collaboration within the AI community. It emphasizes the importance of open-source models and tools in driving progress and ensuring responsible AI development. The company encourages developers and researchers to leverage the Llama family of models and associated tools, contribute to the community, and help shape the future of AI.</p>
