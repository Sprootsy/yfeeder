  <p>This article is a guide on how to program an ESP32 microcontroller using Termux, an Android terminal emulator, thereby enabling development without relying on a traditional desktop or laptop environment. It details the process of setting up the necessary toolchain, including the ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework), Python, and other dependencies, directly within Termux. The author emphasizes the benefits of this approach, such as portability and the ability to develop on the go using only a smartphone or tablet. The guide walks through the installation of prerequisite packages like `tsu`, `ncurses-utils`, `libusb`, `python`, `pip`, and `rsync`. It also explains how to install the ESP-IDF, configuring it by setting the `IDF_PATH` environment variable. The article covers the steps to connect the ESP32 to the Android device using a USB OTG (On-The-Go) adapter and uses `lsusb` to confirm the device is recognized. It also describes how to use the `esptool.py` utility for flashing the compiled firmware onto the ESP32. The author provides specific commands and troubleshooting tips to address potential issues, such as permission errors. By following the outlined steps, the reader can compile, flash, and monitor ESP32 projects directly from their Android device, making embedded systems development more accessible and convenient.</p>
