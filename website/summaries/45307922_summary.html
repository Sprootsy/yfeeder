    <h2>Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers</h2>
    <div>
 <div>
  <p>On September 25, 2025, the President issued a proclamation restricting the entry of certain nonimmigrant workers into the United States. The proclamation states that the entry of any nonimmigrant worker described in section 1(a) of the proclamation would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.</p>
  
  <p>Section 1(a) of the proclamation applies to any foreign national seeking entry as a nonimmigrant under the H-1B, H-2B, L-1, or J-1 visa programs, and any accompanying spouse or children. There are some exceptions mentioned in the proclamation, but they are not specified in the provided text.</p>
  
  <p>The proclamation explains that the restrictions are necessary because the high unemployment rates resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak continue to adversely affect U.S. workers. The President found that certain nonimmigrant visa programs, which allow U.S. employers to hire foreign workers, present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the employment of American workers.</p>
  
  <p>The restrictions imposed by the proclamation are set to expire on December 31, 2025, and may be continued as necessary. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of State, is authorized to establish procedures to implement the proclamation. Additionally, the Secretary of State is directed to prioritize the processing of visa applications for individuals critical to the Nationâ€™s response to the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as those involved in supporting the economic recovery.</p>
  
  <p>In summary, the proclamation temporarily restricts the entry of certain nonimmigrant workers in the H-1B, H-2B, L-1, and J-1 visa categories to protect American jobs during the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
