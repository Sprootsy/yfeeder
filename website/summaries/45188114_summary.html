  <p>The article "Why I Love PHP and JavaScript" by Joel Dare celebrates the author's fondness for these two widely-used web development languages, PHP and JavaScript. The author expresses a contrarian view, noting that while both languages are often criticized, they have been instrumental in the evolution of the web and continue to be powerful tools for building dynamic web applications.</p>
  <p>The author's appreciation for PHP stems from its history as a simple, accessible language that enabled many people to start building web applications. He acknowledges its quirks and inconsistencies but emphasizes its practicality and the large community that supports it. The author reflects on PHP's straightforward approach to web development, where embedding PHP code directly into HTML files made it easy for beginners to grasp the basics of server-side programming. He contrasts this simplicity with the perceived complexity of other languages, highlighting PHP's low barrier to entry as a key factor in its widespread adoption.</p>
  <p>Regarding JavaScript, the author admires its ubiquity in web browsers and its ability to create interactive and engaging user experiences. He acknowledges the challenges of JavaScript development, such as dealing with different browser implementations and the evolving landscape of frameworks and libraries. However, he values the language's flexibility and its capacity to enhance web pages with dynamic content, animations, and asynchronous communication. The author also touches on the evolution of JavaScript, from its early days as a scripting language for simple browser interactions to its current role as a powerful language for building complex web applications and even server-side applications with Node.js.</p>
  <p>The article is a defense of PHP and JavaScript, arguing that their flaws are outweighed by their benefits and their continued relevance in the modern web development landscape. The author encourages developers to appreciate the strengths of these languages and to use them effectively to build innovative web applications. He argues against blindly following the latest trends and frameworks, instead advocating for a pragmatic approach to web development that leverages the power and simplicity of PHP and JavaScript.</p>
