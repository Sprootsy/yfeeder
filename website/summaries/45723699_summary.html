    <div>
<div>
  <p>The article describes the MCP-Scanner, a tool developed by Cisco AI Defense for scanning and analyzing container images and file systems for security vulnerabilities. It focuses on identifying malicious code patterns (MCPs) to detect potential threats that traditional vulnerability scanners might miss. The MCP-Scanner is designed to be extensible, allowing users to add custom MCP definitions and integrate it into their existing security workflows. It supports various scanning modes, including scanning local directories, container images from local storage or registries, and remote file systems via SSH. The tool provides detailed reports on detected MCPs, including their location, description, and severity, facilitating investigation and remediation. It supports different output formats, like JSON, and can be integrated with other tools and platforms.</p>
