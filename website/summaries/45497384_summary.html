    <h2>Microsoft is plugging more holes that let you use Windows 11 without MS account</h2>

<p>The Verge article discusses a workaround to bypass the requirement for a Microsoft account during the initial setup of Windows 11 Home. Initially, Windows 11 Home edition required users to connect to the internet and sign in with a Microsoft account during setup. This requirement was met with criticism from users who preferred using a local account for privacy or other reasons. The article details how users discovered that disconnecting the internet connection during the setup process, or using a command prompt command to bypass the network check, allowed them to create a local account instead.</p>

<p>The article then reports that Microsoft has implemented changes to make this workaround more difficult, but not impossible, to execute. In newer versions of Windows 11, disconnecting from the internet during the Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE) phase will loop back to the network connection page, preventing the creation of a local account. However, some users have found new, though somewhat cumbersome, methods to still bypass the Microsoft account requirement.</p>

<p>One method involves using the "OOBE\BYPASSNRO" command in the command prompt during the setup process. This command restarts the OOBE and presents an option to say "I don't have internet", which then allows the user to proceed with creating a local account. However, Microsoft may continue to find methods to circumvent these workarounds in future versions of Windows 11, signaling a persistent push towards requiring Microsoft accounts for the full Windows 11 experience.</p>
