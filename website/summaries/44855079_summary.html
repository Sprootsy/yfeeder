<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The Yale Grammatical Diversity Project article "Try and" examines the usage of "try and" followed by a verb, as in "try and do something," as an alternative to the more standard "try to" construction. The article explores the history, regional distribution, and grammatical characteristics of "try and." It notes that while "try to" is generally considered the prescriptive standard, "try and" is a common feature in many dialects of English, particularly in American English. The article dispels the notion that "try and" is simply a mistake or a corruption of "try to," presenting evidence that it functions as a grammatical structure in its own right. </p>

<p>The analysis delves into the origins of "try and," suggesting that it may have arisen from a reanalysis of earlier constructions. It highlights the observation that "try and" often appears with verbs expressing an intention or attempt, and it is often used in informal contexts. The article also points out that "try and" behaves differently from "try to" in certain grammatical environments. For instance, "try and" tends to be more fixed and less easily separated by adverbs or other intervening words compared to "try to."</p>

<p>Furthermore, the article addresses the prescriptive attitudes towards "try and," acknowledging that it is frequently stigmatized in formal writing and academic settings. Despite this, the article emphasizes that its widespread use across diverse populations indicates that it is a legitimate and rule-governed part of English grammar in many varieties. The Yale Grammatical Diversity Project advocates for a descriptive approach, aiming to understand the patterns and functions of "try and" without imposing prescriptive judgments.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the article advocates for a more nuanced understanding of "try and," recognizing it as a valid grammatical feature with its own history, distribution, and characteristics. It encourages linguists and language users to move beyond simplistic notions of correctness and consider the actual usage patterns of different dialects of English.</p>
