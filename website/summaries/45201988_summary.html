    <h2>Rayhunter: IMSI Catchers We Have Found So Far</h2>
    <div>

  <p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) published an article in September 2025 detailing their findings from Project Rayhunter, an investigation into government access to smartphone location data. The project was launched in response to increasing concerns about the ease with which law enforcement and other government agencies were obtaining location information from mobile devices without proper oversight or judicial warrants.</p>
  <p>The EFF's investigation revealed a complex ecosystem of data brokers and location analytics companies that aggregate and sell location data harvested from smartphone apps. These companies collect vast amounts of location information from millions of users, often without their explicit consent or full understanding. This data is then analyzed and sold to various customers, including government agencies.</p>
  <p>A significant finding of Project Rayhunter was the widespread use of "geofence warrants." These warrants allow law enforcement to request location data for all devices within a specific geographic area during a particular time period. The EFF found that these warrants were often used to investigate minor crimes, raising serious concerns about the scope and potential for abuse.</p>
  <p>The EFF also discovered that government agencies were using sophisticated techniques to de-anonymize location data, making it possible to identify individual users despite claims that the data was anonymized. This raised concerns about the privacy of individuals who believed their location data was protected.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the investigation highlighted the lack of transparency and accountability in the location data market. The EFF found that it was difficult to track where location data was coming from, how it was being used, and who was responsible for protecting users' privacy.</p>
  <p>Project Rayhunter led the EFF to advocate for stronger legal protections for location data, including stricter warrant requirements, greater transparency in the location data market, and increased accountability for data brokers and government agencies. The EFF also called on individuals to take steps to protect their own location privacy, such as reviewing app permissions, using privacy-focused apps, and advocating for stronger privacy laws.</p>
