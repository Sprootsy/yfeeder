<p>The article describes AsciiMath, a markup language that allows authors to write mathematical notation using only ASCII characters. This is particularly useful in environments where more complex formatting tools like LaTeX or MathML are not available or practical, such as online forums, email, or simple text editors. AsciiMath aims to provide a human-readable and easily editable way to represent mathematical expressions.</p>

<p>The document outlines the syntax and rules of AsciiMath, covering various mathematical constructs. It details how to represent basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), exponents, subscripts, and superscripts using simple ASCII symbols. For example, multiplication can be represented with an asterisk `*` or a space, and exponents with a caret `^`.</p>

<p>The article explains how to denote fractions using `/`, square roots using `sqrt`, and other roots using `root(n)(expression)`. It also shows how to write summations, products, integrals, and other calculus-related notations using corresponding keywords like `sum`, `prod`, `int`, and `lim`. Greek letters are rendered using their ASCII equivalents (e.g., `alpha`, `beta`, `theta`).</p>

<p>The document covers the representation of matrices and vectors, detailing the use of delimiters like `(` and `)` or `[` and `]` to enclose the elements. It also shows how to use `matrix` and `pmatrix` (for matrices with parentheses) to create matrices, and `vector` and `pmatrix` to create vectors. The `vdots`, `cdots`, and `ddots` commands are used to represent vertical, horizontal, and diagonal dots, respectively, within matrices.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the article provides examples of how to represent set theory notation, including set membership (`in`), set union (`cup`), set intersection (`cap`), and subsets (`subset`, `subseteq`). Logical operators such as `and`, `or`, `not`, and quantifiers like `exists` and `forall` are also covered.</p>

<p>The article gives examples of relational operators like `!=` (not equal), `<=` (less than or equal), `>=` (greater than or equal), and `approx` (approximately equal). It also includes trigonometry functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `cot`, `sec`, `csc`) and hyperbolic functions (`sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`, `coth`, `sech`, `csch`).</p>

<p>The article describes the use of backticks (`) to represent literal text within mathematical expressions, allowing for the inclusion of non-mathematical symbols or words. The overall goal of AsciiMath is to strike a balance between ease of use, readability, and the ability to represent a wide range of mathematical concepts using only plain text.</p>
