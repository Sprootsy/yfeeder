Jane Goodall, the pioneering primatologist and conservationist, has died at the age of 91. The article recounts her extraordinary life and career, focusing on her groundbreaking research on chimpanzees in Tanzania's Gombe Stream National Park, which revolutionized the understanding of primate behavior and challenged conventional scientific wisdom.

Goodall began her research in 1960 with little formal scientific training. She immersed herself in the chimpanzees' habitat, patiently observing their behavior and gradually gaining their trust. Her meticulous observations led to remarkable discoveries that overturned established beliefs. She observed chimpanzees using tools, such as modified twigs to extract termites from mounds, demonstrating that tool use was not exclusive to humans. This finding was so significant that it prompted a redefinition of what it meant to be human. Goodall also documented chimpanzees hunting and eating meat, challenging the notion that they were primarily vegetarian. Furthermore, she witnessed instances of chimpanzee warfare and infanticide, revealing the darker side of their social behavior.

Beyond her scientific contributions, Goodall became a passionate advocate for chimpanzee conservation and animal welfare. She founded the Jane Goodall Institute in 1977, which supports research, conservation, education, and community development programs around the world. She traveled extensively, raising awareness about the threats facing chimpanzees and their habitats, including deforestation, poaching, and the bushmeat trade.
