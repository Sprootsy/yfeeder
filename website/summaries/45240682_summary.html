   <p>This article is a comprehensive guide to writing an operating system kernel from scratch. It details the entire process, starting from the initial boot sequence to implementing essential kernel features like memory management, interrupt handling, and basic drivers.</p>
   <p>The article begins by explaining the boot process of a computer, focusing on the BIOS and the boot sector. It describes how the BIOS loads the boot sector into memory and executes it. The author then walks through the creation of a simple bootloader, written in assembly language, that sets up the basic environment for the kernel to run.</p>
   <p>Next, the article covers setting up the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) to enable protected mode, a crucial step for accessing more memory and enabling advanced CPU features. It explains the structure of the GDT and how to create entries for code and data segments.</p>
   <p>The process of transitioning to protected mode is then discussed, including setting the appropriate control registers and performing a far jump to the kernel's entry point. This transition marks a significant step towards running a more sophisticated operating system.</p>
   <p>With protected mode enabled, the article delves into the implementation of a basic kernel. This involves setting up a stack, clearing the screen, and printing some initial output to verify that the kernel is running correctly. The author provides code examples in C, demonstrating how to interact with the hardware.</p>
   <p>Interrupt handling is another essential topic covered in the article. It explains how to set up the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) to handle hardware interrupts, such as those generated by the keyboard or the timer. The article also demonstrates how to write interrupt handlers to respond to these events.</p>
   <p>The article then discusses how to handle keyboard input using interrupt 16. The author walks the reader through the process of setting up an interrupt handler to read key presses from the keyboard and display them on the screen.</p>
   <p>Memory management is another crucial aspect of operating system development covered in the article. The author describes how to implement a simple memory manager to allocate and deallocate memory within the kernel. This is essential for creating dynamic data structures and managing system resources.</p>
   <p>Following this, the article explains how to implement a simple serial driver to output log messages to the serial port, which is helpful for debugging the kernel. The author also describes the usage of the VGA driver and its importance to display information on the screen.</p>
   <p>The article also addresses the implementation of a basic timer driver using Programmable Interval Timer (PIT). The PIT is used to generate interrupts at a specific frequency, which can be used for tasks such as scheduling.</p>
   <p>Finally, the article concludes by emphasizing the importance of continuous learning and experimentation in operating system development. It encourages readers to explore further topics such as process management, file systems, and networking to expand their knowledge and skills.</p>
