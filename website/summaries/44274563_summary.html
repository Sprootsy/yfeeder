<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Google Cloud reported a service disruption affecting multiple services starting on Tuesday, April 16, 2024, at 14:53 US/Pacific. The root cause was identified as a configuration change to the network, which resulted in widespread packet loss. This packet loss impacted a variety of Google Cloud services, including but not limited to Google Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Cloud Storage, and others relying on the Google network infrastructure. The disruption caused errors, increased latency, and general unavailability for users attempting to access or utilize the affected services. Mitigation efforts were initiated immediately, focusing on rolling back the problematic network configuration change. The initial stages involved identifying the scope and impact of the issue, followed by implementing the rollback procedure. Over the course of several hours, Google engineers worked to revert the changes and restore network performance. The rollback was executed in phases to minimize additional impact. Throughout the incident, Google provided updates via their status dashboard, communicating the ongoing efforts and the expected timeline for full recovery. As the rollback progressed, service availability gradually improved, with some services recovering faster than others. Google continued to monitor the situation closely, verifying the restoration of full functionality across all affected services. By 18:16 US/Pacific, Google reported that the mitigation was complete and that services were returning to normal operation. They indicated they would conduct a thorough post-incident review to prevent similar issues in the future.</p>
