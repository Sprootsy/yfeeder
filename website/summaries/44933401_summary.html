  <p>The Archiveteam project is undertaking a focused effort to archive content from the goo.gl URL shortening service before it is shut down. Google announced the shutdown of goo.gl, with the deadline for existing users to migrate being March 30, 2019. After this date, all links will redirect to Firebase Dynamic Links. The project aims to preserve the content behind these shortened URLs before they potentially become lost or inaccessible due to the redirection or any unforeseen issues. The project utilizes a specialized crawler that expands the shortened URLs and archives the content from the destination websites. The crawler identifies goo.gl shortlinks and uses the "requests" library to follow the redirects. It then employs "ArchiveBot" to submit the final destination URL to the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine for archiving. The project is focused on URLs pointing to web content, and explicitly excludes URLs that lead to files for download. The crawler respects robots.txt rules to avoid archiving content that website owners have disallowed. The Archiveteam emphasizes the importance of this project for preserving web history and preventing link rot. They encourage participation from volunteers with technical skills to assist in running and improving the archiving process.</p>
