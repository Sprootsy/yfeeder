<h3>Summary:</h3>
The article "Reinvent the Wheel" by Endler explores the common advice in software development to avoid reinventing the wheel and argues that sometimes, reinventing existing solutions can be a valuable learning experience and lead to deeper understanding. The author acknowledges the validity of the traditional advice, particularly in professional settings where efficiency and speed are crucial, and where using well-established libraries and frameworks is generally the most practical approach.

However, the article posits that for personal projects, educational purposes, or when facing specific constraints or requirements, reinventing the wheel can be incredibly beneficial. It allows developers to gain a thorough understanding of how things work under the hood, explore alternative approaches, and potentially create solutions that are better tailored to their unique needs. The author emphasizes that blindly adhering to the "don't reinvent the wheel" mantra can hinder learning and innovation.

The author presents several arguments to support the case for occasional reinvention. Firstly, it fosters a deeper understanding of fundamental concepts. By implementing an existing algorithm or data structure from scratch, developers gain insight into its inner workings, complexities, and limitations. Secondly, it provides opportunities to explore alternative solutions. Existing libraries may not always be the best fit for a specific problem, and reinventing the wheel can lead to the discovery of more efficient or elegant approaches. Thirdly, it encourages experimentation and innovation. By stepping outside the boundaries of established solutions, developers can explore new ideas and potentially create novel solutions.

The article also addresses some common criticisms of reinventing the wheel, such as the potential for creating inferior or buggy solutions. The author acknowledges these risks but argues that the learning benefits outweigh the potential drawbacks, especially in non-production environments. It's also mentioned that understanding existing solutions is facilitated by attempting to recreate them. The key point is to not blindly apply code without understanding.

The author concludes by advocating for a balanced approach. While using established libraries and frameworks is often the most practical choice, developers should not be afraid to reinvent the wheel when it serves a clear learning or innovation purpose. The goal is to understand existing solutions deeply and potentially create better alternatives, rather than simply avoiding effort. The author frames it as an exercise to improve your foundations and understand your tools.
