    <h2>12ft.io Taken Down</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The News Media Alliance (NMA) is strongly criticizing 12ft.io, a service that bypasses paywalls on news websites, calling it blatant copyright infringement and a threat to the sustainability of online journalism. The NMA argues that 12ft.io undermines the investment news publishers make in creating original content by allowing users to access articles without subscribing. The service essentially steals content and deprives publishers of revenue needed to support their operations.
</p>
<p>
The NMA highlights the importance of subscriptions and advertising revenue for news organizations to continue providing quality journalism. By circumventing paywalls, 12ft.io disrupts the business model that supports news production. The organization emphasizes that news is not free to produce and that publishers rely on various revenue streams to cover the costs of reporting, editing, and distribution.
</p>
<p>
The NMA is advocating for the protection of intellectual property rights and urging users to support news organizations by subscribing to their services. They are exploring all available options to combat 12ft.io and similar services that infringe on copyright and threaten the future of journalism.
