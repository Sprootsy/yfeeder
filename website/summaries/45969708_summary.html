  <p>The provided text is a link to a GitHub repository named "guts" by "coder." Based on the repository's README, "guts" is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the process of developing and managing cloud-based development environments, particularly those utilizing Coder. Coder is a platform that enables users to define and deploy consistent, reproducible development environments in the cloud. "guts" simplifies interactions with Coder by providing commands for common tasks such as creating, updating, and deleting workspaces, connecting to workspaces via SSH or VS Code, managing templates, and accessing logs and other information about the Coder deployment. The tool is intended to improve developer productivity and reduce the overhead associated with managing cloud development environments.</p>
