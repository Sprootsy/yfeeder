    This essay, titled "Against 'Character'” by Fran Sans and analyzed by Emily Sneddon, delves into the concept of character development in fiction, particularly critiquing the prevalent notion that characters must undergo significant, transformative arcs to be considered compelling or realistic. Sans challenges the conventional wisdom that equates "good" character writing with profound change, suggesting that such emphasis often leads to predictable, uninspired narratives.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sans argues that the demand for characters to learn, grow, and evolve can be restrictive, forcing writers into formulaic patterns where characters are essentially "fixed" by the end of the story, having resolved their internal conflicts and adopted new perspectives. This emphasis on change, according to Sans, overlooks the complexities and nuances of human behavior, where individuals often remain consistent in their core traits and beliefs despite facing various life experiences.

    The essay also examines the pressure on authors to create "likable" characters, which Sans sees as another constraint on authentic character development. The desire to make characters relatable or sympathetic can lead to sanitized portrayals that lack depth and complexity. Sans advocates for embracing flawed, contradictory, and even unlikeable characters, arguing that these are often more realistic and engaging than idealized figures.

    Furthermore, Sans critiques the tendency to prioritize character arc over other aspects of storytelling, such as plot, theme, and world-building. The essay suggests that an overemphasis on character development can result in narratives that are character-driven to the detriment of other important elements, leading to stories that feel unbalanced or incomplete.

    Instead of adhering to rigid notions of character arcs and likability, Sans encourages writers to explore the full spectrum of human behavior and to create characters who are complex, contradictory, and true to themselves, even if they don't undergo significant transformations. The essay champions the idea that characters can be compelling simply by being authentically themselves, without needing to conform to conventional expectations of growth or change.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ultimately, "Against 'Character'" is a call for greater freedom and experimentation in character writing, urging authors to resist the pressure to create characters who fit neatly into predefined molds and to instead embrace the messy, unpredictable nature of human experience.
