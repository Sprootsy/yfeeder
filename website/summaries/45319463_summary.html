    <h2>Amazon to end commingling after years of complaints from brands and sellers</h2>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>Amazon is ending its commingling program, which combined the inventory of multiple sellers for the same product in its warehouses. This decision comes after years of complaints from brands and sellers regarding counterfeit products and quality control issues. Under the commingling system, products from different sellers were stored together, identified only by the product's ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) rather than a unique serial number or identifier for each seller. This created opportunities for unscrupulous sellers to introduce counterfeit or substandard goods into the shared inventory pool, damaging the reputation of legitimate brands and sellers when customers received these inferior products.</p>

<p>The change means that sellers using Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) will now be required to use a serial number or similar unique identifier to track their products within Amazon's warehouses. This will enable Amazon to trace each product back to its original seller, improving accountability and making it more difficult for counterfeit or low-quality items to infiltrate the supply chain. While Amazon had previously offered a stickerless, commingled inventory option, the company is now mandating that all FBA inventory be tracked individually.</p>

<p>The move is expected to be welcomed by brands and sellers who have long argued that commingling made it challenging to protect their intellectual property and maintain product quality. By ending the practice, Amazon aims to enhance trust and safety on its platform, addressing concerns about counterfeit goods and ensuring customers receive authentic products. This shift could also lead to increased costs and complexity for some sellers, as they will need to implement systems for applying and tracking unique identifiers on their products. However, many see this as a necessary step to safeguard their brands and ensure fair competition within the Amazon marketplace.</p>

<p>The decision reflects Amazon's ongoing efforts to combat counterfeiting and improve the overall shopping experience for customers. By increasing traceability and accountability, Amazon is signaling its commitment to protecting brands and maintaining the integrity of its platform. The transition away from commingling is expected to take time to fully implement, but the long-term benefits are anticipated to outweigh any short-term challenges for both sellers and Amazon itself.</p>
