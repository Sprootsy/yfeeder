 <h3>Summary</h3>
 <p>The article discusses the concept of "Practice Surface Area" (PSA) and how increasing it can accelerate learning and skill acquisition. PSA refers to the amount of real-world application and experimentation one engages in while learning a new skill. The author argues that traditional learning methods, like passively consuming information through books or courses, often have a low PSA, leading to slow progress and a lack of practical understanding. To effectively learn and master a skill, one should actively seek opportunities to apply their knowledge, experiment with different approaches, and receive feedback on their performance.</p>
 <p>The article emphasizes that learning is most effective when it involves active engagement, experimentation, and reflection. It suggests that instead of focusing solely on consuming more information, learners should prioritize creating, building, and testing their abilities in real-world scenarios. This involves pushing oneself outside of one's comfort zone and embracing failure as a valuable learning opportunity.</p>
 <p>The author also highlights the importance of seeking feedback from others. Feedback provides valuable insights into one's strengths and weaknesses, allowing for targeted improvement. By actively soliciting feedback and incorporating it into one's practice, learners can accelerate their progress and develop a deeper understanding of the skill they are trying to acquire.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the article stresses the significance of deliberate practice. Deliberate practice involves focusing on specific areas of improvement, setting clear goals, and actively monitoring progress. By engaging in deliberate practice, learners can optimize their learning process and achieve faster results.</p>
 <p>In essence, the article advocates for a shift in mindset from passive consumption to active engagement. It encourages learners to prioritize creating, experimenting, and seeking feedback in order to maximize their Practice Surface Area and accelerate their skill acquisition.</p>
