<p>The article is a README file for Pangolin, a lightweight portable computer vision library for managing OpenGL display / interaction and abstracting video input. It's designed for prototyping rapidly and is particularly useful for robotics, computer vision, and augmented reality applications.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>Pangolin is a header-only C++ library intended to simplify the creation of interactive OpenGL-based visualizations and video input handling. Its primary goal is to enable rapid prototyping in the fields of robotics, computer vision, and augmented reality. The library handles the cumbersome aspects of OpenGL setup and window management, allowing developers to focus on their core algorithms and visual representations. It achieves this by providing a high-level abstraction for creating interactive displays, processing user input (keyboard and mouse), and integrating various video streams as input.</p>

<p>The library emphasizes portability, aiming to be compatible with a wide range of platforms and compilers. It supports various video formats through libraries like FFmpeg, allowing for flexible video input from files, cameras, or network streams. The user interface features, while basic, are sufficient for creating interactive demos and debugging tools. Key features include a straightforward API for creating and managing OpenGL views, handling user input events, and displaying various data types, such as images, point clouds, and 3D models.</p>

<p>Pangolin's design philosophy centers around minimal dependencies and a header-only implementation to ease integration into existing projects. The library's interactive elements enable real-time manipulation and exploration of data, which is invaluable for debugging and refining computer vision and robotics algorithms. The video input abstraction allows users to easily switch between different video sources without modifying the core visualization code. Furthermore, Pangolin's modular architecture allows users to easily incorporate additional features or customize existing components to better suit the requirements of their project.</p>

<p>The README provides installation instructions, example code snippets, and links to more comprehensive documentation. It also highlights the library's cross-platform nature, mentioning support for Linux, macOS, and Windows. By abstracting away the low-level details of OpenGL and video input, Pangolin allows researchers and developers to iterate faster and create compelling visualizations for their projects.</p>
