  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article is a README file for a software project called "brush" hosted on GitHub. Brush is a command-line tool designed for brushing (i.e., cleaning and formatting) data from various sources. It focuses on making data transformations and manipulation easy and efficient, especially when dealing with CSV data. The tool allows users to define transformations in a configuration file and apply them to input data via the command line. It provides a flexible and configurable way to process data, supporting various data types, operations, and output formats.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tool can load data from files, standard input, or URLs, and supports various data formats, including CSV, JSON, and potentially others through extension. It also supports writing to files, standard output, or other destinations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Key features include: defining transformations in a human-readable configuration file (likely YAML or JSON), performing operations such as renaming columns, filtering rows based on conditions, modifying data values, converting data types, and generating new columns. It also supports the use of plugins or extensions to add custom functionality, which are written in Python. Brush also supports features such as handling null or missing values, error handling, and data validation. It is intended to be used in data pipelines, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and other data manipulation tasks.
