The collision involved a single-engine Piper PA-28-140 aircraft, N140PL, and a twin-engine Beechcraft BE-58 airplane, N987RA. Both airplanes were destroyed, and all three occupants of the Piper and both occupants of the Beechcraft died.

The Piper was departing from runway 17, while the Beechcraft was performing touch-and-go landings on the same runway. Preliminary information indicates that the Piper began its takeoff roll without clearance from air traffic control. Simultaneously, the Beechcraft was on its landing roll after a touch-and-go. The collision occurred when the Piper became airborne and struck the Beechcraft.
