    <h2>Apple pulls iPhone torrent app from AltStore PAL in Europe</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p><b>Summary:</b></p>
<p>Apple has taken action against several alternative iOS app marketplaces and sideloading tools, including iTorrent, AltStore PAL, and the European app marketplace, Pal. These actions come shortly after Apple implemented changes to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which requires allowing alternative app distribution methods on iOS devices in the EU. Apple's crackdown involves revoking developer certificates, effectively disabling these platforms from distributing apps and preventing users from installing them.</p>

<p>iTorrent, a popular BitTorrent client for iOS, was removed from the App Store and subsequently faced certificate revocation, rendering it unusable. AltStore PAL, a prominent alternative app store gaining traction in the EU, also had its developer certificate revoked. AltStore PAL was particularly notable because it offered a way to install apps outside of the official App Store, addressing a key aspect of the DMA requirements. The developer of AltStore PAL, Riley Testut, confirmed the certificate revocation and criticized Apple's actions.</p>

<p>Pal, another alternative iOS app marketplace focused on the European market, also experienced certificate revocation. These revocations have raised concerns about Apple's commitment to genuinely complying with the DMA and allowing fair competition in app distribution. Critics argue that Apple's implementation of the DMA requirements is overly restrictive and that the company is using its control over the iOS ecosystem to stifle alternative app stores.</p>

<p>The core issue revolves around Apple's control over developer certificates, which are necessary for apps to run on iOS devices. By revoking these certificates, Apple can effectively shut down any app or platform it deems to be in violation of its policies, even if those policies are perceived as anti-competitive under the DMA. This situation highlights the tension between Apple's desire to maintain control over its platform and the EU's efforts to promote competition and user choice in the digital market.</p>

<p>The developers affected are exploring ways to circumvent these restrictions, but the future of alternative app stores on iOS in the EU remains uncertain. The conflict between Apple and alternative app distribution platforms is likely to continue as both sides navigate the legal and technical complexities of the DMA.</p>
