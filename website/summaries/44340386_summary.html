<h3>Summary</h3>
The article on filmlabs.org documents the experience of using a modified Kinoton FP35 projector for 16mm film projection at LaborBerlin e.V. The Kinoton FP35, originally designed for 35mm film, was adapted to accommodate 16mm film. This adaptation involved significant modifications, primarily to the film gate, sprockets, and lens, to ensure the smaller 16mm film could be properly transported, focused, and projected.

The project aimed to provide LaborBerlin, a self-organized film lab focused on photochemical film practices, with a high-quality 16mm projection system. The rationale behind using a converted 35mm projector was the potential for superior performance and stability compared to standard 16mm projectors. The robust construction of 35mm projectors, like the Kinoton FP35, offered a steadier image and more reliable film handling, particularly important for experimental and archival film screenings.

The modification process involved several key steps. The original 35mm gate was replaced with a custom-built 16mm gate. This gate was precisely engineered to hold the 16mm film flat and steady during projection. Similarly, the 35mm sprockets were exchanged for 16mm sprockets, which accurately engage with the perforations on the 16mm film to ensure smooth and consistent film transport. The lens was also replaced to match the 16mm film format and projection distance. Adjustments to the projector's mechanics and electronics were necessary to accommodate the different film speed and gate configurations.

The article details the challenges encountered during the conversion, such as ensuring proper film threading, maintaining consistent film tension, and achieving optimal image sharpness. Solutions involved fine-tuning the gate pressure, adjusting the sprocket alignment, and experimenting with different lenses and projection distances. The project benefited from the expertise of various individuals with knowledge in film projection, mechanics, and optics.

The modified Kinoton FP35 projector provided LaborBerlin with a reliable and high-performance 16mm projection system. The quality of the projected image was significantly improved compared to standard 16mm projectors, with better image steadiness, brightness, and overall clarity. This allowed LaborBerlin to showcase experimental and archival 16mm films in the best possible quality, enhancing the viewing experience for audiences. The project also served as a valuable learning experience for the members of LaborBerlin, deepening their understanding of film projection technology and fostering skills in film handling and maintenance.

The documentation serves as a resource for other film labs or individuals interested in undertaking similar projector conversion projects. It provides insights into the technical considerations, challenges, and solutions involved in adapting a 35mm projector for 16mm film projection. By sharing their experiences, the authors hope to encourage further experimentation and innovation in the field of photochemical film practices.
