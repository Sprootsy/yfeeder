    The article is a documentation page for owhisper, an open-source, self-hostable AI tool designed to transcribe audio and video into text. It leverages the Whisper ASR model developed by OpenAI. owhisper allows users to convert various audio/video formats into transcripts in multiple languages, offering an alternative to cloud-based transcription services. It emphasizes data privacy and control, as the transcription process happens locally on the user's machine or server. The documentation covers the project's core features, including the ability to transcribe media files, translate the transcript to English (if the source language is different), create subtitles (SRT format), and generate VTT (Web Video Text Tracks) files.

    The documentation also details owhisper's key benefits: it's open-source (MIT license), ensuring transparency and community contributions; it's self-hostable, giving users complete control over their data; and it supports multiple languages for both transcription and translation.  It also mentions that owhisper is free to use and respects user privacy by processing data locally. The document briefly alludes to future features, such as integration with other Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the AI capabilities of the tool. It states that the tool does not collect any data.
