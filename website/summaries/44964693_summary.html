<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The webpage is dedicated to Fermat's Last Theorem (FLT), a famous problem in mathematics that remained unsolved for over 350 years. It states that no three positive integers a, b, and c can satisfy the equation a<sup>n</sup> + b<sup>n</sup> = c<sup>n</sup> for any integer value of n greater than 2.</p>

<p>The site provides an introduction to the theorem and its historical context, highlighting Pierre de Fermat's original conjecture written in the margin of a book. It explains how Fermat claimed to have a proof but never documented it, leading to centuries of effort by mathematicians to either prove or disprove the theorem.</p>

<p>The site likely discusses the various attempts to solve FLT, including work on specific cases of n (e.g., n=3, 4, 5) and the development of new mathematical tools in the process. It would touch on the contributions of mathematicians like Euler, Sophie Germain, and Kummer, who made significant progress but fell short of a complete solution.</p>

<p>A key aspect of the resource is likely the explanation of the eventual proof by Andrew Wiles in 1994. The proof is complex and relies on deep results in the theory of elliptic curves and modular forms. The site would probably mention the connection between FLT and the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture (now the Modularity Theorem), which Wiles proved for semistable elliptic curves, a result sufficient to establish Fermat's Last Theorem.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it might discuss the impact of the proof on number theory and mathematics in general. Wiles's work not only solved a long-standing problem but also spurred further research and advanced our understanding of the connections between different areas of mathematics.</p>

<p>In essence, the webpage serves as an educational resource, offering insights into the history, the mathematical concepts involved, and the significance of Fermat's Last Theorem and its resolution.</p>
