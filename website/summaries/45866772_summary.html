<p>The GitHub repository "bumble-berry-pi" by samcervantes details a project focused on creating a Raspberry Pi-based Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sniffer, also referred to as a BLE scanner. The project aims to passively capture and analyze BLE traffic, providing insights into nearby BLE devices and their communication patterns. The repository includes code, documentation, and instructions for setting up and using the BLE sniffer.</p>

<p>The project leverages the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi, a low-cost, single-board computer, combined with a Bluetooth adapter to capture BLE advertisements and data packets. The software component involves custom scripts, often written in Python, to process the raw BLE data obtained from the Bluetooth adapter. The software decodes the BLE packets, extracts relevant information like device addresses, advertising data, and signal strength, and can store this data for further analysis.</p>

<p>The primary use case for such a BLE sniffer is to monitor and understand the BLE landscape in a specific environment. This can include identifying the types and numbers of BLE devices present, observing their advertising intervals, and analyzing the data they transmit. This information is valuable for various applications, such as security auditing, IoT device discovery, reverse engineering, and indoor localization.</p>

<p>The repository likely contains instructions on how to configure the Raspberry Pi, install necessary software libraries (such as those for Bluetooth communication), and run the sniffing scripts. It may also provide guidance on filtering and interpreting the captured BLE data, potentially using tools like Wireshark or custom data visualization methods.</p>

<p>A key aspect of the project is its passive nature. The BLE sniffer typically does not transmit any data or actively interact with the BLE devices it is monitoring. This makes it a discreet and non-intrusive way to gather information about the BLE environment. However, it also means that the sniffer can only capture data that is being broadcast by the BLE devices, and cannot access data that is only exchanged during a connected session.</p>

<p>Security professionals and IoT developers often use such tools for vulnerability assessments and to understand the communication protocols of BLE devices. hobbyists might use it to reverse engineer communication of their IoT gadgets.</p>
