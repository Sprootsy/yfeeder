    <h2>Ty: A fast Python type checker and language server</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <p>Ty is a work-in-progress static type checker for Python, intended to be fast and easy to integrate. It's developed by Astral, the same team behind Ruff. Ty aims to address the slow performance and complex integration often associated with existing Python type checkers like mypy.</p>

  <p>The stated goals of Ty are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fast type checking:</strong> Ty is built for speed, aiming to provide quick feedback during development.</li>
    <li><strong>Easy integration:</strong>  The developers want Ty to be readily integrated into existing workflows and tools.</li>
    <li><strong>Modern architecture:</strong> Ty is built with a modern architecture for better performance and maintainability.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The repository's README provides basic usage examples. Ty can be run on a Python file using the command `ty check <filename>.py`. It will then analyze the file and report any type errors it finds.</p>

  <p>The project is under active development, and contributions are welcome. The repository includes information on how to build and run Ty locally, as well as guidelines for contributing code.</p>

  <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Ty is a new static type checker for Python.</li>
    <li>It is being developed by Astral, the creators of Ruff.</li>
    <li>It focuses on speed, easy integration, and a modern architecture.</li>
    <li>It is still a work-in-progress.</li>
    <li>Contributions are welcome.</li>
