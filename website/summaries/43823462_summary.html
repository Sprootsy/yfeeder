   <h3>Summary</h3>
   <p>
     The article is a blog post by Lars Ingebrigtsen discussing Ursula K. Le Guin's "The Books of Earthsea" as part of a book club discussion in 2025. The author reflects on rereading the series and how their perspective has evolved since their initial encounter with the books in their youth.

     Ingebrigtsen emphasizes that "A Wizard of Earthsea" significantly impacted him when he first read it, particularly its exploration of responsibility, consequences, and the balance of nature. He contrasts this with his initial preference for more straightforward fantasy narratives, noting that Earthsea's nuanced approach to magic and morality resonated deeply despite not fitting his prior expectations. He appreciates Le Guin's departure from typical power fantasies, focusing instead on the weight of wielding power and the importance of understanding true names and the equilibrium of the world.

     The author notes that rereading the books as an adult has brought a deeper appreciation for the themes of death, aging, and societal issues explored in later Earthsea books like "The Farthest Shore," "Tehanu," and "The Other Wind." He acknowledges initially disliking "Tehanu" due to its slower pace and focus on a different perspective, particularly regarding gender roles and the lives of women in Earthsea. However, he now recognizes its value in expanding the world and challenging traditional fantasy tropes.

     Ingebrigtsen further reflects on Le Guin's skillful world-building, the consistent and believable magic system, and the depth of the characters. He mentions that while the plots themselves may not always be the primary focus, the series as a whole offers a rich and meaningful exploration of complex themes relevant to both fantasy literature and real-world concerns. The article also briefly touches upon the collection of short stories "Tales from Earthsea," which provides additional insights into the world and its inhabitants.
