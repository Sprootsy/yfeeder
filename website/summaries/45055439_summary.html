   <h2>Summary</h2>
   <p>
     Martin Fowler's article "Build Your Own Coding Agent" explores the concept of creating coding agents, which are AI-powered tools designed to automate and enhance software development tasks. The article emphasizes that while Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, building effective coding agents requires more than just connecting an LLM to a code editor. It involves carefully designing the agent's architecture, providing it with the right tools and context, and implementing mechanisms for iterative refinement.
   </p>
   <p>
     The article begins by outlining the potential benefits of coding agents, such as increased developer productivity, reduced errors, and faster development cycles. However, it also acknowledges the challenges in building such agents, including the need for precise instructions, the ability to handle complex codebases, and the capacity to learn from mistakes.
   </p>
   <p>
     Fowler emphasizes the importance of breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps. He suggests that a coding agent should have a clear understanding of the development process, including planning, coding, testing, and debugging. The agent should be able to use various tools, such as compilers, linters, and debuggers, to perform these tasks effectively.
   </p>
   <p>
     A key aspect of building a coding agent is providing it with sufficient context. This includes not only the specific task at hand but also information about the codebase, the project's architecture, and the team's coding standards. The agent should be able to access and process this information to make informed decisions.
   </p>
   <p>
     The article also highlights the importance of iterative refinement. Coding agents are unlikely to be perfect from the start, so it's crucial to have mechanisms for identifying and correcting errors. This can involve human feedback, automated testing, or a combination of both. The agent should be able to learn from its mistakes and improve its performance over time.
   </p>
   <p>
     Fowler introduces a basic architecture for a coding agent, involving components for planning, coding, testing and reviewing. He then dives into using LLMs to perform each of these steps, highlighting the challenges.

     The article further discusses the role of prompts and prompt engineering in guiding the LLM. It emphasizes that crafting precise and detailed prompts is essential for getting the desired results. The agent may need to use different prompts for different tasks, and it may also need to adapt its prompts based on the context and the available tools.
   </p>
   <p>
     The article also touches upon the ethical considerations of using coding agents. It acknowledges that these agents could potentially displace human developers, and it emphasizes the importance of using them responsibly and ethically. The article suggests that coding agents should be used to augment human developers, not replace them entirely.
   </p>
   <p>
     The article concludes by emphasizing that building effective coding agents is an ongoing process that requires experimentation, iteration, and a deep understanding of both AI and software development principles.
