The article discusses upcoming changes to Ubuntu 25.10 concerning core system utilities and the inclusion of Makeself.
</p>
<p>
<b>Summary:</b>
</p>
<p>
Ubuntu 25.10 is slated to include notable updates related to core system utilities. The article highlights that Ubuntu 25.10 will transition to GNU Coreutils 9.4. This update to Coreutils is significant because it will drop support for certain older or less common architectures, specifically those predating the year 2000. This move allows for code modernization and efficiency improvements by removing compatibility layers for obsolete hardware. This change could potentially affect users who are running Ubuntu on very old or embedded systems.

<p>
The article also mentions the inclusion of Makeself, a utility for creating self-extracting archives on Unix-like systems. Makeself allows a directory to be packaged into a single, self-extracting executable archive. This is particularly useful for distributing software or data packages that need to be easily installed or extracted without requiring specific archive management tools. Makeself archives are scripts that, when executed, extract the contents they contain to a temporary directory and then execute a specified command. Makeself is expected to simplify the distribution and installation of certain software components within the Ubuntu ecosystem.
