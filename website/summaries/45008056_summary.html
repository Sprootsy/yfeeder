    <strong>Summary:</strong>
    The Wall Street Journal opinion piece argues against the U.S. government's potential equity stake in Intel through the CHIPS Act. While the CHIPS Act aims to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers, the author contends that direct government ownership of company stock is not the appropriate mechanism. The article raises concerns about potential government interference in corporate governance, market distortions, and the risk of political influence over business decisions. It suggests that while subsidies and other incentives can be justified to encourage domestic chip production, taking an equity stake crosses a line and could lead to unintended negative consequences for both Intel and the broader market. The author emphasizes the importance of maintaining a clear separation between the government's role in promoting national security and its involvement in private enterprise. The piece advocates for alternative approaches that support the semiconductor industry without compromising the principles of free markets and corporate independence.
