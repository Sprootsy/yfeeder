<p>The article "Tech Companies Apparently Do Not Understand Why We Dislike AI" by Soatok, published on May 4, 2025, discusses the pervasive disconnect between the tech industry's enthusiasm for AI and the public's growing dissatisfaction with it. The author argues that tech companies fundamentally misunderstand the reasons behind this dislike, often attributing it to mere technophobia or a lack of understanding about how AI works.</p>

<p>Soatok posits that the core issue isn't a fear of technology itself, but rather the tangible negative impacts AI systems have on people's lives. These impacts include job displacement due to automation, the proliferation of AI-generated spam and misinformation, and the erosion of trust in online content as AI makes it increasingly difficult to distinguish between authentic and synthetic media. Furthermore, the author highlights the ethical concerns surrounding AI, particularly its tendency to perpetuate and amplify existing biases present in the data it's trained on. This can lead to discriminatory outcomes in areas like hiring, loan applications, and even criminal justice.</p>

<p>The article criticizes the tech industry's focus on the potential benefits of AI while downplaying or ignoring the real-world harms it inflicts. This disconnect is further exacerbated by the industry's tendency to frame AI as a magical solution to complex problems, often overhyping its capabilities and failing to acknowledge its limitations. The author argues that this hype creates unrealistic expectations and fuels disappointment when AI systems fail to deliver on their promises.</p>

<p>Soatok also points out that many people dislike AI because it feels impersonal and dehumanizing. Interactions with AI chatbots and automated systems often lack the empathy and understanding that humans can provide, leading to frustrating and unsatisfying experiences. Additionally, the increasing reliance on AI in various aspects of life raises concerns about privacy and data security, as AI systems require vast amounts of data to function effectively, often collected without the explicit consent or awareness of individuals.</p>

<p>The article concludes by urging tech companies to take a more critical and responsible approach to AI development. This includes addressing the ethical concerns surrounding AI, mitigating its negative impacts on society, and prioritizing human well-being over technological advancement. The author suggests that a more transparent and accountable approach to AI development is necessary to bridge the gap between the tech industry and the public, and to ensure that AI benefits society as a whole rather than just a select few.</p>
