    The article is an interview with Jef Raskin conducted by Dr. Dobb's Journal. Raskin, a computer scientist and human-computer interface expert, discusses his views on computer design, user interfaces, and the future of computing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Raskin begins by emphasizing the importance of designing computers and software with the user in mind, arguing that usability should be the primary focus, even above technical considerations. He critiques the complexity of existing systems, advocating for simplicity and consistency in user interfaces. He believes that many software features are unnecessary and only serve to confuse users.
  </p>
  <p>
    He elaborates on his concept of "information appliances," which are dedicated devices designed for specific tasks, such as writing, email, or web browsing. He argues that these appliances are more user-friendly than general-purpose computers because they eliminate unnecessary complexity and offer a more focused experience. Raskin envisions a future where people use a variety of specialized appliances rather than a single, all-purpose computer.

    Raskin also discusses the limitations of the mouse as an input device. While acknowledging its usefulness in certain contexts, he suggests that it is not the ideal solution for all tasks. He mentions alternative input methods, such as touchscreens and voice recognition, as potential replacements or supplements to the mouse. He also argues that the keyboard layout is inefficient.
  </p>
  <p>
    He criticizes the trend of adding more and more features to software, arguing that it leads to "feature creep" and makes software more difficult to use. He believes that developers should focus on creating lean, efficient applications that perform a specific task well.
  </p>
  <p>
    He mentions the Canon Cat, a computer he designed in the 1980s, as an example of his design philosophy. The Cat featured a simple, intuitive interface and was designed for writing and text editing. Although it was not a commercial success, Raskin believes that it demonstrated the potential of a user-centered approach to computer design.
  </p>
  <p>
    Raskin suggests that the software industry is too focused on replicating existing paradigms and not enough on exploring new ideas. He advocates for more experimentation and innovation in user interface design. He encourages developers to think outside the box and challenge conventional wisdom.
  </p>
  <p>
    He also discusses the importance of documentation and training. He argues that well-written documentation and effective training programs are essential for helping users learn how to use software effectively. He criticizes the poor quality of documentation that often accompanies software products.
  </p>
  <p>
    In general, Raskin advocates for a more humanistic approach to computer design, one that prioritizes the needs and abilities of users. He believes that computers should be tools that empower people, rather than machines that intimidate and frustrate them.
