  <p>Darklang, a programming language, and infrastructure designed to simplify serverless backend development, has announced that it is going fully open source. The entire Darklang codebase, including the compiler, editor, and infrastructure code, will be available under the Apache 2.0 license. The move is motivated by the belief that open sourcing will foster community involvement and accelerate the development and adoption of the language. The original developers envision a collaborative environment where users can contribute to the language's evolution, fix bugs, and build new features. They also acknowledge that Darklang hasn't achieved its initial goals in its current form and hope the community can help steer it toward greater success.</p>

  <p>The article details the history of Darklang, explaining that it was created to address the complexities of backend development. The goal was to provide a seamless, integrated environment where developers could write, deploy, and operate backend services more easily than with traditional tools and architectures. Key features of Darklang included a custom language tailored for backend tasks, an integrated editor with real-time feedback, and a serverless infrastructure that automated deployment and scaling. The system allowed "tracing", where a single request could be followed through the system. The original team hoped to revolutionize backend development, but struggled to gain widespread adoption.</p>

  <p>The decision to open source was made after considering various paths forward, and the developers decided that this offers the best chance for Darklang to realize its potential. They believe that a community-driven approach will bring fresh perspectives, identify new use cases, and ultimately improve the language and platform. The open-source project will require community members to become maintainers and contributors to drive the project forward.</p>

  <p>The announcement includes practical information for those interested in contributing. The Darklang repository is available on GitHub, and the developers encourage users to explore the code, report issues, and submit pull requests. They also plan to create a comprehensive guide for new contributors to help them get started. The team also highlights their commitment to supporting the open-source community through documentation, communication channels, and mentorship.</p>

  <p>The blog post expresses optimism about the future of Darklang as an open-source project. The original developers are eager to see how the community will shape its direction and what innovative applications will be built using the language. The author hopes the community will contribute to areas such as language improvements, library development, tooling enhancements, and infrastructure optimizations. They believe that open sourcing Darklang will bring the project closer to its original vision of simplifying backend development for everyone.</p>
