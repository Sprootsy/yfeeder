   Miguel Grinberg discusses his experiences and frustrations with using generative AI coding tools and agents for software development. He argues that while these tools show promise, they currently do not meet his needs due to several key limitations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Grinberg begins by acknowledging the potential benefits of AI-assisted coding, such as generating boilerplate code, suggesting code completions, and even creating entire functions or modules. He emphasizes that he has actively tried to incorporate these tools into his workflow, hoping to improve his productivity and reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, his experience has been largely disappointing. One of the primary issues he identifies is the lack of deep understanding of the project's context and requirements. Generative AI often produces code that is syntactically correct but semantically wrong, meaning it doesn't actually solve the intended problem or integrate properly with the existing codebase. This necessitates extensive manual review and debugging, which can be more time-consuming than writing the code from scratch.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another significant challenge is the "AI hallucinations," where the AI confidently presents code or solutions that are entirely fabricated or based on outdated information. Grinberg notes that these hallucinations can be difficult to detect, especially for developers who are not already familiar with the specific area of code being generated. This can lead to subtle bugs and unexpected behavior that are hard to trace.
  </p>
  <p>
   Grinberg also points out the limitations in dealing with complex or non-standard problems. Generative AI tends to excel at generating code for well-documented and widely used libraries and frameworks, but it struggles when faced with unique or custom implementations. In such cases, the AI-generated code is often generic and requires substantial modification to fit the specific needs of the project.
  </p>
  <p>
   Furthermore, he critiques the current interaction model with AI coding tools. He finds that the back-and-forth communication required to refine the AI's output can be inefficient and disruptive. He envisions a more seamless integration where the AI understands the developer's intent more intuitively and can provide more accurate and relevant suggestions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Grinberg raises concerns about the potential for AI to introduce security vulnerabilities. Since the AI-generated code is often based on patterns and examples found online, it may inadvertently include insecure coding practices or outdated dependencies. Developers need to be vigilant in reviewing and auditing the AI's output to mitigate these risks.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, Grinberg questions the long-term impact of relying too heavily on AI coding tools. He worries that it could lead to a decline in developers' fundamental coding skills and problem-solving abilities. He argues that while AI can be a valuable assistant, it should not replace the core skills and expertise of human programmers.
  </p>
  <p>
   In conclusion, while acknowledging the rapid progress in generative AI, Grinberg believes that these tools are not yet a reliable or efficient substitute for human developers in many scenarios. He emphasizes the need for further improvements in areas such as contextual understanding, accuracy, and integration with development workflows.
