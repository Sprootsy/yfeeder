<p>Klarna is reinvesting in human talent for its customer service operations after initially relying heavily on an AI-powered chatbot.

Klarna is aiming to strike a balance between AI and human interaction to optimize its customer service and improve overall customer experience. The decision comes after a period of cost-cutting measures, including layoffs, and a renewed focus on profitability. Klarna's CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, acknowledged the importance of human agents in resolving complex issues and providing empathy. The company is actively hiring customer service representatives to complement its AI chatbot and ensure customers receive the support they need. Klarna believes that by investing in both AI and human talent, it can provide a superior customer experience and maintain its position as a leader in the buy now, pay later industry.</p>
