    <h2>The worst possible antitrust outcome</h2>

   Cory Doctorow's article "Unpunishing Process" discusses the increasing trend of companies using copyright and "anti-circumvention" laws (specifically Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act) to control how users and competitors interact with their products, even when there is no actual copyright infringement. He calls this "unpunishing process," meaning that actions that should be considered normal business practices or fair use are being punished under the guise of copyright protection.

   The article highlights several examples of this phenomenon. One example is the case of Chamberlain, a garage door opener manufacturer, using copyright to prevent competitors from making compatible remote controls. Another involves John Deere, who uses copyright to prevent farmers from repairing their own tractors, forcing them to rely on authorized (and often expensive) dealerships. Keurig's DRM on coffee pods to prevent the use of third-party pods is also mentioned. All these companies, and many others, use Section 1201 to create monopolies over aftermarket products and repair services, stifling competition and limiting consumer choice.

   Doctorow argues that these practices are a perversion of copyright law, which was originally intended to protect creative works, not to grant manufacturers control over the entire lifecycle of their products. He contends that Section 1201 has become a tool for rent-seeking behavior, allowing companies to extract more money from consumers by locking them into their ecosystems and preventing them from using competing products or services.

   The article also points out the chilling effect these tactics have on independent repair shops and tinkerers, who are often threatened with legal action for simply trying to fix or modify products they own. This restricts innovation and reduces the lifespan of products, contributing to e-waste and environmental problems.

   Doctorow criticizes the legal system for allowing these abuses to continue, arguing that courts have been too deferential to copyright holders and have failed to recognize the broader implications of Section 1201 on competition and consumer rights. He calls for reforms to copyright law to prevent companies from using it to stifle competition and control the aftermarket for their products. He suggests revisiting Section 1201 to narrow its scope and ensure that it only applies to actual copyright infringement, not to the circumvention of technical measures designed to prevent competition or repair. Ultimately, he advocates for a legal framework that promotes innovation, consumer choice, and the right to repair.
