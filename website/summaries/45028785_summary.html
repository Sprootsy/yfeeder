   The article discusses the efforts of Bryan Creely, a tech worker who became frustrated with "ghost jobs" – job postings that are not actually open or are used to collect resumes – and is now advocating for a national ban on the practice in the United States. Creely's experience with ghost jobs motivated him to take action and raise awareness about the issue. He is working with lawmakers to propose legislation that would require companies to be more transparent about their hiring processes and to remove job postings that are not actively being filled.

   Ghost jobs can be misleading and frustrating for job seekers, as they waste time and effort applying for positions that do not exist. They can also create a false sense of opportunity in the job market. The article highlights how prevalent ghost jobs have become, particularly in the tech industry, and the negative impact they have on job seekers' morale and financial well-being. Creely argues that banning ghost jobs would promote fairness and transparency in the hiring process, ensuring that job seekers have access to accurate information about available positions.

   The proposed legislation aims to address several aspects of ghost jobs. First, it would require companies to clearly indicate whether a job posting represents a genuinely open position. Second, it would mandate that companies remove job postings within a reasonable timeframe if the position has been filled or is no longer available. Third, it would establish penalties for companies that violate the law, such as fines or other sanctions. Creely believes that these measures would deter companies from posting ghost jobs and create a more level playing field for job seekers.

   The article also explores the reasons why companies engage in ghost job postings. Some companies use them to collect resumes for future openings, while others use them to create the illusion of growth and success. In some cases, ghost jobs may be the result of poor communication or coordination within a company's human resources department. Regardless of the reason, Creely argues that the practice is unethical and harmful to job seekers.

   The effort to ban ghost jobs has gained momentum, with several lawmakers expressing support for the proposed legislation. However, there are also challenges to overcome, such as convincing lawmakers of the need for a national ban and addressing concerns about the potential impact on businesses. Despite these challenges, Creely remains optimistic that his efforts will lead to meaningful change and help to protect job seekers from the deceptive practice of ghost job postings.
