  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The Port of Seattle has seen a downturn in container ship traffic in 2023. Port officials attribute this decline primarily to tariffs, but also to increased competition from other ports, particularly those in Canada and along the Gulf Coast. These factors have led shipping companies to reroute their vessels. The port is not expecting any container ships in January 2024 due to the economic pressures and tariffs that have diverted ships away from Seattle. While the port is facing these challenges in its container shipping sector, it remains focused on other aspects of its business, such as cruise ships and cargo handling.</p>
