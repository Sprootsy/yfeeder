   <h2>Summary</h2>
   <p>
     Hyundai Motor Group's plans to start mass production at its new electric vehicle (EV) battery cell plant in Georgia, a joint venture with SK On, have been delayed by at least three months. The start of production, initially scheduled for early 2025, is now expected to begin in May 2025 at the earliest. This delay is primarily attributed to construction challenges at the site.
   </p>
   <p>
     The $4.3 billion plant in Bartow County, northwest of Atlanta, aims to produce 300,000 EV batteries annually, which will then be supplied to Hyundai Motor Groupâ€™s EV assembly plant in the same state. The Hyundai Metaplant America (HMA) facility, currently under construction, is expected to begin production in late 2024. The battery plant is crucial for Hyundai's EV production strategy in North America, particularly in light of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which offers tax credits for EVs assembled in North America and using a certain percentage of domestically produced battery components.

     Despite the delay, both Hyundai and SK On remain committed to the project. SK On reaffirmed its dedication to the successful operation of the plant and stated they are working to minimize any potential disruptions. The delay's potential impact on Hyundai's EV production timeline and eligibility for IRA tax credits remains a concern, but the companies are focused on resolving the construction issues and commencing operations as soon as possible.
