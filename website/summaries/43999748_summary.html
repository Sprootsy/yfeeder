<h2>Summary</h2>
The article discusses how to determine if a year is a leap year using a concise algorithm that can be implemented in just three instructions. It highlights the traditional rules for leap year calculation: a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, unless it is also divisible by 100 but not by 400. The author provides a bitwise operation-based method to perform the leap year check, demonstrating its efficiency and compactness. The method involves integer division and modulo operations, which can be optimized using bitwise operations on certain architectures, allowing for faster execution. The article is of interest to programmers who want to optimize leap year calculations, particularly in performance-critical applications.
