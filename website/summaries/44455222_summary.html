<h2>Summary:</h2>
The article discusses the "Peasant Railgun" in Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, a theoretical exploit of game mechanics allowing players to move objects or creatures at incredibly high speeds over vast distances, effectively turning peasants into a weapon. The core concept involves a line of peasants positioned closely together, passing an object (or creature) down the line using the Ready action to throw. Each peasant readies an action to throw the object as soon as they see the previous peasant throw it. Because the Ready action doesn't specify a minimum range, the distance can be very short. By using the rules for thrown objects and readying actions, the object can be moved down the line at an extreme velocity. The final peasant in the line then launches the object towards a target.

The article highlights the somewhat convoluted and unrealistic nature of this tactic. It requires a large number of cooperative peasants, perfect timing, and a Dungeon Master willing to allow such a literal interpretation of the rules. The effectiveness of the Peasant Railgun is debatable, as a DM could easily rule against it based on common sense, physics, or the spirit of the game. Also, the article mentions that there are variant rules for throwing objects that DMs may use to alter the distance that one can throw an object.

The author also considers whether this maneuver is actually feasible within the rules and points out the problems with it. The main point is that this maneuver relies on the ready action, which states that the specified trigger must be something that the character can perceive and that must occur before the character's next turn. Because of this, the line of peasants must be within the eyesight of each other. Also, the article points out the possible rulings that a DM can make regarding the railgun. Rulings may include the use of common sense, the use of variant rules, or rule that the railgun is not possible.

Ultimately, the Peasant Railgun is more of a thought experiment and a humorous example of how players can try to exploit the rules than a practical strategy. It serves as a reminder that D&D involves interpretation and that the DM has the final say on what is allowed in their game.
