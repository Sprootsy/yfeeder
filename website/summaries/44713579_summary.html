<h2>Summary of Interstellar Comet 3I/Borisov</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object detected passing through our solar system, the first being 'Oumuamua. Discovered in August 2019 by amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov, 3I/Borisov offered astronomers a much clearer and more prolonged look at an object originating from outside our solar system than 'Oumuamua did. Unlike 'Oumuamua, which was small, dark, and oddly shaped, 3I/Borisov behaved much more like a typical comet from our solar system, exhibiting a coma and tail as it approached the Sun.</p>

<p>Its interstellar origin was confirmed by its highly hyperbolic orbit, indicating that it was not gravitationally bound to the Sun and had a significant excess velocity. This trajectory allowed astronomers a unique opportunity to study the composition and characteristics of a celestial object formed in another star system.</p>

<p>Observations revealed that 3I/Borisov had a reddish hue, similar to many comets in our own solar system. Spectroscopic analysis showed the presence of water ice, carbon monoxide, and other molecules commonly found in comets. Notably, the comet's composition appeared remarkably similar to comets found within our solar system, suggesting that the building blocks of comets may be universal across different star systems.</p>

<p>As 3I/Borisov approached perihelion (its closest approach to the Sun) in December 2019, it brightened considerably, allowing for detailed observations with powerful telescopes. Astronomers were able to study the comet's coma, tail, and nucleus, gaining insights into its size, rotation, and the rate at which it shed material.</p>

<p>The breakup of 3I/Borisov occurred after its closest approach to the sun. Several factors may have caused this, including thermal stress from solar radiation and the comet's own rotation.</p>

<p>3I/Borisov's visit provided valuable data for understanding the formation and evolution of planetary systems beyond our own. Its relatively "normal" cometary characteristics suggest that the processes that form comets may be similar across different star systems, challenging some previous assumptions based on the unique properties of 'Oumuamua. The investigation of 3I/Borisov advanced knowledge of the diversity and commonalities among planetary systems throughout the galaxy.</p>
