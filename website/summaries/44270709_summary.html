   Phil McKinney recounts his experiences as Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of HP's Personal Systems Group (PSG) and his role in convincing HP's board to acquire Palm in 2010. The article details the strategic rationale behind the acquisition, focusing on the need for HP to have its own mobile operating system to compete effectively in the rapidly evolving mobile market dominated by Apple's iOS and Google's Android.

   McKinney explains that HP recognized the shift towards a mobile-centric future where smartphones and tablets would become increasingly important. He describes HP's previous attempts to create a competitive mobile platform, including its partnership with Microsoft on Windows Mobile, which proved unsatisfactory. The limitations and strategic control exerted by Microsoft pushed HP to seek an alternative solution.

   Palm, with its webOS operating system, presented itself as a promising candidate. WebOS was praised for its innovative features, such as multitasking, over-the-air updates, and a developer-friendly environment. McKinney and his team saw webOS as a platform that could differentiate HP's mobile devices and provide a superior user experience.

   The article outlines the process of evaluating Palm and webOS, including technical assessments and market analysis. McKinney emphasizes the importance of webOS's architecture and its potential to be adapted for use in various devices, including smartphones, tablets, and even printers. He discusses the challenges of integrating webOS into HP's existing ecosystem and the need to overcome internal resistance to adopting a new operating system.

   McKinney recounts his presentation to HP's board of directors, where he argued for the strategic importance of acquiring Palm. He highlighted the potential of webOS to drive innovation and create a competitive advantage for HP in the mobile market. He addressed concerns about the acquisition cost and the risks associated with integrating a new platform.

   Despite initial skepticism, McKinney successfully convinced the board to approve the acquisition of Palm for $1.2 billion. He attributes his success to a combination of factors, including a clear strategic vision, a thorough understanding of the mobile market, and a compelling presentation that addressed the board's concerns.

   The article concludes by briefly touching on the aftermath of the acquisition, including HP's subsequent decisions regarding webOS, which ultimately led to its demise. While the acquisition of Palm did not achieve its intended outcome, McKinney defends the strategic rationale behind the decision, arguing that it was a necessary step for HP to remain competitive in the mobile market.
