  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
   The article "Node.js in 2025" by Kashwin explores the potential future of Node.js, focusing on key areas of development and challenges the platform might face in the coming years. It discusses several aspects, including the core runtime, the ecosystem, security, alternative runtimes, and the influence of AI.
  </p>
  <p>
   Regarding the core runtime, the author anticipates continued performance improvements through advancements in the V8 JavaScript engine and the potential introduction of new features. The article also touches on the ongoing debate between CommonJS and ES modules and suggests that ES modules will likely become the standard, although CommonJS will persist for the foreseeable future due to its widespread use in existing packages. The author also thinks that the adoption of WASM will increase, and that it will be used more and more with Node.js.
  </p>
  <p>
   The ecosystem section delves into the evolution of package management, highlighting the dominance of npm and the rise of alternative package managers like pnpm and Yarn. The author predicts that while npm will remain a significant player, other package managers offering improved performance and dependency management will gain more traction. The article also discusses the potential for a more standardized module system to reduce fragmentation and improve interoperability.
  </p>
  <p>
   Security is identified as a critical concern, with the article emphasizing the need for better tools and practices to address vulnerabilities in Node.js applications and dependencies. The author suggests that automated security scanning and improved vulnerability reporting will become increasingly important. Supply chain security is also brought up as something that needs to be improved.
  </p>
  <p>
   The rise of alternative JavaScript runtimes like Deno and Bun is acknowledged, with the author examining their potential impact on Node.js. While these runtimes offer certain advantages, the article suggests that Node.js will likely adapt and incorporate some of their innovations to remain competitive. The author believes Node.js will continue to be relevant because of its huge ecosystem.
  </p>
  <p>
   The integration of AI and machine learning into Node.js development is also explored. The author envisions AI tools assisting with code generation, testing, and debugging, potentially streamlining the development process and improving code quality.
  </p>
  <p>
   Overall, the article paints a picture of a Node.js ecosystem that is evolving to address existing challenges and embrace new technologies. While Node.js may face competition from alternative runtimes and require ongoing efforts to improve security, the author suggests that its large community, extensive ecosystem, and adaptability will ensure its continued relevance in the JavaScript landscape.
