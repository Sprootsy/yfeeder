<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
New research from Binghamton University, State University of New York, has found that the pattern of finger wrinkles caused by prolonged water exposure is consistent and unique to each individual, similar to a fingerprint. The study, led by Changhong Wu, assistant professor of biomedical engineering, suggests that these wrinkle patterns could potentially be used as a biometric identifier. The research team developed an automated algorithm to map and compare finger wrinkle patterns after subjects soaked their hands in water for 30 minutes. The algorithm successfully matched wrinkle patterns from the same fingers with high accuracy. This consistency and uniqueness of wrinkle patterns could open doors for new biometric identification methods, especially in situations where traditional fingerprinting is challenging, such as identifying individuals who work extensively with their hands or in wet environments.
