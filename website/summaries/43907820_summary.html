    <h2>Matt Godbolt sold me on Rust by showing me C&#43;&#43;</h2>

<p>The article is a blog post by Christine Dodrill on Collabora, detailing her journey to understanding and appreciating the Rust programming language. Initially skeptical due to her experience with other languages and a perceived lack of immediate need, she was eventually convinced of Rust's merits by Matt Godbolt's compelling presentation. Godbolt demonstrated how Rust's design prevents common pitfalls and undefined behaviors prevalent in C++, using concrete examples that highlighted Rust's memory safety and ownership model. He showed instances where C++ code, despite appearing correct, could lead to vulnerabilities or crashes due to issues like use-after-free, data races, and iterator invalidation. Godbolt then presented the equivalent Rust code, which either prevented these issues at compile time or handled them safely at runtime, without incurring significant performance overhead.

Dodrill was particularly impressed by Rust's ability to catch errors related to memory management and concurrency, areas where C++ often requires meticulous manual effort and can still be prone to mistakes. She notes that while C++ can achieve similar levels of safety through careful coding practices and the use of tools like static analyzers, Rust bakes these safeguards directly into the language. This inherent safety, enforced by the compiler, reduces the burden on the programmer and minimizes the risk of introducing bugs.

The article also touches on Rust's ownership system, which ensures that each piece of data has a single owner at any given time. This system, along with Rust's borrow checker, prevents data races and other concurrency issues by enforcing strict rules about how data can be accessed and modified. Dodrill found this aspect of Rust particularly appealing, as it allows developers to write concurrent code with greater confidence.

While acknowledging that Rust has a steeper learning curve compared to some other languages, Dodrill concludes that the benefits of its safety features outweigh the initial investment. She highlights that Rust's ability to prevent common classes of errors can save significant time and effort in the long run, especially in projects where reliability and security are paramount. Godbolt's demonstration effectively showcased Rust as a superior alternative to C++ in scenarios where memory safety and concurrency are critical concerns. The article essentially serves as a testament to the power of practical demonstration in changing perceptions and convincing skeptics about the value of a new technology.
