   The world's largest operational sand battery, located in Finland, has been activated, showcasing promising economics for seasonal heat storage. Developed by Polar Night Energy, the battery stores heat generated from relatively inexpensive electricity and releases it to heat buildings during colder periods. This technology addresses the intermittency challenges of renewable energy sources like solar and wind, providing a buffer against energy price fluctuations and supply disruptions. The sand battery operates by heating sand to temperatures between 500 and 600 degrees Celsius using resistive heating. The sand is contained within a large, insulated steel container. It then discharges the heat by circulating air through the hot sand, which can then be used in district heating systems or for other industrial processes.

   The article highlights the potential of this technology to significantly reduce reliance on fossil fuels for heating and to stabilize energy grids. The specific installation in Finland is connected to the district heating network in the town of Pornainen, illustrating a practical application. The battery has a storage capacity of 8 MWh and a heating power of 1 MW.

   One of the critical advantages of the sand battery is its use of sand as a storage medium. Sand is a readily available, inexpensive, and stable material, reducing the environmental impact and cost associated with other battery technologies that rely on scarce materials. The longevity of the sand battery is also notable, with minimal degradation expected over decades of use.

   The economic viability of sand batteries depends on factors such as electricity prices, heating demand, and the availability of waste heat sources. According to the article, the economics are becoming increasingly attractive as renewable energy becomes more prevalent and energy prices continue to rise.
