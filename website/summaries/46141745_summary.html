  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    The article presents a brief history of the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol, highlighting its significance in transforming Internet security. It begins by establishing the context of the pre-ACME era, characterized by the complexities, costs, and manual processes involved in obtaining and managing SSL/TLS certificates. This created barriers to widespread HTTPS adoption, hindering the goal of a more secure web.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article introduces ACME as a solution developed by the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG), the organization behind Let's Encrypt. It emphasizes ACME's core function: automating the process of certificate issuance and renewal. This automation eliminates the need for manual interactions with Certificate Authorities (CAs), significantly reducing the cost and complexity associated with certificate management.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article traces the development of ACME, from its initial proposal to its standardization as RFC 8555. It highlights the key design principles that guided its creation, including security, simplicity, and extensibility. Security was paramount, ensuring that only authorized domain owners could obtain certificates. Simplicity aimed to make the protocol easy to implement and use. Extensibility allowed for future additions and adaptations to meet evolving needs.
  </p>

    The impact of ACME and Let's Encrypt on the Internet is then discussed. The article emphasizes that ACME made HTTPS more accessible to everyone, especially smaller websites and individuals who previously lacked the resources to acquire and maintain certificates. This led to a dramatic increase in HTTPS adoption across the web, improving user privacy and security.

    Furthermore, the article mentions the technical aspects of the ACME protocol, briefly explaining the challenge-response mechanism used to verify domain ownership. This involves the CA presenting a challenge that the applicant must solve by either placing a specific file on their web server or configuring a DNS record. Successful completion of the challenge proves control over the domain, allowing the CA to issue a certificate.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article concludes by reiterating ACME's lasting contribution to a more secure Internet. It emphasizes that by automating certificate management, ACME has removed significant barriers to HTTPS adoption, making the web a safer place for everyone. It also points towards the ongoing evolution of the protocol and its continued relevance in the ever-changing landscape of Internet security.
