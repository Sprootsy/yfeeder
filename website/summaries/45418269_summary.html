<p>Joan Westenberg's article reflects on the career of Kurt Vonnegut, emphasizing that his breakthrough success with "Slaughterhouse-Five" didn't arrive until he was 47 years old. The author uses Vonnegut's late success as a counterpoint to the pervasive societal pressure for early achievement, particularly in creative fields. She reflects on her own anxieties and compares them to those around her in the tech and startup industries. The article argues that it's crucial to remember that impactful work can emerge later in life and that judging oneself against the perceived timelines of others is often counterproductive.</p>

<p>Westenberg acknowledges the societal narrative that often equates youth with innovation and relevance, especially in fields like technology. She highlights how this narrative can lead to feelings of inadequacy and fear of being "left behind" for individuals who haven't achieved significant milestones by a certain age. She shares her personal experiences of feeling anxious about her creative work not gaining immediate recognition, drawing parallels to the pressures faced by many in the creative and entrepreneurial worlds.</p>

<p>The author uses Vonnegut's story as a reminder that creative success and significant impact can happen at any stage of life. "Slaughterhouse-Five", now considered a seminal work, only came about after Vonnegut had already lived through many life experiences, including serving in World War II and working various jobs. She reminds the reader that he had also previously written several books which had not achieved the same level of fame.</p>

<p>Westenberg delves into the concept of 'cultural canon' and notes the pressure to conform to existing expectations of how artists should create and conduct themselves. She advocates for ignoring these established norms and concentrating on producing genuine, meaningful work. The value of patience, persistence, and resilience in the creative process is underlined.</p>

<p>The author makes a larger comment on capitalism, tying its impact to feelings of worth and success. She argues that the capitalist focus on productivity and external validation can distort one's perception of their own value and accomplishments. She suggests that true creativity stems from inner motivation rather than a desire for commercial success or external praise, and suggests that a person's creative pursuit can be of great value even if it does not receive external validation.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Westenberg's piece is a call to resist the pressures of timelines and external validation, particularly in creative pursuits. She encourages readers to embrace their own unique journeys, to focus on creating meaningful work, and to find value in the process itself, regardless of when or if it leads to widespread recognition.</p>
