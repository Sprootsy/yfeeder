  <p><b>Summary:</b><br>
  The article "How to fix peer review: Researchers are testing radical ways to vet scientific work" discusses ongoing efforts to reform the peer review process in scientific publishing. Recognizing that traditional peer review can be slow, biased, and burdensome, researchers and publishers are experimenting with various alternative approaches. These include preprint reviews, where articles are reviewed before publication on preprint servers; portable peer review, where reviews are transferred between journals; registered reports, where study design is peer-reviewed before data collection; and open peer review, where reviewer and author identities are disclosed, and reviews are published alongside the article. The article highlights the potential benefits and challenges of each approach. Preprint reviews can accelerate the dissemination of research findings and provide early feedback, but concerns exist about the quality and reliability of these reviews. Portable peer review aims to reduce redundancy and speed up the publication process, but it requires coordination and trust between journals. Registered reports promote methodological rigor and reduce publication bias, but they may not be suitable for all types of research. Open peer review can increase transparency and accountability, but it may discourage reviewers from providing critical feedback. The article emphasizes that no single approach is a perfect solution and that the best approach may vary depending on the field and the specific research question. It concludes that continued experimentation and evaluation are needed to improve the peer review process and ensure the quality and integrity of scientific research.</p>
