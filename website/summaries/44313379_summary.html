  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The provided GitHub repository, lunchbox-computer/bento, details a project centered around a portable, modular computer system named "Bento." The Bento system is designed for flexibility and customization, resembling a "lunchbox" form factor with interconnected modules for various functionalities.
  </p>
  <p>
    The core concept of Bento revolves around a backplane, which serves as the central hub for connecting different modules. These modules can include a CPU module (likely based on a Raspberry Pi Compute Module or similar), a display module, input modules (like a keyboard or trackpad), battery and power management modules, and storage modules. The project emphasizes open-source design, allowing users to build, modify, and extend the system to suit their specific needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The repository contains hardware design files (likely in KiCad or similar EDA software), software code (presumably for the system's firmware and potentially user-level applications), and documentation outlining the system's architecture, module specifications, and build instructions. The project also highlights the potential use cases for Bento, such as a portable workstation, a field-deployable development platform, or a customized embedded system.
  </p>
  <p>
    A key aspect of the Bento project is its modularity. This allows users to easily swap out or upgrade individual components without affecting the entire system. For example, a user could upgrade to a more powerful CPU module, add a larger battery, or integrate a specialized sensor module. This modularity also facilitates repair and maintenance, as faulty modules can be easily replaced.
  </p>
  <p>
    The open-source nature of the project encourages community contributions. Users are encouraged to contribute their own module designs, software enhancements, and documentation improvements. This collaborative approach fosters innovation and ensures that the Bento system remains adaptable to evolving needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The documentation within the repository likely covers various aspects of the Bento system, including the backplane design, module interface specifications, power management considerations, and software development guidelines. It may also include example projects and tutorials to help users get started with building and customizing their own Bento systems.
