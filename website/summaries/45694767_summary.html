<p>Asahi Linux has announced an update to m1n1, the low-level hypervisor/bootloader used to boot Linux on Apple Silicon Macs. This update brings several key improvements and new features. One major change is the introduction of a device tree overlay system, allowing for more flexible hardware configurations and easier adaptation to different Apple Silicon models. This system avoids the need to modify the base device tree, simplifying the process of enabling new hardware features or accommodating variations in existing hardware.</p>

<p>The update also includes initial support for the Secure Enclave Processor (SEP) on M3 series chips. While full functionality is still under development, this marks an important step towards enabling features that rely on the SEP, such as secure storage and cryptographic operations. The developers have also been working on USB support, specifically focusing on USB-C and USB4. This involves reverse-engineering the Apple Silicon USB controller and developing the necessary drivers to enable USB functionality in the Linux environment. Significant progress has been made in this area, with the developers reporting successful enumeration of USB devices and data transfer.</p>

<p>In addition to these major features, the m1n1 update includes various bug fixes, performance improvements, and code refactoring. These changes contribute to a more stable and efficient boot process, as well as a more maintainable codebase for future development. The Asahi Linux team continues to make progress in their efforts to bring a fully functional Linux distribution to Apple Silicon Macs, and this m1n1 update is a significant step forward in that direction.</p>
