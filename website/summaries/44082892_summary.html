  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The Financial Times article discusses the challenges faced by private equity firms in the current economic environment.  Rising interest rates and inflation are making it more difficult to finance deals and increase the value of portfolio companies.  Deal volume has decreased and the ability to achieve high returns through financial engineering, such as leveraging companies with cheap debt, is diminishing.  The article highlights how the era of easy money, which fueled private equity's growth for over a decade, is coming to an end, forcing firms to adapt their strategies. They are now having to focus on operational improvements and revenue growth at their portfolio companies, rather than relying solely on financial leverage. The piece also explores the impact of these changes on fundraising, deal valuations, and the overall private equity landscape.</p>
