    The article "Why English Doesn't Use Accents" from the Dead Language Society explores the historical and sociolinguistic reasons behind the English language's general lack of diacritics (accents) compared to many other languages, particularly those in the Romance family. It argues that while Old English did feature some accented letters, a combination of factors led to their eventual disappearance.

    One primary reason cited is the impact of the Norman Conquest in 1066. The influx of Norman French speakers and scribes introduced new spelling conventions and vocabulary, disrupting the established Old English writing system. While some Norman scribes initially attempted to incorporate existing English letters with diacritics, the overall effect was a simplification and standardization of spelling, gradually eroding the use of accents.

    The article also points to the role of the printing press in the 15th century. Early English printers, often from continental Europe, faced practical difficulties in reproducing less common accented letters with their available typefaces. This led to a further simplification of spelling and a preference for letters readily available in their printing sets. The prioritization of efficient printing over preserving diacritics solidified their decline.

    Furthermore, the author argues that the phonetic diversity of English dialects played a part. As English spread geographically and developed various regional pronunciations, a standardized written form became more desirable. Accents, which often reflect specific pronunciations, might have been seen as limiting or favoring certain dialects over others. The move towards a more generalized spelling system helped to accommodate this diversity.

    The article contrasts English with languages like French and Spanish, where accents are crucial for distinguishing between words and indicating pronunciation. It suggests that the loss of accents in English was not necessarily a sign of linguistic decay but rather a consequence of historical circumstances, technological advancements, and the evolving needs of a diverse and expanding language community. The author also mentions that English does sometimes use diacritics in loanwords (words borrowed from other languages) but often these are dropped over time.

    In essence, the article presents a multifaceted explanation for the absence of widespread accent usage in modern English, attributing it to a combination of historical events, technological limitations, and sociolinguistic pressures. It argues that the evolution of English spelling has been shaped by practical considerations and the need to accommodate a wide range of dialects, ultimately leading to a relatively accent-free writing system.
