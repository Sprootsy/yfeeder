        <h1>Office is too slow, so Microsoft is making it load at Windows startup</h1>
        <p>
<div>
<p>Microsoft is working on a solution to improve the launch time of its Office suite. The approach involves pre-loading parts of Office during Windows startup, similar to how other applications like Steam and Adobe Creative Cloud handle updates and pre-loading components. The aim is to make Office applications launch almost instantly, minimizing user wait times. While details are scarce, the implication is that essential Office components would be loaded into memory at startup, allowing for faster application loading when the user actually launches Word, Excel, or other Office apps. This change addresses a common user complaint about the sluggishness of Office applications, especially on older or less powerful hardware. The article suggests this optimization could significantly improve the user experience by reducing perceived delays and streamlining workflows.</p>
