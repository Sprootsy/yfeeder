  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The provided webpage from the Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) Health Physics Museum describes early pacemakers that were powered by radioactive materials, specifically plutonium-238. These pacemakers were developed due to the limitations of the batteries available at the time, which had short lifespans and required frequent replacement surgeries. Radioisotope-powered pacemakers offered a longer lifespan, potentially lasting for ten years or more, thus reducing the need for repeated surgeries.</p>
  <p>The page details the engineering and physical characteristics of a specific model, the Medtronic-Laurens-Alcatel Model 9000 radioisotope-powered pacemaker. It explains that the plutonium-238 fuel was encapsulated in multiple layers of protective materials to prevent leakage and ensure patient safety. The device operated using a thermoelectric converter, which converted the heat generated by the radioactive decay of plutonium-238 into electricity. This electricity then stimulated the heart muscle, regulating the heart rate.</p>
  <p>The text also addresses the safety concerns associated with using radioactive materials in medical devices. It emphasizes the rigorous testing and safety measures implemented to minimize the risk of radiation exposure and prevent the release of plutonium-238 into the environment, even in the event of accidents like cremation or burial. The design included features to withstand high temperatures and pressures.</p>
  <p>The article also mentions that while radioisotope-powered pacemakers were a significant advancement at the time, they were eventually replaced by lithium-ion battery-powered pacemakers, which offered comparable lifespans without the risks associated with radioactive materials. The webpage serves as a historical record of this technology and highlights the considerations involved in using radioactive materials in medical applications.</p>
