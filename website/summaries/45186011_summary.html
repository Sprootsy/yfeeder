<p>Dropbox Paper, a collaborative document editing tool, is discontinuing its mobile app on both iOS and Android platforms. Starting September 1, 2023, users will no longer be able to access Paper through the mobile apps. Dropbox is focusing its resources on improving core Dropbox features and workflows, including document editing capabilities directly within Dropbox. Users are encouraged to use the Dropbox mobile app or the web version of Paper for continued access to their documents. All Paper documents will remain accessible through these alternative methods. The mobile apps will be removed from the app stores on October 1, 2023. Users who only use Paper on mobile will need to use the web version of Paper or the Dropbox mobile app to access the Paper folder in their Dropbox account. No Paper documents will be deleted as part of this change.</p>
