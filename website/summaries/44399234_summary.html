    <h2>SymbolicAI: A neuro-symbolic perspective on LLMs</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <p>The provided text is a GitHub repository description for SymbolicAI, an initiative by ExtensityAI focused on integrating symbolic reasoning with modern AI techniques like deep learning. The project aims to address the limitations of current AI systems, particularly their lack of interpretability, robustness, and generalization capabilities. SymbolicAI seeks to create AI systems that can reason, plan, and learn in a more human-like manner by combining the strengths of symbolic AI (logic, knowledge representation, reasoning) and neural networks (pattern recognition, learning from data). The repository likely contains code, datasets, documentation, and research papers related to this effort.</p>
