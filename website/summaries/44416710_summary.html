  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>
   A new report by Marine Change, using data from Global Fishing Watch, reveals that China is responsible for 44% of the world's visible fishing effort, dwarfing all other nations. The study analyzed the activity of fishing vessels larger than 24 meters, which are visible via satellite. This report highlights the disproportionate impact of China's distant-water fishing fleet on global fisheries. Following China, Taiwan accounts for approximately 7% of visible fishing, and Japan is third with around 3%. The United States ranks ninth, accounting for just over 1% of the total visible fishing activity. The assessment also indicates significant fishing activity within the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of other countries, particularly in West Africa and South America. The visible fishing effort correlates with regions known for overfishing and illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Oceana is urging for greater transparency and regulation in the fishing industry to combat overfishing and protect marine ecosystems.
