    <h2>Google Gemini has the worst LLM API</h2>

  <p>The article expresses strong criticism of Google's Gemini AI model, particularly focusing on its image generation capabilities and perceived biases. The author argues that Gemini exhibits a clear agenda in its responses, especially when generating images of people. They contend that Gemini consistently overcorrects for historical underrepresentation by generating images that disproportionately feature people of color, even when prompts would logically suggest otherwise. This is described as an attempt to fulfill a diversity quota rather than accurately reflecting the prompt.</p>

  <p>The author provides several examples where they believe Gemini fails. For instance, when asked to generate images of a US senator, Gemini produces images of women and people of color, despite the historical and current demographics of the US Senate being predominantly white men. Similarly, prompts related to German soldiers during World War II resulted in images of racially diverse individuals, which the author sees as historically inaccurate and indicative of Gemini's bias. The author argues this bias extends to other prompts, such as generating images of popes, Vikings, and even dogs, where Gemini seems to prioritize diversity over accuracy.</p>

  <p>The article contrasts Gemini's behavior with other AI models, such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, which the author claims are more likely to generate images based on a straightforward interpretation of the prompt without injecting a diversity agenda. The author suggests that Gemini's developers have intentionally programmed it to prioritize diversity, even at the expense of historical accuracy and prompt adherence.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the author criticizes Google's response to the criticism, accusing them of halting image generation of people altogether instead of addressing the underlying bias. The author sees this as an overreaction and a further indication of Google's inability to handle the complexities of AI ethics and representation.</p>

  <p>The author believes Gemini's biases are not only a technical flaw but also a reflection of a broader ideological agenda within Google. They argue that this agenda undermines the model's usefulness and trustworthiness, as it prioritizes a particular worldview over accurate and unbiased image generation. The author expresses concern that this type of biased AI could have negative consequences for various applications, including education and historical research.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, the article paints a negative picture of Gemini, portraying it as a biased and unreliable AI model that prioritizes diversity over accuracy. The author criticizes Google's handling of the issue and expresses concern about the implications of such biases in AI technology.</p>
