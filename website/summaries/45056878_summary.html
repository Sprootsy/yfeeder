    <h2>You no longer need JavaScript: an overview of what makes modern CSS so awesome</h2>

   <h3>Summary:</h3>
   <p>
     The article "You Don't Need JS" argues that many websites unnecessarily rely on JavaScript for functionality that could be achieved using native HTML and CSS features. The author contends that the trend of adding JavaScript to solve problems that HTML and CSS can handle leads to bloated websites, accessibility issues, and a degraded user experience for those with JavaScript disabled or using older devices.
   </p>
   <p>
     The author begins by acknowledging the usefulness of JavaScript for complex web applications, but points out that the majority of websites do not fall into this category. Many websites are primarily content-focused, such as blogs, documentation sites, or marketing pages. For these types of sites, JavaScript is often used to add features that could be implemented using HTML and CSS alone.
   </p>
   <p>
     The article then provides several examples of common website features that can be achieved without JavaScript. These include:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>
       <strong>Navigation menus:</strong> CSS can be used to create dropdown menus, hamburger menus, and other navigation elements using the `:hover` and `:checked` pseudo-classes.
     </li>
     <li>
       <strong>Image galleries and carousels:</strong> CSS can be used to create image galleries and carousels using the `scroll-snap` property, avoiding the need for JavaScript libraries.
     </li>
     <li>
       <strong>Form validation:</strong> HTML5 provides built-in form validation attributes like `required`, `type`, and `pattern` that can be used to validate user input without JavaScript.
     </li>
     <li>
       <strong>Lightboxes:</strong> CSS can be used to create lightboxes (modal windows that display images or other content) using the `target` pseudo-class.
     </li>
     <li>
       <strong>Tabs and accordions:</strong> CSS can be used to create tabbed interfaces and accordions using the `:checked` pseudo-class and hidden radio buttons or checkboxes.
     </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
     The author emphasizes that using HTML and CSS for these features offers several advantages:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>
       <strong>Improved performance:</strong> Native HTML and CSS are generally faster and more efficient than JavaScript-based solutions.
     </li>
     <li>
       <strong>Better accessibility:</strong> HTML and CSS are inherently more accessible than JavaScript, especially for users with disabilities or those using assistive technologies.
     </li>
     <li>
       <strong>Reduced complexity:</strong> Avoiding JavaScript simplifies the codebase and reduces the risk of bugs and security vulnerabilities.
     </li>
     <li>
       <strong>Enhanced resilience:</strong> Websites built with HTML and CSS will continue to function even if JavaScript is disabled or fails to load.
     </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
     The article concludes by encouraging developers to carefully consider whether JavaScript is truly necessary for each feature they implement. By embracing the power of HTML and CSS, developers can create faster, more accessible, and more robust websites. The author suggests that developers should treat JavaScript as a progressive enhancement, adding it only when it is truly needed to provide functionality that cannot be achieved with native technologies. This approach leads to a better user experience for everyone.

   <h3>Key Points:</h3>
   <ul>
     <li>Many websites overuse JavaScript for features achievable with HTML and CSS.</li>
     <li>Examples include navigation menus, image galleries, form validation, lightboxes, tabs, and accordions.</li>
     <li>Using HTML and CSS improves performance, accessibility, and resilience.</li>
     <li>Consider JavaScript as a progressive enhancement, not a default solution.</li>
