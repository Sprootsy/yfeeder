  <p>The Google Photos app on Android is getting a new conversational AI editing feature, powered by Gemini models. This feature allows users to refine their photos by simply describing the edits they want to make using natural language. For example, users can say "brighten the image and reduce the shadows" instead of manually adjusting sliders. This feature understands the context of the request and applies the changes accordingly.</p>
  <p>The conversational editing feature is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. It aims to eliminate the complexities of traditional photo editing tools by allowing users to communicate their desired edits in a way that feels natural. The AI model interprets the user's request and automatically applies the necessary adjustments to the photo. This simplifies the editing process and makes it accessible to a wider range of users, regardless of their photo editing experience.</p>
