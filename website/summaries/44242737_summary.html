    <h2>Fine-tuning LLMs is a waste of time</h2>

    The article "Fine-tuning LLMs Is a Huge Waste" by Coding Interviews Made Simple argues against the common practice of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific tasks. The author contends that fine-tuning is often unnecessary and inefficient, particularly when better alternatives exist.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article begins by acknowledging the widespread belief that fine-tuning is essential for tailoring LLMs to particular applications. However, it challenges this assumption by highlighting the drawbacks of fine-tuning. The author points out that fine-tuning requires significant computational resources, a large amount of high-quality training data, and expertise in machine learning. These requirements can be prohibitive for many individuals and organizations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, the article asserts that fine-tuning can lead to overfitting, where the LLM becomes too specialized to the training data and performs poorly on unseen data. This can negate the benefits of fine-tuning and result in a model that is less generalizable. The author emphasizes that obtaining a sufficiently large and representative dataset to avoid overfitting can be a major challenge.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead of fine-tuning, the article advocates for alternative techniques that are often more effective and less resource-intensive. These techniques include prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and using smaller, specialized models.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prompt engineering involves carefully crafting the input prompt to guide the LLM towards the desired output. By providing clear instructions and examples, it's possible to elicit the desired behavior from the LLM without modifying its underlying parameters. The article suggests that prompt engineering can be surprisingly effective, especially with powerful LLMs.
  </p>

    Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combines the strengths of LLMs with external knowledge sources. In RAG, the LLM first retrieves relevant information from a database or knowledge base and then uses this information to generate a response. This allows the LLM to access up-to-date and specific information without needing to be retrained. The author argues that RAG is particularly useful for tasks that require factual accuracy or access to domain-specific knowledge.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article also suggests using smaller, specialized models for specific tasks. These models are trained from scratch on a limited dataset and are designed to excel in a particular area. While they may not be as versatile as LLMs, they can be more efficient and accurate for specific applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    The author does concede that fine-tuning can be useful in certain situations, such as when dealing with highly specialized tasks or when aiming to improve the LLM's style or tone. However, they emphasize that these cases are relatively rare and that the benefits of fine-tuning must be carefully weighed against the costs.
  </p>
  <p>
    In conclusion, the article argues that fine-tuning LLMs is often an overused and inefficient technique. It suggests that prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and smaller, specialized models are often better alternatives. The author encourages readers to carefully consider the costs and benefits of fine-tuning before embarking on this path.
