  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The article is a blog post by Yiding Jiang detailing his exploration and understanding of various machine learning concepts and techniques. The author describes his journey in learning about topics such as linear regression, logistic regression, optimization methods like gradient descent, regularization techniques, and the importance of data preprocessing. He emphasizes a hands-on approach, implementing these algorithms from scratch using Python and libraries like NumPy.
</p>
  <p>
    The blog post begins by introducing the fundamental concepts of linear regression, including the formulation of the model, the cost function (Mean Squared Error), and the use of gradient descent to find the optimal parameters that minimize the cost function. He explains the mathematical foundations and provides Python code snippets to illustrate the implementation. He also talks about the importance of feature scaling (normalization) and its effect on the convergence speed of gradient descent.

    The author then moves on to logistic regression, explaining how it is used for binary classification problems. He discusses the sigmoid function, which maps any real value to a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of belonging to a particular class. Similar to linear regression, he describes the cost function for logistic regression (binary cross-entropy) and applies gradient descent to optimize the model parameters. He also touches upon the concept of decision boundaries and how they are formed by logistic regression.

    The blog post further delves into regularization techniques, specifically L1 and L2 regularization, which are used to prevent overfitting. He explains how these techniques add a penalty term to the cost function, discouraging large parameter values and promoting simpler models. He shows how to implement these regularization methods in the context of both linear and logistic regression.

    The author also emphasizes the importance of data preprocessing, including handling missing values and categorical features. He discusses various methods for dealing with missing data, such as imputation with the mean or median, and explores techniques for encoding categorical variables, like one-hot encoding.
</p>
  <p>
    Throughout the blog post, Yiding Jiang shares his personal experiences and insights gained while learning these concepts. He highlights the challenges he faced, the mistakes he made, and the lessons he learned along the way. He advocates for a practical, hands-on approach to learning machine learning, encouraging readers to implement the algorithms themselves to gain a deeper understanding.

  <p>
    Finally, the blog post serves as a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn the fundamentals of machine learning. It provides clear explanations, code examples, and practical advice, making it accessible to beginners while still offering valuable insights for more experienced practitioners. The author's enthusiasm and dedication to learning are evident throughout the post, inspiring readers to embark on their own machine learning journeys.
