<p>Denmark is planning a migration to open-source software, specifically Linux, across its public sector. This initiative aims to reduce the country's dependence on proprietary software and cut costs. The transition will involve replacing Windows with a Linux-based operating system and Microsoft Office with open-source alternatives. This move is not just about cost savings; it's also about enhancing the country's digital sovereignty and ensuring greater control over its IT infrastructure. The decision follows extensive research and pilot programs that demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of using open-source solutions. The transition is expected to take several years, with a phased approach to minimize disruption. The Danish government is also investing in training programs to equip public sector employees with the necessary skills to use Linux and other open-source software. The move is seen as a strategic investment in the country's technological future, with the potential to stimulate local innovation and create new opportunities for Danish IT companies. The initiative has received support from both government officials and the open-source community. However, there are also concerns about the challenges of migrating from a well-established Windows environment to a new operating system. These challenges include ensuring compatibility with existing systems and applications, addressing security concerns, and providing ongoing support and maintenance. Despite these challenges, the Danish government is committed to the transition and believes that the long-term benefits outweigh the risks. The move to Linux is part of a broader trend towards open-source software in the public sector, with other countries also exploring similar initiatives. The Danish experience could serve as a model for other governments looking to reduce costs, enhance digital sovereignty, and promote innovation through open-source technologies.</p>
