<p>The CachyOS team is seeking framework sponsorship to enhance the distribution and accelerate development. CachyOS is an Arch Linux-based distribution known for its performance optimizations, custom package builds, and user-friendly experience. Currently, the team primarily self-funds the project and relies on community contributions.</p>

<p>The sponsorship will be used to address several key areas:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Infrastructure Costs:</b> CachyOS requires robust infrastructure for package building, hosting repositories, and maintaining the website. Sponsorship would help cover these ongoing expenses, ensuring the stability and availability of the distribution.</li>
<li><b>Development Resources:</b> Funding would enable the team to dedicate more time to development tasks, such as implementing new features, optimizing performance, and addressing bug fixes promptly. This will lead to a more polished and feature-rich user experience.</li>
<li><b>Community Engagement:</b> The team aims to expand community engagement through initiatives like organizing events, creating tutorials, and providing better support channels. Sponsorship would facilitate these efforts, fostering a more vibrant and collaborative community around CachyOS.</li>
<li><b>Hardware and Software:</b> Access to better hardware and software licenses would significantly improve the development workflow. This includes dedicated build servers, testing environments, and professional development tools.</li>
</ol>

<p>The team proposes several sponsorship tiers, each offering different levels of visibility and recognition for sponsors. These tiers may include logo placement on the website, shout-outs on social media, mentions in release notes, and even the opportunity to collaborate on specific features.</p>

<p>By securing framework sponsorship, CachyOS aims to solidify its position as a leading Arch-based distribution, providing a fast, stable, and user-friendly experience for its users while also fostering a strong and supportive community.</p>
