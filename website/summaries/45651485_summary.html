  <p>According to an article published on TechCrunch on October 18, 2025, Wikipedia is experiencing a decline in traffic. The Wikimedia Foundation attributes this drop to several factors, primarily the rise of AI-driven search summaries and the increasing popularity of social video platforms. These trends are changing how people seek and consume information, impacting Wikipedia's role as a primary source of knowledge.</p>
  
  <p>The article elaborates on how AI search summaries, provided by search engines, offer users direct answers and concise information snippets at the top of search results. This reduces the need for users to click through to websites like Wikipedia to find the information they seek. Instead of navigating to Wikipedia for background information, definitions, or explanations, users can get immediate answers directly from the search interface.</p>

  <p>The rise of social video is another significant factor. Platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and others have become increasingly popular sources of information, particularly for younger audiences. Short, engaging video content can provide information in a more digestible and entertaining format than traditional text-based articles. This shift in consumption patterns means that people are turning to video platforms for quick explanations, educational content, and overviews of various topics, further drawing traffic away from Wikipedia.</p>
  
  <p>The Wikimedia Foundation is reportedly exploring various strategies to address this decline in traffic. These include improving Wikipedia's mobile experience, experimenting with new content formats (potentially including video), and collaborating with AI developers to ensure that Wikipedia content is accurately and fairly represented in AI-generated summaries. They are also considering ways to better integrate Wikipedia with social media platforms to reach new audiences.</p>

  <p>The article suggests that Wikipedia's challenge reflects a broader shift in the information landscape, where users increasingly expect immediate, easily digestible content. To remain relevant, Wikipedia must adapt to these changing user behaviors and find new ways to deliver knowledge in a way that meets the demands of the modern information consumer. This includes understanding how AI and social video are shaping information consumption and proactively developing strategies to maintain its position as a vital resource for information and knowledge.</p>
