<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>According to an internal protocol obtained by netzpolitik.org, Denmark is actively pushing for the implementation of chat control within the European Union. The document reveals that the Danish government aims to advance the controversial measure, which involves scanning private communications for illegal content, despite significant criticism and concerns about its potential impact on privacy and security. The protocol outlines Denmark's strategy to build alliances with other member states and influence the ongoing negotiations on the EU's proposed regulation on detecting, removing, and reporting illegal content online. The Danish government believes that chat control is a necessary tool to combat child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and other forms of online crime. However, critics argue that such measures could lead to mass surveillance, false positives, and the erosion of fundamental rights.</p>
<p>The protocol details Denmark's efforts to address concerns raised by other member states and civil society organizations. These include exploring technical solutions to minimize the risk of errors and ensuring judicial oversight of the scanning process. Despite these efforts, significant disagreements remain among member states regarding the scope and implementation of chat control. Some countries, like Germany, have expressed strong reservations about the proposal, citing concerns about its compatibility with fundamental rights and data protection laws. The leaked protocol provides valuable insights into the internal debates and political maneuvering surrounding this contentious issue.</p>
