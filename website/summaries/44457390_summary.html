<p>Google is open-sourcing its zero-knowledge (ZK) proof technology to enhance online privacy, particularly in age assurance. ZK proofs allow verifying information without revealing the data itself, enabling users to prove their age or other attributes without disclosing their actual birthdate or specific details. This technology addresses the growing need for privacy-preserving age verification in various online contexts, such as accessing age-restricted content or complying with regulations like the Digital Services Act (DSA) in Europe. Google's open-source ZK proof toolkit includes pre-built circuits for common age ranges, making it easier for developers to implement age assurance features in their applications and services. By open-sourcing this technology, Google aims to promote wider adoption of privacy-preserving age verification methods and contribute to a safer and more private online experience for users.</p>
