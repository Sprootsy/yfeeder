   The article "The Many, Many, Many JavaScript Runtimes of the Last Decade" by Jamie explores the proliferation of JavaScript runtimes beyond the browser, particularly over the past decade. It delves into the historical context, starting with Node.js as a pivotal moment that allowed JavaScript to execute on the server-side, enabling full-stack JavaScript development.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article describes the initial excitement and widespread adoption of Node.js, highlighting its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model as a key factor in its popularity. However, it also discusses the limitations and challenges that Node.js presented, such as its reliance on npm and the complexities of managing dependencies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The author then transitions into the emergence of alternative JavaScript runtimes, often created to address specific shortcomings or to explore new paradigms. This includes io.js, a fork of Node.js that emerged due to governance disagreements within the Node.js project, which eventually merged back.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article further discusses other notable runtimes like Deno, created by Ryan Dahl (the original creator of Node.js) to address design flaws he perceived in Node.js, such as security issues, reliance on npm, and the module system. Deno embraced TypeScript as a first-class citizen and aimed for improved security through permissions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article also touches upon Bun, a more recent entrant that aims for speed and compatibility with existing Node.js packages. Bun is written in Zig and uses JavaScriptCore as its engine, promising significant performance improvements.
  </p>
  <p>
   Additionally, the article acknowledges the existence of other JavaScript runtimes, like those embedded in application platforms such as Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions, and others, as well as more niche or experimental runtimes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The central theme is that the JavaScript runtime landscape has become incredibly diverse. While Node.js remains a dominant force, the emergence of alternatives reflects ongoing experimentation, innovation, and attempts to optimize for different use cases and address perceived weaknesses. The author suggests this proliferation indicates a healthy ecosystem with developers actively seeking better tools and approaches.
