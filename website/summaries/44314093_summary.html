<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. State Department has updated its guidance for international students applying for visas, requiring them to ensure their social media accounts are set to public. This policy is designed to enhance national security by allowing consular officers to review applicants' online activity. The new guidance affects applicants for F-1 and M-1 visas, which are for academic and vocational studies, respectively. While applicants are not explicitly required to provide their social media handles on the visa application form (DS-160), consular officers may request this information during the interview process if they deem it necessary for identity verification or security vetting. The State Department emphasizes that the review of social media is part of a broader effort to identify potential security threats and ensure that individuals entering the U.S. do not pose a risk. Concerns have been raised about privacy and potential biases in the review process, with critics arguing that the policy could disproportionately affect students from certain countries or those with specific political views. The State Department maintains that the reviews are conducted in accordance with U.S. law and are aimed at protecting national security while respecting privacy and civil liberties.</p>
