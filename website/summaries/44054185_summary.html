<p>The Google AI Studio has been upgraded with native code generation capabilities and support for agentic tools. This upgrade allows developers to build more sophisticated AI-powered applications directly within the platform. The new features aim to streamline the development workflow and enhance the functionality of AI models.</p>

<p>One of the major enhancements is the ability for AI models within Google AI Studio to generate code natively. This means that the models can now produce functional code snippets as part of their output, enabling developers to automate tasks and integrate AI-generated solutions directly into their projects. This code generation capability supports various programming languages, making it versatile for different development needs.</p>

<p>The introduction of agentic tools represents another significant advancement. Agentic tools empower AI models to interact with external APIs and services, allowing them to perform actions and access information beyond their internal knowledge base. This expands the scope of what AI models can achieve, enabling them to handle more complex tasks that require external data or interactions.</p>

<p>The combination of native code generation and agentic tools facilitates the creation of AI agents that can autonomously perform tasks, such as data analysis, report generation, and automated workflows. Developers can define the goals and constraints for these agents, and the AI models will generate the necessary code and interact with external tools to achieve the desired outcomes.</p>

<p>The upgraded Google AI Studio provides a more integrated and powerful environment for building AI-driven applications. It simplifies the process of developing, testing, and deploying AI models, while also opening up new possibilities for creating intelligent systems that can automate tasks and solve complex problems. This upgrade underscores Google's commitment to empowering developers with cutting-edge AI tools and technologies.</p>
