    The article is a blog post by Frans Skarman detailing his experience of writing his PhD thesis in Typst, a new markup-based typesetting system. He explains his motivations for choosing Typst over LaTeX, the common choice for academic writing, and provides a comprehensive overview of his workflow, the challenges he faced, and the solutions he implemented. The post emphasizes the advantages of Typst such as its modern syntax, built-in features (like a package manager), and overall user-friendliness compared to LaTeX.

    Frans begins by explaining his prior experience with LaTeX, highlighting its complexity and the steep learning curve associated with creating custom document styles. He describes how Typst's cleaner syntax, similar to Markdown but with more powerful typesetting capabilities, appealed to him. One significant aspect he appreciates is Typst's built-in package manager, which simplifies the process of including external packages and dependencies in the document. This contrasts sharply with LaTeX, where package management can often be a cumbersome task.

    The author then delves into the specifics of creating a custom Typst template for his thesis. He discusses the modular design of his template, dividing it into separate files for different elements such as the title page, table of contents, bibliography, and chapter styles. This approach allows for easier management and modification of the template. He also addresses the challenge of customizing various aspects of the document's appearance, such as the layout, fonts, and numbering schemes. He makes use of Typst's theming capabilities to define and apply consistent styles throughout the document.

    A considerable portion of the blog post is dedicated to explaining how Frans handled the bibliography and citation management using Zotero and Better BibTeX. He describes his setup for automatically exporting his Zotero library to a BibTeX file, which Typst can then use to generate citations and the bibliography. He demonstrates how he customized the citation styles to meet the specific requirements of his university and field of study. He also explains the use of custom Typst functions to format the bibliography entries according to specific guidelines.

    The author also addresses the challenges he faced in integrating code listings and figures into his thesis. He shows how to use Typst's built-in features for syntax highlighting and code formatting, as well as how to include and caption figures. Furthermore, he discusses how to handle tables and mathematical equations within Typst, explaining the syntax and best practices for creating visually appealing and well-formatted content.

    Frans reflects on the overall experience of using Typst for his thesis, acknowledging both the benefits and drawbacks. He notes that while Typst is still relatively new and lacks some of the mature features and extensive package ecosystem of LaTeX, its ease of use and modern design made it a worthwhile choice for his project. He also provides practical advice and recommendations for other users considering Typst for academic writing, encouraging them to explore its capabilities and contribute to its growing community. He shares his template and resources on GitHub, allowing others to benefit from his work and contribute to the development of Typst templates for academic theses.

    In conclusion, the blog post offers a detailed and informative case study of using Typst for a PhD thesis, providing valuable insights and practical guidance for researchers and students looking for an alternative to LaTeX. It showcases Typst's potential as a modern and user-friendly typesetting system for academic writing, while also acknowledging its current limitations and areas for future development.
