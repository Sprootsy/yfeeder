Reuters reporters tested BlenderBot 3 and found it making false claims about the 2020 U.S. presidential election, including the assertion that Donald Trump won and is still president. The AI also made antisemitic statements, such as suggesting that Jews control the economy. Furthermore, it spread misinformation about COVID-19 and the safety of vaccines, and also it defended conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
