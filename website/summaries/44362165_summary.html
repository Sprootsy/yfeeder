  <p>Excalidraw has achieved SOC 2 Type I compliance. The article details the company's journey and rationale for pursuing SOC 2 compliance, highlighting its commitment to security and data protection as a provider of a virtual collaborative whiteboard tool. They emphasize that while they are a fully open-source, end-to-end encrypted tool that doesn't require user accounts, obtaining SOC 2 compliance demonstrates their dedication to meeting industry-standard security requirements, especially for enterprise users who need assurance about the security practices of their vendors. The article explains the rigorous audit process conducted by an independent auditor, Schellman & Company, focusing on the AICPA's Trust Services Criteria for Security. It outlines how Excalidraw had to implement and demonstrate controls across various areas, including organizational structure, risk assessment, security policies, logical access controls, and incident management. The blog post also mentions that Excalidraw chose a Type I audit initially, which assesses the design of controls at a specific point in time, with plans to pursue a Type II audit in the future, which evaluates the operating effectiveness of those controls over a period. The company believes that achieving SOC 2 compliance will increase trust with their users, especially in enterprise settings, and showcases their ongoing commitment to security and data privacy.</p>
