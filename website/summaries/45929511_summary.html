<h2>Summary</h2>
The article discusses concerns over the potential return of the European Union's proposal for mass surveillance of private messages. The author suggests that, despite public opposition and previous setbacks, the EU is attempting to reintroduce a similar policy under the guise of combating child sexual abuse material (CSAM). The article highlights worries that the proposed measures would require technology companies to scan private communications, effectively undermining end-to-end encryption and infringing on privacy rights. The author points out that while the stated goal is to protect children, the proposed methods are overly broad and could lead to the monitoring of innocent individuals. It also raises concerns about the potential for abuse and the chilling effect on free expression. The author further suggests that the EU is using emotionally charged language to manipulate public opinion and bypass legitimate concerns about privacy and security.
