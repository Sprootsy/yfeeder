    <h2>EFF to the FTC: DMCA Section 1201 Creates Anti-Competitive Regulatory Barriers</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed comments with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regarding reducing anti-competitive regulatory barriers. The EFF's comments focus on how regulations can unintentionally stifle competition and innovation, particularly in the tech sector. They argue that regulations, while sometimes intended to protect consumers or promote specific social goals, can create barriers to entry for smaller companies and startups, thereby solidifying the dominance of existing large corporations. The EFF emphasizes the need for the FTC to carefully consider the competitive effects of proposed regulations and to avoid imposing rules that disproportionately burden smaller players. They highlight several areas where regulations can have unintended anti-competitive consequences, including data privacy rules, cybersecurity standards, and intellectual property laws. The EFF advocates for a more balanced approach to regulation that promotes both consumer protection and competition, encouraging the FTC to adopt policies that foster innovation and prevent the entrenchment of dominant firms.</p>
