        <h1>Australian who ordered radioactive materials walks away from court</h1>
        <p>
<div>
  <p>An Australian man who ordered radioactive materials online has avoided a criminal conviction. The man, who was studying science at the time, purchased small amounts of americium-241, barium-133, caesium-137, and cobalt-60 over the internet. He claimed that he bought the radioactive substances for use in experiments to learn more about radioactivity. </p>
  <p>The man pleaded guilty to possessing radioactive substances without a license and to transporting radioactive materials without approval. The judge acknowledged that the man had no malicious intent and was driven by scientific curiosity. The judge also noted that the amounts of radioactive material were very small and did not pose a significant risk to public health. </p>
  <p>Considering the man's lack of criminal history, his remorse, and his commitment to continuing his education, the judge decided to impose a two-year good behavior bond without recording a conviction. The judge warned the man that any further offenses could lead to a conviction and potential imprisonment. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) confirmed that the radioactive materials were safely disposed of. </p>
