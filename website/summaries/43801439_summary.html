        <h1>Australian who ordered radioactive materials walks away from court</h1>
        <p>
<div>
<p>An Australian man who ordered radioactive materials online has avoided a conviction. The man, who pleaded guilty to possessing and conveying radioactive substances without permission, was placed on a two-year good behavior bond and ordered to pay A$1000 to a brain cancer charity. He purchased uranium ore, americium, radium, and polonium from eBay between August 2022 and February 2023. The court acknowledged the man's remorse and the absence of malicious intent, accepting that he collected the materials out of scientific curiosity. The judge noted that the quantities involved were small and did not pose a significant risk to the public. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Ansto) analyzed the materials and confirmed the low risk. The prosecution highlighted the potential dangers and the need for regulation but conceded that the man cooperated with authorities and had no prior convictions.</p>
