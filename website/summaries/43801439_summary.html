<div>
<p>An Australian man who ordered radioactive materials online has avoided a criminal conviction. The man, who has not been named, purchased americium-241, barium-133, and caesium-137. He told authorities that he bought the radioactive substances out of curiosity and for use in creating YouTube videos about their properties. He stored the materials in his shed, which raised concerns about potential radiation exposure and environmental contamination. </p>

<p>The man pleaded guilty to possessing radioactive substances without a license. The court acknowledged that his actions constituted a breach of regulations designed to protect public health and safety. However, the magistrate chose not to record a conviction, citing the man's lack of prior criminal history, his remorse, and his cooperation with the authorities during the investigation. The magistrate also noted that the man had taken steps to safely dispose of the radioactive materials after realizing the potential dangers. </p>

<p>The case has highlighted the ease with which radioactive materials can be obtained online and the potential risks associated with such transactions. Authorities are now considering measures to strengthen regulations and increase public awareness about the dangers of handling radioactive substances without proper training and licensing.</p>
