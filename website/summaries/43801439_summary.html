        <h1>Australian who ordered radioactive materials walks away from court</h1>
        <p>

  <p>
   An Australian man who ordered radioactive materials online has avoided a conviction. The man, who was studying chemistry at the time, purchased small quantities of americium-241, iodine-131, and barium-133. He claimed he bought them for educational purposes and to conduct experiments at home.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) was alerted when the man imported the radioactive substances without the required permits. Authorities raided his home in May 2023 and found the materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   In court, the magistrate acknowledged the potential danger of the situation but accepted that the man was genuinely interested in chemistry and did not intend to cause harm. The magistrate also noted the small quantities involved and the man's lack of prior criminal record. Ultimately, the magistrate decided to deal with the matter by way of a good behaviour bond for 12 months, without recording a conviction.
