        <h1>Australian who ordered radioactive materials walks away from court</h1>
        <p>
<div>
<p>A man from Australia who ordered radioactive materials online has avoided conviction. The man, who pleaded guilty to possessing radioactive substances without a license, was spared a criminal record after a magistrate in Victoria opted for a non-conviction order. The court acknowledged the man's lack of malicious intent and his cooperation with the authorities during the investigation. He purchased the radioactive materials, including americium, polonium, and uranium, from eBay. He claimed to be researching nuclear batteries and amateur science. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) analyzed the materials and deemed them a low risk to public safety. The magistrate considered the man's background, including his autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, and his genuine interest in science. He was ordered to pay $3,000 to a forensic science organisation.</p>
