    This document is a Master's thesis exploring methods for automatically recognizing and classifying Named Entities (NEs) within the specialized domain of clinical texts, particularly focusing on German language clinical documents. The core issue addressed is the difficulty of applying standard Named Entity Recognition (NER) models, often trained on general-purpose text, to clinical text due to the unique terminology, context-dependent meanings, and specific entity types relevant in the clinical domain.
  </p>
  <p>
    The thesis provides a comprehensive overview of NER, including its historical development, different approaches (rule-based, machine learning-based, and hybrid), and relevant evaluation metrics. It delves into the challenges of NER in the clinical domain, highlighting the complexities introduced by medical jargon, abbreviations, and the need for high accuracy to avoid potential misinterpretations that could impact patient care.
  </p>
  <p>
    The research investigates various machine learning techniques for clinical NER, focusing on deep learning models like Bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTMs) and Transformers (specifically BERT and its variants). The study aims to determine the effectiveness of these models, particularly when fine-tuned on clinical text data, for identifying and classifying entities such as diseases, symptoms, medications, and anatomical locations.
  </p>
  <p>
    A significant portion of the thesis is dedicated to the creation and annotation of a new German clinical text corpus. This corpus is designed to address the lack of publicly available, high-quality annotated data for German clinical NER. The annotation process involves defining a specific set of entity types relevant to clinical contexts and developing guidelines to ensure consistency and accuracy in the annotation. The thesis details the challenges encountered during corpus creation, such as handling ambiguous terms and maintaining inter-annotator agreement.
  </p>
  <p>
    The thesis presents experiments comparing the performance of different NER models on the newly created corpus, as well as on existing benchmark datasets. The results are analyzed to assess the impact of model architecture, pre-training on clinical data, and the quality of the training data on NER performance. Error analysis is performed to identify common sources of errors and potential areas for improvement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, the thesis explores methods for improving NER performance, such as incorporating domain-specific knowledge, using contextual embeddings, and employing data augmentation techniques. It also discusses the limitations of the current study and suggests directions for future research, including exploring more advanced deep learning architectures, incorporating external knowledge sources, and developing methods for handling noisy or incomplete clinical data. The research concludes by emphasizing the importance of accurate and reliable clinical NER for various applications, such as clinical decision support, information extraction from electronic health records, and medical research.
