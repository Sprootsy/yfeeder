<p>On August 14, 2013, a UPS cargo plane crashed in a wooded area near the Louisville International Airport in Kentucky. The Airbus A300, Flight 1354, was arriving from Louisville when it crashed at approximately 9:40 a.m. ET. Both pilots, the only people on board, were killed in the crash.</p>

<p>Following the crash, emergency crews responded to the scene, where they encountered wreckage spread across a wide area. A thick plume of black smoke rose from the crash site, which was heavily wooded. The crash occurred during daylight hours, but weather conditions were reported to include low visibility due to fog and low clouds.</p>

<p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) launched an investigation to determine the cause of the crash. Investigators examined the wreckage, flight data recorders, and cockpit voice recorder. Factors considered included the weather conditions, the performance of the aircraft, and the actions of the pilots.</p>

<p>Preliminary reports indicated the plane was approaching the airport when it descended rapidly and crashed. The NTSB's investigation focused on the approach to the airport, the pilots' decision-making, and the performance of the aircraft's automated systems. The investigation also reviewed the pilots' training records and experience.</p>

<p>The crash had a significant impact on UPS, the local community, and the families of the pilots. UPS cooperated fully with the investigation and expressed condolences to the families of the deceased pilots. The crash also raised questions about the safety of cargo operations and the role of automation in aviation.</p>

<p>The NTSB's final report attributed the crash to pilot error, specifically the flight crew's failure to adequately monitor the aircraft's airspeed during the approach, their failure to adhere to standard operating procedures, and their inadequate planning and execution of the approach. Contributing factors included fatigue and deficiencies in UPS's training program.</p>
