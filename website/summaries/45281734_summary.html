    The Forbes article, published on September 16, 2025, discusses the potential motivations behind a recent immigration raid that led to the arrest of several Korean individuals. The author, Stuart Anderson, suggests that a quota system implemented by Stephen Miller, likely influenced the arrests. The article posits that Miller, known for his hard-line immigration policies during his time in the Trump administration, may have implemented a quota or target for immigration arrests, specifically focusing on Korean immigrants to fulfill certain objectives. The author suggests that the arrests may have been driven by a desire to meet pre-set numerical targets rather than solely based on violations of immigration laws. The article examines the possibility that the arrests are a consequence of policies that prioritize numerical outcomes over individual circumstances and due process.
