<p>This article discusses the ongoing effort to transition the Linux kernel's documentation to the Sphinx documentation system and reStructuredText format. It highlights a presentation by Alexandre Ghiti at the 2024 Linux Plumbers Conference (LPC) where he outlined the progress, challenges, and future plans for this migration.</p>

<p>The motivation behind this shift is to improve the maintainability, readability, and consistency of the kernel documentation. The existing documentation is in various formats like plain text, DocBook XML, and others, leading to inconsistencies and difficulties in maintenance. Sphinx, with its reStructuredText markup language, offers a more structured and feature-rich environment for creating documentation. It supports cross-referencing, indexing, and output in multiple formats (HTML, PDF, etc.), making the documentation more accessible and user-friendly.</p>

<p>Ghiti's presentation covered the tools and processes involved in the conversion. He discussed the scripts and utilities developed to automate the conversion of existing documentation to reStructuredText. He also mentioned the manual effort required to fix inconsistencies and improve the quality of the converted documentation. The presentation emphasized the importance of community involvement in reviewing and contributing to the documentation effort.</p>

<p>The article details the challenges encountered during the migration, such as dealing with complex DocBook XML structures, handling kernel-specific markup, and ensuring the converted documentation remains accurate and up-to-date. It also touches on the need for better tooling to automate more of the conversion process and simplify the workflow for contributors. One challenge mentioned was the semantic differences that arise from converting from DocBook XML which had elements like &quot;important&quot; to reStructuredText.</p>

<p>The article also mentions the benefits of using Sphinx, including the ability to generate a comprehensive index, improved search functionality, and the option to create different versions of the documentation for different kernel releases. The reStructuredText format is also more human-readable than many of the older formats which will improve contribution rates.</p>

<p>The article concludes by emphasizing the ongoing nature of the documentation migration project and the continued need for community contributions to ensure its success. The move to Sphinx and reStructuredText is a significant undertaking that promises to improve the quality, accessibility, and maintainability of the Linux kernel documentation for years to come.</p>
