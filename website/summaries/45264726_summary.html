   The article is a first-person account of the author being scammed out of $130,000 through a sophisticated scheme involving cryptocurrency and impersonation. The author details how the scammer, posing as someone from a dating app, gradually gained their trust over several months.

   As the relationship and the apparent investment gains grew, the scammer persuaded the author to invest larger sums of money. The author eventually transferred a significant amount, totaling $130,000, from their Coinbase account to the platform. When the author attempted to withdraw their funds, they were met with obstacles and demands for additional "taxes" and "fees" before the withdrawal could be processed. This raised red flags, and the author realized they were being scammed.
