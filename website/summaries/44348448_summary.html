  <p>The article is an app store description for the "Idle Reporter for NYC DEP" mobile application. The app is designed to allow users to report instances of idling vehicles in New York City to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). It facilitates the reporting process by guiding users through the necessary steps to document and submit a valid complaint. The app requires users to provide specific information such as the vehicle's license plate number, location, date, and time of the idling incident. It also requires video evidence of the idling, which must be at least three minutes long and demonstrate continuous idling. The app includes features to help users comply with these requirements, such as a timer to ensure the video is of sufficient length, and guidelines on how to properly capture the evidence. The reported incidents are then submitted to the NYC DEP for review and potential enforcement action. The app aims to make it easier for citizens to participate in reducing vehicle idling, which contributes to air pollution and negatively impacts public health.</p>
