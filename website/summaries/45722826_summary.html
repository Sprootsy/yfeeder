    <h2>Show HN: JSON Query</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <p>The article introduces JSON Query Language (JQL), a declarative language designed for querying, transforming, and validating JSON data. JQL aims to provide a powerful and flexible way to interact with JSON documents, addressing the limitations of existing methods like JSON Pointer and JSONPath, especially when dealing with complex data transformations and schema validation.</p>

  <p>JQL offers several key features. It supports querying JSON data using a SQL-like syntax, allowing users to select, filter, and join data based on specific criteria. It enables data transformation through expressions and functions, facilitating the reshaping and restructuring of JSON documents. JQL also includes schema validation capabilities, allowing users to define constraints and rules for JSON data to ensure data quality and consistency.</p>

  <p>The language is designed to be extensible, allowing users to define custom functions and operators to tailor it to their specific needs. It supports a wide range of data types and operators, including numeric, string, boolean, and array operations. JQL also provides built-in functions for common tasks such as string manipulation, date and time processing, and mathematical calculations.</p>

  <p>The article highlights the benefits of using JQL, including its expressive power, flexibility, and ease of use. JQL simplifies complex data manipulation tasks and promotes code reusability by encapsulating queries, transformations, and validation rules into reusable modules. It is designed to be efficient and scalable, making it suitable for handling large JSON datasets.</p>

  <p>The JQL project is open-source, with implementations available in various programming languages. The language specification is well-documented, and the project provides tools and libraries to facilitate the integration of JQL into existing applications.</p>
