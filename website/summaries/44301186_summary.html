  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    An investigation into the widespread power outage that affected parts of Spain on April 28 has found no evidence of a cyberattack. Enagas, Spain's gas grid operator, stated that the blackout, which impacted around 880,000 customers across several regions, originated from a disruption in the electrical system. The incident led to temporary closures of businesses and traffic disruptions. According to a report by the system operator, Red Electrica, the outage began with an event in the transmission network which caused a cascade of failures. The investigation considered various potential causes, including cyberattacks, but concluded that the event was due to an internal system failure. The report emphasized that security protocols were followed and that the system responded as designed, albeit not quickly enough to prevent the extensive disruption. The findings address concerns raised in the immediate aftermath of the blackout, which prompted speculation about possible external interference. The focus is now on implementing measures to prevent similar incidents in the future, enhancing the resilience of the Spanish electrical grid.
