  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>
   The article introduces the OpenAI Apps SDK, designed to enable developers to build apps that seamlessly integrate with the OpenAI Assistant. This SDK facilitates the creation of tools that can be used across conversations with the Assistant, allowing the Assistant to call these apps to perform specific actions or retrieve information. The core functionality of the Apps SDK revolves around defining an app using a manifest, implementing handlers to process requests, and integrating with the OpenAI platform for authorization and execution.
  </p>
  <p>
   The manifest is a crucial component, as it describes the app's purpose, available functions, and required authentication methods. It also specifies the API endpoints that the Assistant can call. Implementing handlers involves writing code that receives requests from the Assistant, performs the necessary actions (e.g., querying a database, making API calls), and returns a response. These handlers can be written in various programming languages and deployed on different platforms, providing flexibility for developers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Authorization is handled through the Apps SDK, ensuring that the Assistant can securely access the app. The SDK supports different authentication methods, such as OAuth, to manage user identities and permissions. Once an app is built and authorized, it can be installed by users or organizations and used in conversations with the Assistant. The Assistant intelligently determines when to invoke the app based on the user's query and the app's description in the manifest.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Apps SDK provides tools for testing and debugging apps, allowing developers to simulate interactions with the Assistant and verify that the app functions correctly. The SDK also includes features for monitoring app usage and performance, providing insights into how the app is being used and identifying potential issues.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Apps SDK aims to empower developers to extend the capabilities of the OpenAI Assistant, creating a rich ecosystem of apps that can automate tasks, provide information, and enhance the user experience.
