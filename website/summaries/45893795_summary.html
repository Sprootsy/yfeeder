<p>The article is a blog post by Diamond Geezer about the remnants of London's Roman wall and how to find them in the modern city. The author embarks on a walk to discover various visible sections and historical markers related to the wall, often located in unexpected or overlooked places.</p>

<p>The walk begins near the Tower of London, where a significant section of the wall is preserved. The author details how the wall's construction used Kentish ragstone and included a defensive ditch. The post describes the Tower Hill area, noting the statue of Trajan and the accessible fragment of the wall near the underground station. The author then moves to Cooper's Row, pointing out a preserved section of the wall within a hotel, viewable by the public, and discussing the adjacent Roman Bath remains.</p>

<p>The journey continues north, with the author tracing the wall's path along Vine Street and discussing how the wall influenced the layout of the modern street. Further exploration leads to America Square, where a sign marks the wall's location, and then to Crutched Friars, where only a plaque indicates the wall's presence. The author laments the invisibility of the wall in some sections due to development and modern construction.</p>

<p>The blog post then describes the Aldgate area, where a Roman fort once stood outside the wall.

Moving westward, the author encounters more challenging sections to trace, often finding only subtle hints or markers indicating the wall's former path. The author describes the area around St Botolph's church and the difficulty in visualizing the wall's original course.</p>

<p>The author highlights a visible fragment of the wall in the basement of the One America Square building (accessible with permission) and a section integrated into the Barber-Surgeons' Hall. The post mentions the Museum of London's collections related to the Roman wall and its historical significance.</p>

<p>The author reflects on the layers of history embedded within the City of London, where Roman foundations lie beneath medieval streets and modern architecture.
