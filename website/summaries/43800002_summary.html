        <h1>Berkeley Humanoid Lite â€“ Open-source robot</h1>
        <p>
<div>
<p>The Berkeley open source humanoid project is dedicated to creating a low-cost, high-performance humanoid robot platform for research and education. The project emphasizes accessibility and reproducibility, aiming to lower the barrier to entry for robotics research and development. The team has designed and built a complete humanoid robot, including mechanical design, electrical systems, and software. The design files, software, and documentation are publicly available, enabling other researchers and educators to replicate, modify, and build upon their work. The robot features capabilities such as walking, balancing, and object manipulation. The project promotes collaboration and knowledge sharing within the robotics community.</p>
