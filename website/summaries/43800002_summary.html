        <h1>Berkeley Humanoid Lite â€“ Open-source robot</h1>
        <p>
<div>
  <p>The Berkeley Humanoid Robot Learning Lab website describes the research lab's work on developing and applying machine learning techniques to humanoid robots. The lab focuses on enabling robots to perform complex, dynamic tasks in unstructured environments, moving beyond traditional, pre-programmed routines. A key area of research is imitation learning, where robots learn from human demonstrations to acquire skills more efficiently than through traditional reinforcement learning or manual programming. The lab also explores reinforcement learning methods to refine and optimize learned behaviors, allowing robots to adapt to new situations and improve their performance over time. Another area of interest is on leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance robot learning and control. The website highlights various projects, publications, and resources related to their research, showcasing their contributions to the field of robot learning and humanoid robotics.</p>
