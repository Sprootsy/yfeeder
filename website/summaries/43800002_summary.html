        <h1>Berkeley Humanoid Lite â€“ Open-source robot</h1>
        <p>
<div>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The Berkeley Open Source Humanoid (BOSH) project is an initiative at UC Berkeley aimed at developing a low-cost, high-performance humanoid robot platform that is fully open source. The primary goal is to accelerate research and development in humanoid robotics by providing a common, accessible, and well-documented platform for researchers and students. The project addresses the challenges of the high cost and limited availability of advanced humanoid robots, which often hinder progress in the field.</p>
  <p>BOSH is designed with affordability in mind, targeting a price point significantly lower than existing commercial humanoid robots, without sacrificing key performance characteristics. It leverages advanced manufacturing techniques, such as 3D printing and laser cutting, to reduce costs and enable rapid prototyping and iteration. The design emphasizes modularity and ease of assembly, allowing researchers to easily modify and customize the robot for their specific research needs.</p>
  <p>The robot is equipped with a comprehensive set of sensors, including IMUs, force/torque sensors, and encoders, providing rich data for perception and control algorithms. It also features powerful actuators capable of generating human-like motions and interacting with the environment. The software architecture is built on ROS (Robot Operating System), a widely used framework in robotics, which facilitates integration with existing tools and libraries.</p>
  <p>The open-source nature of BOSH is a core principle of the project. All hardware designs, software code, and documentation are publicly available, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing within the robotics community. This allows researchers to build upon the work of others, contribute their own improvements, and collectively advance the state of the art in humanoid robotics.</p>
  <p>The project also places a strong emphasis on education and outreach. BOSH is intended to be a valuable tool for teaching robotics concepts and providing hands-on experience to students. The open-source nature of the platform allows students to delve into the inner workings of a humanoid robot, experiment with different algorithms, and develop their own innovative solutions.</p>
  <p>BOSH represents a significant step towards democratizing access to advanced humanoid robot technology and empowering researchers and students to push the boundaries of robotics research. By providing a low-cost, high-performance, and fully open-source platform, the project aims to accelerate innovation and drive progress in the field of humanoid robotics.</p>
