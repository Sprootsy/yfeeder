        <h1>Berkeley Humanoid Lite – Open-source robot</h1>
        <p>
<div>
  <p>The Berkeley Open Source Humanoid (BOSH) project is an open-source initiative at UC Berkeley aimed at developing affordable, high-performance humanoid robots. The project focuses on creating a full-sized humanoid robot, named “Evo,” with the goal of enabling advanced research in areas like locomotion, manipulation, and human-robot interaction. The central philosophy of BOSH is to make the robot's design, software, and documentation publicly accessible, fostering collaboration and innovation within the robotics community.</p>

  <p>The project emphasizes a balance between performance and cost, utilizing a combination of custom-designed and commercially available components. This approach allows for a powerful and capable robot while keeping the overall cost manageable, making it accessible to a broader range of researchers and developers. The BOSH project uses advanced manufacturing techniques, such as 3D printing and laser cutting, to produce custom parts, which further contributes to cost-effectiveness and design flexibility.</p>

  <p>Evo, the humanoid robot, is designed with a modular architecture, allowing for easy maintenance, repair, and upgrades. This modularity also facilitates experimentation with different hardware configurations and control strategies. The robot features a high degree of freedom, enabling complex and human-like movements. Actuation is achieved through a combination of electric motors and custom-designed transmissions, optimized for both power and precision.</p>

  <p>The software framework for Evo is built on ROS (Robot Operating System), providing a robust and flexible platform for control, perception, and planning. The open-source nature of ROS aligns with the overall BOSH philosophy of open collaboration and knowledge sharing. The software stack includes tools for simulation, allowing researchers to test and validate algorithms in a virtual environment before deploying them on the physical robot.</p>

  <p>The BOSH project places significant emphasis on creating comprehensive documentation, including detailed mechanical drawings, electrical schematics, and software APIs. This documentation is intended to lower the barrier to entry for new users and facilitate contributions from the broader robotics community. The project also actively engages with the community through workshops, tutorials, and online forums, providing opportunities for learning and collaboration.</p>

  <p>The long-term goals of the BOSH project include developing advanced control algorithms for locomotion, manipulation, and interaction. Researchers are working on techniques such as reinforcement learning, model predictive control, and whole-body control to enable Evo to perform complex tasks in unstructured environments. The project also aims to explore applications of humanoid robots in areas such as healthcare, manufacturing, and disaster response.</p>

  <p>By providing an open-source platform for humanoid robotics research, the BOSH project seeks to accelerate innovation and contribute to the development of more capable and versatile robots. The project's commitment to affordability, accessibility, and collaboration makes it a valuable resource for researchers, educators, and enthusiasts alike.</p>
