  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The article "Half of America's Voting Machines Run on Software From a Single Company" by Dissent in Bloom focuses on the dominance of Election Systems & Software (ES&S) in the American voting machine market. It states that ES&S is responsible for about half of all machines used in US elections. The author raises concerns about the lack of transparency, security risks, and potential for biased outcomes associated with relying so heavily on a single, private company for such a crucial aspect of democracy. The author highlights the opaque nature of the software used in these machines, making it difficult to independently verify the accuracy and integrity of election results. Concerns are raised about the proprietary nature of ES&S's software, which limits independent audits and public scrutiny. The article also suggests that the lack of competition in the voting machine market could stifle innovation and lead to complacency regarding security vulnerabilities. It touches upon the history of controversies and allegations surrounding ES&S and other voting machine vendors. The author advocates for greater transparency, open-source voting systems, and robust independent audits to ensure the integrity and reliability of elections. They also emphasize the need for increased public awareness and engagement in election administration to safeguard democratic processes.</p>
