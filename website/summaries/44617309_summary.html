<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The article is a critical reflection on the author's experiences with Element and Matrix.org, detailing their journey from initial enthusiasm to eventual disillusionment and decision to abandon the platform. The author initially appreciated Matrix's promise of a decentralized, open-source communication system, which offered an alternative to proprietary platforms like Discord and Slack. The author highlights the theoretical benefits of decentralization, such as preventing single points of failure and fostering a more democratic communication environment. They discuss their early adoption and advocacy for Matrix, including self-hosting a server and promoting the platform within their social circles.</p>

<p>However, the author's positive outlook gradually deteriorated due to a number of practical issues and concerns. A primary issue was the resource intensity of the Synapse server implementation, which the author found to be a significant drain on system resources, especially RAM and CPU. This made self-hosting a challenge, particularly on less powerful hardware. They explored alternative server implementations like Dendrite and Conduit, but these were either not production-ready or lacked essential features. The article also mentions the memory issues in Element, which the author found to be concerning.</p>

<p>The author expresses frustration with the overall complexity of managing a Matrix server. They describe the process as being significantly more involved than managing other types of servers, such as web servers. This complexity extended to troubleshooting and maintenance, making it difficult to keep the server running smoothly. The lack of user-friendly tools and the steep learning curve were major obstacles.</p>

<p>Privacy concerns also contributed to the author's decision to leave Matrix. They were troubled by the fact that direct messages were not end-to-end encrypted by default and the complex process of enabling encryption. The author was worried about metadata retention, where even with encrypted messages, information about who is communicating with whom and when is still stored, which they saw as a privacy risk. They also mention that while federation is a core feature, it also means that data is distributed across multiple servers, increasing the potential for exposure or compromise.</p>

<p>The article also criticizes the official Element client, citing issues such as high memory usage, performance problems, and a lack of polish. The author found the client to be less reliable and efficient compared to other messaging applications. Additionally, they express concerns about the direction of development, feeling that the focus was shifting towards features that prioritized revenue generation over user experience and privacy.</p>

<p>The author also notes that Element/Matrix is very slow to receive updates in comparison to other applications that they use. They indicate that other applications receive updates at a much faster rate and with improvements that make the updates worth installing. They feel that Element/Matrix is slow to receive feature updates and these features are often not as functional as they would like them to be.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the author concludes that the practical drawbacks and privacy considerations outweighed the theoretical benefits of Matrix. They decided to shut down their Matrix server and migrate to alternative messaging platforms that they felt offered a better balance of usability, performance, and privacy. The article serves as a cautionary tale for potential Matrix adopters, highlighting the challenges and compromises involved in using the platform.</p>
