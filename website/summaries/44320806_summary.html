  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
   The article "In Praise of Normal Engineers" celebrates the value and importance of ordinary, reliable engineers in the tech industry, contrasting them with the often-hyped "brilliant" or "rockstar" engineers. It argues that while exceptional engineers can be valuable in specific situations, they are often more trouble than they're worth due to their ego, unconventional working styles, and tendency to overcomplicate solutions.

   The author contends that "normal" engineers, who are characterized by their consistency, collaborative spirit, and ability to deliver solid, maintainable code, are the backbone of successful engineering teams. These engineers may not be the fastest coders or the most innovative thinkers, but they are dependable, communicate well, and prioritize the long-term health of the codebase and the team.

  <p>
   The article highlights several specific qualities that make normal engineers so valuable. They write clear, understandable code that is easy for others to maintain and extend. They focus on solving problems effectively and efficiently, rather than trying to create overly complex or clever solutions. They are team players who are willing to share their knowledge, help others, and participate in code reviews. They are also good communicators who can explain technical concepts clearly and concisely.

   Furthermore, the author suggests that companies should actively seek out and cultivate normal engineers. This involves creating a work environment that values collaboration, communication, and mentorship. It also means providing opportunities for normal engineers to grow and develop their skills, and recognizing their contributions to the team's success.

   In conclusion, the article advocates for a shift in perspective, away from the glorification of "rockstar" engineers and towards a greater appreciation for the reliability, consistency, and collaborative spirit of normal engineers. It argues that these engineers are the unsung heroes of the tech industry and are essential for building successful and sustainable software products.
