    <h2>No credible tie between Tylenol use and autism/ADHD study finds</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>A recent study involving over 240,000 children has found no significant association between acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy and an increased risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children. This contradicts previous research that had suggested a potential link between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and neurodevelopmental issues. The study, conducted by researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, analyzed data from a large cohort of children born in Sweden, using prescription data to determine acetaminophen use during pregnancy. The findings indicate that the associations observed in earlier studies might be explained by other factors, such as underlying health conditions or genetic predispositions shared by parents and children. Researchers emphasized the importance of managing pain and fever during pregnancy and suggest that pregnant individuals should follow medical advice regarding medication use.</p>
