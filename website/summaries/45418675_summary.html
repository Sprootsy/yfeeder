<h2>Summary</h2>
The article is about Apple's unveiling of its new AI strategy, dubbed "Apple Intelligence," at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). It details how Apple is integrating AI deeply into its operating systems (iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia) while emphasizing user privacy. Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience through features like improved Siri, writing tools, image generation, and more context-aware notifications.

A core aspect of Apple's approach is on-device processing for many AI tasks, ensuring data stays on the user's device. For more complex requests, Apple introduces "Private Cloud Compute," which uses Apple silicon servers to process data in a privacy-preserving manner. Apple emphasizes that this system undergoes independent inspection to verify its security claims.

The article further explores specific features powered by Apple Intelligence. Siri is receiving a significant upgrade, becoming more natural, contextually aware, and capable of handling complex tasks across apps. New writing tools will help users rewrite, proofread, and summarize text in various applications. Image generation capabilities are also being introduced, allowing users to create images from sketches or text prompts. Other features include smart replies in Mail, improved search functionality, and more relevant notifications.

The article also mentions Apple's partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its ecosystem. Users will be able to access ChatGPT's capabilities through Siri, with Apple emphasizing privacy protections for this integration.

Finally, the article touches on the system requirements for Apple Intelligence. It will be available on iPhone 15 Pro and later models, as well as iPads and Macs with M1 chips or later. The initial release will be in US English, with other languages to follow.
