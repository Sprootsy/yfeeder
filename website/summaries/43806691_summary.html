  <p>
    The article "Dad and the Egg Controller" is a humorous and nostalgic account of the author's experience with their father's invention â€“ an egg-vending machine controller built in the 1980s using a Motorola 6803 microprocessor. The author recounts the evolution of the controller, from its initial design to its eventual replacement, and the challenges and quirks associated with it. The story blends technical details with personal anecdotes, painting a picture of a resourceful and inventive father who applied his engineering skills to a practical problem.

    The author details the technical aspects of the controller, including its memory (4KB of EPROM and 128 bytes of RAM), input/output (I/O) mechanisms (using a Motorola 6821 PIA), and the programming language used (likely assembly language). The controller managed the vending machine's coin detection, dispensing mechanism, and display.

    The narrative highlights the limitations of the technology available at the time, such as the small memory capacity, the need for manual programming, and the challenges of debugging. It also emphasizes the ingenuity required to overcome these limitations. The author shares specific stories of problems encountered with the controller, such as issues with coin detection and the dispensing mechanism, and how their father devised solutions.

    The author also touches on the broader context of the time, including the rise of microprocessors and the increasing accessibility of technology to hobbyists and inventors. The story celebrates the spirit of innovation and the ability to create practical solutions using limited resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ultimately, the egg controller was replaced by a more modern system. However, the author emphasizes the lasting impact of their father's creation, both in terms of its practical application and its role in shaping their own interest in technology. The story is a tribute to a father's ingenuity and a reminder of the early days of microcomputer technology.
