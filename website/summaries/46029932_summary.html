  <p>The article discusses RuBee, a packet-based, peer-to-peer wireless networking protocol operating in the magnetic induction band. It contrasts RuBee with RFID, highlighting RuBee's advantages in security, privacy, and determinism. Unlike RFID, RuBee uses active tags that communicate with each other and readers, creating a network without relying on a single central server for all tag data, and it is designed for environments where item-level tracking is crucial but where security and privacy are paramount. The author details the technical specifications of RuBee, including its low frequency (131 kHz), short read range (up to 30 feet), and collision avoidance mechanisms. The protocol's architecture supports features such as mutual authentication, data encryption, and tag-to-tag communication. The author also covers use cases for RuBee, such as tracking weapons, securing documents, and monitoring high-value assets. The deterministic nature of RuBee allows it to be used in safety-critical applications where reliability and predictability are essential. The article emphasizes the security features of RuBee, including resistance to eavesdropping and replay attacks, making it suitable for applications where data protection is a primary concern. The author positions RuBee as a superior alternative to RFID in certain applications, especially those requiring enhanced security, privacy, and deterministic performance.</p>
