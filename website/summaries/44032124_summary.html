    <h2>Company Reminder for Everyone to Talk Nicely About the Giant Plagiarism Machine</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>The article is a satirical company memo instructing employees on how to discuss the company's new "Giant Plagiarism Machine" (presumably an AI or large language model) in a positive light, both internally and externally. The memo is filled with absurd and ethically questionable directives, highlighting the potential for corporations to prioritize positive PR over genuine integrity when deploying such technologies.</p>

  <p>The memo starts by acknowledging the existence of the Giant Plagiarism Machine and its purpose, which is thinly veiled as content generation. It then mandates that all communication about the Machine must be relentlessly optimistic. Employees are forbidden from using words like "plagiarism," "theft," or "intellectual property infringement." Instead, euphemisms like "content curation," "idea harvesting," and "efficient synthesis" are to be used exclusively.</p>

  <p>The memo addresses various scenarios, including employee concerns about the Machine's ethical implications. Employees are instructed to deflect these concerns by highlighting the Machine's efficiency and cost-effectiveness. They are also told to emphasize the Machine's potential to "democratize content creation," even if it means devaluing the work of human creators.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the memo dictates how employees should respond to external criticism of the Machine. The recommended strategy involves gaslighting critics by accusing them of being "resistant to innovation" or "afraid of progress." The memo also suggests subtly implying that critics are jealous of the company's success. If all else fails, employees are authorized to deploy the "Bore Them To Death" strategy by overwhelming critics with jargon-filled explanations of the Machine's technical capabilities.</p>

  <p>The memo also provides specific talking points to use when discussing the Machine's output. Employees are encouraged to describe the Machine's output as "unique and original," even if it is blatantly derivative. They are also told to emphasize the Machine's ability to "generate content at scale," regardless of its quality.</p>

  <p>The memo concludes by reminding employees that their compliance is essential for the company's success. It warns that any employee who violates the memo's guidelines will be subject to disciplinary action. The memo is signed by "Legal and PR," underscoring the company's prioritization of legal compliance and positive public image over ethical considerations.</p>
