<p>The article discusses the ongoing debate within the Linux kernel development community regarding the inclusion of Rust code. While Rust offers memory safety advantages that could potentially eliminate entire classes of kernel bugs, its integration is not without controversy. Some developers raise concerns about the practical benefits, potential performance overhead, and the introduction of a second language into the kernel. The article highlights a session at the Linux Plumbers Conference where various perspectives were shared, focusing on the need for real-world examples to demonstrate Rust's value and address performance concerns. Concrete use cases, such as using Rust for specific drivers or security-sensitive modules, are seen as crucial for gaining wider acceptance. The discussion also touched upon the challenges of interfacing Rust code with existing C code in the kernel and ensuring that Rust code adheres to the kernel's coding standards and performance expectations. Overall, the article portrays a community cautiously exploring the potential of Rust, weighing its advantages against the potential costs and complexities of its adoption.</p>
