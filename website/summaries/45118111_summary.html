  <h2>Summary: AI-Generated Metal Kernels</h2>
  <p>The Gimlet Labs blog post discusses their exploration of using AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), to generate metal music "kernels." These kernels are short, raw musical ideas – riffs, melodies, or rhythmic patterns – that can serve as the foundation for creating full metal songs. The post details the challenges and creative potential of this approach. The authors trained a model on a dataset of metal MIDI files, focusing on guitar parts, to enable it to produce new metal riffs. They experimented with different prompts and parameters to guide the AI's output and explored the process of refining these AI-generated kernels into more complete musical arrangements. The article highlights the iterative nature of working with AI in this context, where the AI acts as a creative partner, generating initial ideas that are then curated, edited, and expanded upon by human musicians. The authors also address the limitations and biases inherent in training AI on existing musical data and discuss their efforts to mitigate these issues and encourage originality. They emphasize that the goal is not to replace human creativity but to augment it, opening up new avenues for musical exploration and composition. They touch on the technical aspects of the project, including the selection of the dataset, the model architecture, and the methods used to evaluate and refine the AI's output. The blog post also showcases examples of AI-generated metal kernels and demonstrates how these kernels can be transformed into complete song sections. Ultimately, the project demonstrates the potential of AI as a tool for musical ideation and collaboration, while also acknowledging the importance of human input and artistic judgment in the creative process.</p>
