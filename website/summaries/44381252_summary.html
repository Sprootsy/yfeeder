  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
   The article "Negative 2000 Lines Of Code" on folklore.org recounts a humorous anecdote about a project manager who claimed to have delivered a significant amount of "negative lines of code" by deleting unnecessary code, thereby improving the overall quality and efficiency of a software system.

  <p>
   The story centers around the concept that code isn't inherently valuable.  The value of code is not in its quantity but its quality and contribution to the system's goals.  The project manager's claim, while initially counter-intuitive and amusing, highlights the importance of code reduction, refactoring, and simplification.  It suggests that removing redundant, obsolete, or poorly written code can be more beneficial than adding new features or lines.

   The anecdote is meant to be a lighthearted illustration of a crucial principle in software development: that less is often more.  By removing unnecessary code, developers can reduce complexity, improve maintainability, decrease the likelihood of bugs, and enhance overall performance.
