<p>According to veteran market analyst Peter Atwater, the current artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy is significantly larger than both the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and the subprime mortgage crisis of the mid-2000s. Atwater's analysis centers on the concept of "Counter-Narrative Risk," which suggests that substantial economic bubbles arise when a widely accepted narrative takes hold, obscuring underlying risks and creating an environment ripe for speculative investment. He argues that the prevailing narrative around AI as a transformative technology with limitless potential has fueled excessive investment and valuation, creating a bubble of unprecedented proportions.</p>

<p>Atwater quantifies the size of the AI bubble by comparing the market capitalization of companies associated with each respective bubble at their peak. He calculates that the AI bubble is 17 times the size of the dot-com bubble and four times the size of the subprime bubble. This staggering difference underscores his concern about the potential economic fallout when the AI bubble eventually bursts. He suggests that the inflated valuations of AI-related companies are not justified by their current earnings or future prospects, and that a correction is inevitable.</p>

<p>The analyst points to several factors contributing to the AI bubble's immense size. First, the narrative surrounding AI has been exceptionally powerful, capturing the imagination of investors and policymakers alike. Second, the availability of capital has been abundant, with venture capitalists, private equity firms, and public market investors all eager to invest in AI-related ventures. Finally, the fear of missing out (FOMO) has driven many investors to chase returns in the AI sector, regardless of the underlying fundamentals. Atwater warns that when the narrative shifts and investors begin to question the viability of AI-driven business models, the market could experience a sharp and painful correction.</p>

<p>Atwater doesn't explicitly predict when the AI bubble will burst, but he emphasizes that all bubbles eventually do. He advises investors to exercise caution and to carefully evaluate the fundamentals of AI-related companies before investing. He also suggests diversifying portfolios and avoiding excessive exposure to the AI sector. His analysis serves as a stark warning about the potential risks associated with the AI frenzy and highlights the importance of critical thinking and risk management in today's investment environment.</p>
