  <p>The article is a personal account of why the author chose Lua as the programming language for their blog. The author outlines the criteria they considered when selecting a language, focusing on ease of embedding, simplicity, performance, and security. They emphasize the blog's purpose: serving static content quickly and reliably without complex features or dynamic content generation.</p>
  
  <p>The author considered other languages like PHP, Python, JavaScript (Node.js), Go, and Rust. PHP was dismissed due to its association with dynamic websites and potential security vulnerabilities when handling user-generated content. Python was deemed too heavy for the task, with a large standard library and a more complex syntax than needed. JavaScript (Node.js) was rejected because the author wanted to avoid JavaScript on the server-side, and the asynchronous nature felt like overkill for a simple blog. Go was considered a strong contender, praised for its performance and simplicity, but ultimately deemed more complex than Lua for this specific use case. Rust was also appreciated for its performance and safety, but its steeper learning curve and more involved development process were seen as unnecessary for a simple blog.</p>
  
  <p>Lua stood out due to its small size, ease of embedding into other applications, simple syntax, and good performance. The author highlights Lua's design as an extension language, making it suitable for customizing and extending applications without requiring a complete rewrite. They appreciate that Lua can be readily integrated into a web server like Nginx using the OpenResty framework, allowing for request handling and content serving to be managed through Lua scripts. This approach enables the author to serve static content efficiently and implement custom logic (if needed) directly within the web server, rather than relying on external applications or complex server-side frameworks.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, the author chose Lua because it allows them to build a simple, fast, and secure blog with minimal overhead. The small language footprint, ease of embedding, and straightforward syntax made it an ideal choice for a project focused on serving static content efficiently. They also value its ability to be readily integrated into the web server environment through OpenResty, enabling a streamlined and optimized setup. The author emphasizes that while other languages might be suitable for more complex projects, Lua perfectly aligns with the specific requirements and constraints of their blog.</p>
