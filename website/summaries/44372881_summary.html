  <p>This article is a tutorial on how to create a basic application using Xtool, a framework for building user interfaces. It guides the user through setting up a development environment, creating a project, defining a data model, building a user interface, and running the application.
  </p>
  <p>The tutorial begins by outlining the prerequisites, which include having Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. It then walks the user through the process of installing the Xtool CLI (Command Line Interface) globally using npm. The Xtool CLI is used to create and manage Xtool projects.</p>
  <p>Next, the tutorial explains how to create a new Xtool project using the <code>xtool create</code> command, specifying a project name (e.g., "my-first-app"). The CLI generates a basic project structure with necessary files and directories.  The user is then directed to navigate into the project directory.</p>
  <p>The tutorial then shifts to defining the data model for the application. It shows how to create a model file and define the data structure using Xtool's model definition syntax. This involves specifying fields with their data types and any associated validation rules. The example data model might include fields like name, email, and age. It emphasizes the importance of a well-defined data model for data integrity and consistency.</p>
  <p>With the data model defined, the tutorial moves on to building the user interface. It describes how to create UI components, such as forms, tables, and buttons, using Xtool's UI component library. It explains how to bind the UI components to the data model, allowing for data input, display, and manipulation. It also covers how to define event handlers to respond to user interactions, such as button clicks or form submissions.</p>
  <p>The tutorial then guides the user on how to configure routing. Routing is the process of directing users to different parts of the application based on the URL or user actions. Xtool provides a routing mechanism to define routes and associate them with specific UI components or views. This enables the creation of a multi-page application with navigation between different sections.</p>
  <p>Finally, the tutorial explains how to run the Xtool application using the <code>xtool serve</code> command. This command starts a development server that hosts the application. The user can then access the application in a web browser and interact with the UI. The tutorial also highlights Xtool's hot-reloading feature, which automatically updates the application in the browser whenever changes are made to the code.</p>
