<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The article on Sustainability by Numbers discusses the environmental impact of contrails, which are artificial clouds formed by the condensation of water vapor from airplane exhaust. While they may appear harmless, contrails trap outgoing longwave radiation (heat) from the Earth, contributing to global warming. The author highlights that contrails have a significant climate impact, possibly rivalling or even exceeding that of aviation's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The atmospheric lifetime of CO2 is very long, while the warming effect of contrails is short-lived, creating both challenges and opportunities for mitigation. </p>

<p>The core of the article explores strategies for reducing contrail formation. It emphasizes that contrails only form under specific atmospheric conditions, primarily when the air is very cold and humid. The key solution presented is to slightly alter flight paths to avoid these ice-supersaturated regions (ISSRs) where contrails are likely to develop. This involves using weather forecasting to identify ISSRs and adjusting flight altitudes by as little as a few thousand feet, or making small lateral deviations. The author presents research and real-world tests demonstrating that such rerouting can significantly reduce contrail formation with minimal increases in flight time or fuel consumption. </p>

<p>Airlines can strategically avoid altitudes where contrails are more likely to form, typically between 25,000 and 40,000 feet. Weather models capable of accurately predicting ice-supersaturated regions are crucial for effective contrail mitigation. The article cites the work of organizations like the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and initiatives like the Clean Skies for Tomorrow coalition, which are actively developing and testing contrail avoidance strategies. </p>

<p>The author acknowledges the challenges involved in implementing contrail avoidance, including the need for accurate weather forecasting, coordination between air traffic control and airlines, and potential trade-offs with other factors like fuel efficiency and flight time. However, the potential benefits of reducing contrail-induced warming are substantial. </p>

<p>The article concludes by emphasizing that contrail avoidance is a promising near-term strategy for mitigating aviation's climate impact. Unlike transitioning to alternative fuels or developing new aircraft technologies, which require significant investment and time, contrail avoidance can be implemented relatively quickly and cost-effectively. This approach offers a valuable tool for addressing the immediate warming effects of aviation while longer-term solutions are pursued.</p>
