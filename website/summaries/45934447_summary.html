 <h3>Summary</h3>
 <p>
 The article discusses AssemblyAI, an AI company valued at $1 billion, and its origins. The co-founder, Dylan Fox, revealed that their initial transcription service, priced at $100 per month, was not powered by sophisticated AI as perceived. Instead, it was manually done by two individuals who transcribed audio notes by hand, fueled by pizza. This revelation challenges the perception of instant AI-driven solutions and highlights the "Wizard of Oz" method, where human labor simulates AI capabilities in the early stages of development. AssemblyAI later transitioned to automated transcription using machine learning models but initially relied on manual labor to validate the demand and refine their product. This approach allowed them to generate revenue and improve their services before fully automating the process. The article underscores the importance of understanding the behind-the-scenes operations of AI companies and the human effort often involved in the early stages of AI development.
