    <h2>Google is hurting new apps that have less users than competitors</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p>The Google Play Console displays a "Fewer users" warning in the Reach and Devices section for some apps. This warning indicates that the app may not be available to all potential users on Google Play due to device compatibility or other targeting settings. This can be triggered by various factors, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Device Compatibility:</strong> The app may not be compatible with all device models, Android versions, or hardware features. This can be due to specific requirements in the app's manifest or build configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Targeting Settings:</strong> The app may be targeting a specific set of users based on country, language, or other demographic factors.</li>
<li><strong>API Level Requirements:</strong> The app may require a minimum API level that excludes older devices.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware Requirements:</strong> The app may require specific hardware features (e.g., camera, gyroscope) that are not available on all devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>The warning serves as a signal to developers to review their app's configuration and targeting to ensure it is reaching the intended audience. While the warning itself doesn't directly prevent users from installing the app, it highlights potential limitations in the app's reach. Developers should investigate the reasons behind the warning and make necessary adjustments to their app or its configuration to broaden its availability, if desired.</p>

<p><b>Key Points:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>"Fewer users" warning appears in Google Play Console.</li>
<li>It indicates limited app availability.</li>
<li>Caused by device compatibility, targeting settings, API level, or hardware requirements.</li>
