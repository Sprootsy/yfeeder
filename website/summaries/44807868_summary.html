    <div>
<div>
  <p>KittenTTS is a fast and high-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) system. It emphasizes efficiency and performance, making it suitable for real-time applications and resource-constrained environments. The system is built with a focus on speed and low VRAM usage. KittenTTS uses a VITS architecture and knowledge distillation to reduce model size. It supports multiple languages and offers features like voice cloning. Pre-trained models and detailed instructions are provided for users to get started quickly. The project is open-source and welcomes contributions from the community.</p>
