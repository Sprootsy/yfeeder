  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article is a fictional blog post dated July 24, 2025, detailing the author's ongoing struggle with their 2021 16-inch MacBook Pro not sleeping properly. The author humorously describes the problem, stating that despite closing the lid, the MacBook Pro continues to run, draining the battery and generating heat. They've tried various suggested solutions found online, including resetting the SMC, disabling Power Nap, and examining system logs using <code>pmset</code>, all to no avail.

    The author suspects a specific process is preventing sleep, and they meticulously examine the output of <code>pmset -g log</code>, looking for wake events and identifying potential culprits. They highlight the difficulty in interpreting the log data and the frustration of dealing with cryptic error messages and hexadecimal addresses. The author focuses on processes that are "preventing idle sleep."

    The post humorously chronicles the author's descent into sleep deprivation as they spend countless nights troubleshooting the issue, even resorting to using a shell script to monitor and potentially kill the offending process. They express exasperation with the lack of clear solutions and the seemingly random nature of the problem.

    The author eventually identifies a recurring process, potentially related to a cloud storage service or background task, as a possible cause. Through trial and error involving quitting applications and monitoring sleep behavior, they narrow down the likely culprit.
