  <p>According to the article, Apple has lost a UK App Store monopoly case, and the penalty might be near £2 billion. The Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) ruled against Apple, stating that its restrictions on app developers hinder innovation and choice. The case was brought forward by Sean Ennis, a professor at the Centre for Competition Policy at the University of East Anglia. Ennis argued that Apple's policies, which require most apps to be distributed through the App Store and mandate the use of Apple's payment system, stifle competition and lead to higher prices for consumers. The tribunal sided with the claimant. The ruling could lead to significant changes in how Apple operates its App Store in the UK, potentially forcing the company to allow alternative app stores and payment methods. The article suggests that this could lead to increased competition, lower prices, and greater innovation in the app market. The potential fine of near £2 billion reflects the scale of Apple's operations in the UK and the estimated harm caused by its anti-competitive practices.</p>
