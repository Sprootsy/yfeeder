This article is a fictional piece from The New York Times, dated November 26, 2025, detailing significant legal and political developments related to Donald Trump. The central event is Trump's appearance for a green card interview, a consequence of his marriage to a naturalized U.S. citizen. The article paints a picture of high drama and legal peril surrounding the former president.
</p>
<p>
The article outlines that Trump's green card application process has been fraught with complications. Legal experts cited in the article suggest that Trump's past actions and statements, particularly those made during his presidency and after leaving office, could be grounds for denying his application. Specifically, his involvement in the January 6th Capitol attack, his past rhetoric regarding immigrants, and ongoing investigations into his business dealings are presented as potential obstacles to obtaining a green card.

<p>
During the interview, Trump asserted his innocence regarding the January 6th events and defended his past immigration policies as necessary for national security. He characterized the investigations into his business as politically motivated witch hunts. However, the article indicates that the immigration officials conducting the interview pressed him on inconsistencies in his statements and potential conflicts of interest.
</p>
<p>
Adding to the drama, the article reports that several individuals associated with Trump were arrested on various charges, including obstruction of justice and campaign finance violations, in the hours leading up to and following the green card interview. These arrests are portrayed as potentially linked to information uncovered during investigations related to Trump.
</p>
<p>
The article also delves into the political ramifications of these events. It describes a nation deeply divided, with Trump's supporters rallying behind him and denouncing the legal proceedings as a politically motivated attack. Conversely, his critics view the situation as evidence that no one is above the law and that Trump is finally being held accountable for his actions.

<p>
The White House, under a different administration, has maintained a neutral stance, emphasizing the independence of the Justice Department and the importance of due process. However, the article notes that the situation presents a significant political challenge for the current president, who must navigate the fallout from these events while attempting to maintain stability and unity.
</p>
<p>
The article concludes by noting that the green card decision is pending and that the legal and political battles surrounding Trump are likely to continue, regardless of the outcome. The arrests of his associates and the ongoing investigations suggest a broader legal reckoning may be underway, with potentially far-reaching consequences for Trump and his inner circle.
