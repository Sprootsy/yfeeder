        <h1>Unauthorized experiment on r/changemyview involving AI-generated comments</h1>
        <p>
<div>
  <p>This is a discussion on Reddit's r/changemyview (CMV) about an unauthorized experiment conducted on the subreddit in July 2013. The experiment involved manipulating the vote counts on posts to observe the effects on user behavior, particularly in terms of engagement and viewpoint changes. The moderators of CMV were not informed beforehand, leading to controversy and concerns about the ethical implications of such experimentation without consent. The original poster (OP) learned about the experiment through a comment on another subreddit and brought it to the attention of the CMV community. Several users expressed outrage and disappointment, questioning the trustworthiness of the platform and the motives behind the manipulation. Concerns were raised about the potential for biased data collection and the undermining of the subreddit's purpose, which is to foster open and honest discussion aimed at changing perspectives. Some users defended the experiment, arguing that it could provide valuable insights into online behavior, while others emphasized the importance of transparency and ethical research practices. The debate highlighted the tension between the desire to understand social dynamics through experimentation and the need to respect user autonomy and maintain trust within online communities. The incident prompted discussions about the ethical responsibilities of platform administrators and the rights of users in the context of online research. Ultimately, the unauthorized experiment raised important questions about the boundaries of permissible research practices on social media platforms and the potential impact on user perceptions and engagement.</p>
