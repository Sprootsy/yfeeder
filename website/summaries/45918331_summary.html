He tries various methods to produce an egg, including eating different foods and sitting in the hens' nests, but nothing works. His attempts lead to ridicule from the other chickens, especially Henrietta, the head hen.</p>
  <p>One day, a farmer's wife needs eggs for a cake and is short one egg. In desperation, she decides to use a duck egg.

The other hens realize that different isn't necessarily bad, and that variety can be valuable.</p>
