<p>The article discusses the increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) features into various software and platforms, often without explicit user consent or clear understanding. It argues that companies are aggressively pushing AI functionalities onto users, sometimes at the expense of established workflows and user experience. The author expresses concern about the potential for AI to replace human creativity and control, leading to a homogenization of content and a loss of individual expression.</p>

<p>The article highlights examples of AI integration in photo editing software, writing tools, and search engines. It notes that while some AI features can be genuinely helpful, others feel intrusive and unnecessary. The author criticizes the lack of transparency surrounding how AI algorithms work and the data they collect, raising privacy concerns. There is also apprehension about the potential for AI to perpetuate biases and create filter bubbles, limiting users' exposure to diverse perspectives.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the piece points out that the rapid adoption of AI may lead to job displacement and a devaluation of human skills. The author suggests that users should be more discerning about the AI features they use and demand greater control over how AI is integrated into their digital experiences. Ultimately, the article advocates for a more balanced approach to AI adoption, one that prioritizes user autonomy and creativity while mitigating the potential risks.</p>
