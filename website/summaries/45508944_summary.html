<h2>Summary</h2>
On October 6, 2025, Governor Newsom signed Senate Bill (SB) 576 into law, aimed at regulating the audio levels of commercials in California. The new law addresses the common consumer complaint about commercials being significantly louder than the regular programming they accompany. SB 576 mandates that all television and radio commercials broadcasted in California maintain the same average volume level as the programs they interrupt. This measure seeks to provide a more consistent and comfortable listening experience for viewers and listeners, preventing the jarring effect of excessively loud commercials. The law is set to take effect on January 1, 2027, giving broadcasters and advertisers ample time to adjust their audio production and transmission practices to comply with the new regulations. The California Broadcasters Association has expressed conditional support, acknowledging the need to address the issue while also seeking clarity on specific technical standards to ensure smooth implementation. Consumer advocacy groups have lauded the bill as a significant victory for consumers, emphasizing that it will reduce annoyance and improve the overall media consumption experience. The enforcement of SB 576 will be overseen by the California Department of Consumer Affairs, which will be responsible for investigating complaints and ensuring compliance. Penalties for violations may include fines and other corrective actions.
