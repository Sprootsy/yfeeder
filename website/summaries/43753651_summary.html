        <h1>A new form of verification on Bluesky</h1>
        <p>
 <div>
  <p>The article discusses Bluesky's updated approach to account verification, emphasizing user control and portability. The goal is to allow users to verify their accounts using methods they prefer, independent of the platform itself. The new system moves away from Bluesky acting as the sole verifier and enables users to use third-party verification services. It highlights the limitations of relying solely on platform-based verification, noting that it can be easily manipulated and doesn't solve the core issue of establishing trust in online identities.</p>
  <p>The updated verification system has three layers. The first layer involves the basic identity and reputation of an account based on social connections. This is represented by following relationships and mutuals within the Bluesky network. The second layer is Custom Verification, which allows accounts to display a checkmark provided by a third-party verification service. Users can choose which verification services they trust and see checkmarks from those services accordingly. The third layer is Official Verification, which is specifically for governments and organizations. This is currently managed by Bluesky, which provides a checkmark to indicate that the account is officially recognized. </p>
  <p>The article details how Custom Verification works. Users can select a verification provider from their profile settings. The provider will then confirm the user's identity, often through a link to the user's website or other identity confirmation methods. Once verified, the user will display a checkmark chosen by the provider, which is visible to other users who trust that provider. Users can customize which providers they trust, and the displayed checkmarks will update based on their selections. </p>
  <p>The article also explains how Bluesky handles Official Verification. To ensure that official accounts are properly identified, Bluesky directly verifies governments and organizations. This verification process is intended to be rigorous and reliable. Official accounts display a special checkmark symbol distinct from custom verification checkmarks. Bluesky maintains a list of officially verified accounts, which users can view to confirm the legitimacy of these entities. </p>
  <p>The article emphasizes the benefits of this new system. It provides users with more control over their verification status and allows for a more decentralized and portable approach to identity verification. By enabling custom verification, Bluesky allows users to choose verification providers they trust, improving the overall trust and safety of the platform. The combination of social connections, custom verification, and official verification aims to create a more robust and trustworthy online environment. </p>
