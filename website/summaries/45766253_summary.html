<p>The article is a personal account detailing a negative experience with Wise (formerly TransferWise), a popular online money transfer platform. The author, Shaun, recounts how his business, a small New Zealand-based software company, encountered significant issues that led them to cease using Wise entirely. The core of the problem revolved around Wise's compliance procedures, specifically their handling of a large incoming payment and the subsequent freezing of the account.
</p>
<p>Initially, the author was a satisfied Wise customer, praising its convenience and cost-effectiveness for international transactions, especially for paying contractors and receiving payments from overseas clients. However, their positive perception dramatically shifted when they received a substantial payment from a new client in the US, intended for a significant software development project.
</p>
<p>Upon receiving the funds, Wise flagged the transaction and requested additional documentation to verify the source and legitimacy of the funds, a standard procedure to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. Shaun and his team promptly provided all the requested documents, including the contract with the client, invoices, and details about the nature of their business.
</p>
<p>Despite providing the requested information, Wise continued to delay the verification process. The author describes a frustrating cycle of submitting documents, receiving assurances that the review was underway, and then facing further requests for additional information. This prolonged delay had a significant impact on their business operations. They were unable to access the funds to pay their contractors, which threatened project timelines and damaged their reputation.
</p>
<p>The communication with Wise's customer support was described as poor and unhelpful. The author found it difficult to get clear answers or a definitive timeline for the resolution of the issue. The support team seemed unable to provide specific reasons for the ongoing delays and often gave generic responses, exacerbating the frustration and uncertainty.
</p>
<p>After a considerable period, during which the account remained frozen, Wise eventually informed the author that they were unable to verify the source of the funds and would be returning the money to the sender. This decision was made despite the author's repeated attempts to provide all necessary documentation and clarification.
</p>
<p>The author expresses deep disappointment and frustration with Wise's handling of the situation. He argues that Wise's compliance procedures, while intended to prevent illicit financial activity, were implemented in a way that was overly bureaucratic, inflexible, and ultimately detrimental to legitimate businesses. He criticizes the lack of transparency, the poor communication, and the significant disruption caused to his company's operations.
</p>
<p>As a result of this experience, the author decided to discontinue using Wise for any future transactions. He advises other businesses to exercise caution when using the platform, particularly for large transactions, and to be aware of the potential for unexpected account freezes and lengthy verification processes. The article serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the potential risks associated with using online money transfer services and the importance of considering alternative options, especially when dealing with significant financial transactions.
