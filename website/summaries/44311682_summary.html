  <p>The article is a comprehensive guide on how to set up a personal website and blog using GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and a custom domain. It walks the reader through the entire process, starting with choosing a domain name and purchasing it from a registrar like Google Domains. Then, it explains how to configure the domain's DNS settings to point to GitHub Pages servers by creating A records and a CNAME record.</p>

  <p>The tutorial then describes the steps to create a GitHub repository for the website and configure it to use GitHub Pages. It details the options for choosing a Jekyll theme, either by selecting one from the Jekyll Themes website or creating a custom theme. The author uses the "minima" theme as an example and explains how to customize it by modifying the `_config.yml` file, which controls various aspects of the website's appearance and behavior, such as the title, description, and navigation menu. Also, the article explains how to configure the `baseurl`.</p>

  <p>The article then moves on to creating content for the blog. It explains how to create new blog posts by creating Markdown files in the `_posts` directory, following the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md`. It provides an example of a basic blog post with YAML front matter for metadata like title, date, and layout. The author also explains how to create custom layouts to display content differently from the default layout. The article emphasizes using Markdown syntax for writing content.</p>

  <p>The author covers setting up the custom domain with GitHub Pages. It explains how to add the custom domain to the repository settings, which automatically creates a `CNAME` file in the root directory of the repository. It also describes how to enforce HTTPS for the website for better security.</p>

  <p>The article also provides information on how to handle 404 errors by creating a custom `404.html` page and how to add Google Analytics tracking to the website by including the Google Analytics tracking code in the default layout file. This allows tracking website traffic and user behavior.</p>

  <p>Finally, the article touches on more advanced topics such as using a Gemfile to manage Jekyll plugins, using GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), and using a CDN (Content Delivery Network) like Cloudflare to improve website performance. It also briefly discusses other static site generators like Hugo and Gatsby, offering alternatives to Jekyll.</p>

  <p>In essence, the article is a step-by-step guide for anyone who wants to create a simple, personal website or blog using free tools like GitHub Pages and Jekyll, combined with a custom domain for a professional look.</p>
