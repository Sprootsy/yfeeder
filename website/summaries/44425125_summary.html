<p>The article is a transcript of a seminar given by Dan McQuillan titled "Components of Platform Counter-Conduct." The seminar explores the concept of "platform counter-conduct" as a means of resisting and subverting the power and control exerted by dominant digital platforms. McQuillan frames these platforms not simply as neutral technologies, but as powerful infrastructures shaping social relations, knowledge production, and political action. He argues that a critical approach is needed to understand how platforms operate and how they can be challenged.</p>

<p>McQuillan begins by outlining the increasing dominance of platform capitalism and its implications for various aspects of life. He emphasizes the ways in which platforms extract data, commodify user activity, and shape user behavior through algorithms and interfaces. He critiques the often-unacknowledged power imbalances inherent in platform ecosystems, where a few large corporations wield significant control over vast networks of users and resources. He also highlights the role of platforms in shaping public discourse and influencing political outcomes.</p>

<p>The core of the seminar focuses on defining and exploring "platform counter-conduct." McQuillan draws on the work of Michel Foucault to understand conduct as the management of conduct, both of oneself and of others. Counter-conduct, then, is resistance to these forms of management and control. In the context of platforms, counter-conduct involves developing strategies to challenge the ways in which platforms shape behavior, extract value, and exercise power.</p>

<p>McQuillan proposes several key components of platform counter-conduct. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Understanding Platform Architectures:</b> Analyzing the technical and social infrastructures of platforms to identify points of vulnerability and potential for intervention. This involves a critical examination of algorithms, data flows, and governance structures.</li>
<li><b>Developing Alternative Platforms:</b> Creating alternative platforms that embody different values and priorities. This might involve building decentralized, open-source, or cooperative platforms that prioritize user autonomy and data sovereignty.</li>
<li><b>Practicing Data Resistance:</b> Implementing strategies to protect user data and disrupt the flow of information to platforms. This could involve using privacy-enhancing technologies, engaging in data strikes, or developing alternative data governance models.</li>
<li><b>Challenging Algorithmic Bias:</b> Identifying and challenging the biases embedded in platform algorithms. This requires developing methods for auditing algorithms and advocating for greater transparency and accountability.</li>
<li><b>Building Solidarity and Collective Action:</b> Fostering solidarity among users and workers affected by platform power. This involves creating networks of support, organizing collective actions, and advocating for policy changes.</li>
<li><b>Promoting Platform Literacy:</b> Educating users about the workings of platforms and the potential risks they pose. This involves developing critical media literacy skills and promoting awareness of alternative technologies and practices.</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the seminar, McQuillan emphasizes the importance of a multi-faceted approach to platform counter-conduct. He argues that no single strategy is sufficient to challenge the power of platforms and that a combination of technical, social, and political interventions is needed. He also stresses the importance of ongoing experimentation and learning, as platforms are constantly evolving and adapting.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the seminar provides a framework for understanding and resisting the power of dominant digital platforms. By identifying key components of platform counter-conduct, McQuillan offers a set of practical strategies for challenging the ways in which platforms shape our lives and for building more just and equitable digital futures.</p>
