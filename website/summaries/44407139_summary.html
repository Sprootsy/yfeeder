<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
The Deno blog post announces the release of Deno version 1.42, codenamed "Oracle 4". A major focus of this release is on improving the Deno Language Server (Deno LS), which provides enhanced IDE support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and JSX/TSX. The update brings significant performance improvements to Deno LS, with up to 5x faster project loading and 10x faster code completion in certain scenarios.
</p>
<p>
The performance gains are attributed to optimizations in module resolution, caching, and lazy parsing. These improvements make Deno LS more responsive and efficient, resulting in a smoother coding experience for developers.
</p>
<p>
Beyond the Deno LS improvements, version 1.42 introduces support for configuring the TLS version used in HTTP/1.1 requests, giving developers more control over network security. This allows specifying a minimum TLS version (e.g., TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3) for outgoing requests, enhancing compatibility and security when interacting with different servers.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the release includes enhancements to Deno's built-in testing framework.  The `--filter` flag now supports more complex filtering patterns using glob syntax, making it easier to target specific tests or groups of tests.
</p>
<p>
The update also addresses various bug fixes and minor improvements across the Deno runtime and standard library. This includes improved compatibility with Node.js APIs.
