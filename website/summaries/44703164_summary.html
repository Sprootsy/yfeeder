  <p>This repository contains research related to telemetry data collected from various versions of the game Team Fortress 2 (TF2) by the "TRAE" project, which is associated with the Source Auto Record (SAR) mod. The primary goal of the research is to understand and document the structure, format, and content of the telemetry data, potentially reverse engineering it for analysis and further application.</p>

  <p>The repository includes several key components:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Telemetry Format Documentation:</b> Detailed specifications of the telemetry data formats for different TF2 versions, primarily focusing on how data is structured and organized.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Data Samples:</b> Examples of actual telemetry data files captured from various TF2 clients. These samples are crucial for understanding the practical structure and variability of the data.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Parsing Scripts and Tools:</b> Scripts and tools designed to parse and extract information from the telemetry data. These tools help in converting raw telemetry into a more usable format.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Analysis and Research Notes:</b> Documentation of the research process, including observations, findings, and potential use cases for the telemetry data.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The research focuses on different aspects of the telemetry data:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Reverse Engineering:</b> Attempting to reconstruct the original data structures and meanings of the telemetry fields by analyzing captured data.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Data Integrity:</b> Assessing the reliability and accuracy of the telemetry data, including identifying potential errors or inconsistencies.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Potential Uses:</b> Exploring various applications of the telemetry data, such as game analysis, player behavior analysis, and detection of cheating or exploits.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The repository is structured to facilitate collaboration and contribution from the community. It encourages users to share their own findings, tools, and analyses related to TF2 telemetry data. The ultimate aim is to create a comprehensive resource for understanding and utilizing TF2 telemetry, benefiting researchers, modders, and game enthusiasts alike.</p>

  <p>The content of the repository is likely to be of interest to individuals involved in game development, data analysis, reverse engineering, and the Team Fortress 2 community.</p>
