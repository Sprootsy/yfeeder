    <h2>Tested: Microsoft Recall can still capture credit cards and passwords</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>According to The Register, security researcher Kevin Beaumont has discovered that Microsoft's Recall feature in Windows can capture sensitive information, including credit card details, in plain text screenshots. Recall, which takes periodic screenshots of a user's activity to allow them to search and "recall" past actions, stores these screenshots in an unencrypted database by default. Beaumont demonstrated that this lack of encryption makes it easy for attackers to access and steal sensitive data, such as credit card numbers entered on websites, simply by browsing the stored screenshots. He criticized Microsoft for the poor security design of Recall, especially given the sensitive nature of the data it handles. Beaumont also pointed out that even if users exclude certain applications from being captured, the data might still be exposed if the application renders its content using standard Windows APIs. The report raises serious privacy and security concerns about the Recall feature and questions Microsoft's approach to data protection.</p>
