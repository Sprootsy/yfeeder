        <h1>Milwaukee police considering trading mugshots for facial recognition tech</h1>
        <p>
<div>
<p>Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) is considering a trade with DataWorks Plus, a company that provides law enforcement technology. The proposed deal would involve MPD providing its archive of mugshots in exchange for access to DataWorks Plus's facial recognition software. This software could potentially help identify suspects in crimes by comparing images from surveillance footage or other sources against the mugshot database.</p>

<p>The potential trade has sparked significant debate and raised concerns among civil liberties advocates and some members of the Milwaukee Fire and Police Commission. Opponents of the deal worry about the accuracy of facial recognition technology, particularly its potential for misidentification and bias against people of color. They also express concerns about privacy and the potential for mass surveillance if the technology is implemented without proper safeguards and oversight.</p>

<p>DataWorks Plus claims its facial recognition software is accurate and can significantly aid law enforcement in solving crimes. They argue that the technology can help identify suspects more quickly and efficiently than traditional methods, leading to safer communities. They also emphasize that the software is only a tool and that human judgment is still required in the identification process.</p>

<p>The Milwaukee Fire and Police Commission is responsible for overseeing the police department and will ultimately decide whether to approve the proposed trade. The commission is currently weighing the potential benefits of the technology against the potential risks to privacy and civil liberties. They are also considering the need for clear policies and regulations to govern the use of facial recognition technology if it is implemented.</p>

<p>The debate over facial recognition technology in Milwaukee reflects a broader national conversation about the use of technology in law enforcement. Proponents argue that these tools can make communities safer and more efficient, while opponents raise concerns about privacy, accuracy, and potential for abuse. The decision in Milwaukee will likely have implications for other cities considering similar technologies.</p>
