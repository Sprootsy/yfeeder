   The article "What Went Wrong With Wireless USB?" on oldvcr.blogspot.com, written in May 2025, explores the reasons behind the failure of Wireless USB (WUSB) to gain widespread adoption, despite its initial promise. The author reminisces about the excitement surrounding the technology in the mid-2000s, when it was touted as a cable-free solution for connecting peripherals like printers, storage devices, and displays to computers. The article delves into the technical specifications of WUSB, highlighting its use of the 5 GHz radio frequency band and its theoretical maximum data transfer rate of 480 Mbit/s, equivalent to USB 2.0. It contrasts this with the significantly slower speeds achieved in real-world scenarios.

   The author identifies several key factors contributing to WUSB's downfall. Firstly, the technology was plagued by high costs. WUSB devices and adapters were considerably more expensive than their wired counterparts, making them less attractive to consumers, especially when the promised convenience didn't fully materialize. Secondly, WUSB suffered from performance issues. The actual data transfer rates were often much lower than the theoretical maximum, and the connection could be unreliable, particularly over longer distances or when obstructions were present. This inconsistency undermined the user experience and made WUSB less practical for many applications.

   Furthermore, the article points to the emergence of competing wireless technologies, such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, as a significant challenge to WUSB. Bluetooth offered a lower-power, more affordable solution for connecting peripherals like keyboards and mice, while Wi-Fi provided higher bandwidth and broader compatibility for networking and internet access. These alternatives gradually eroded the market for WUSB, as consumers found them to be more versatile and cost-effective. The lack of strong industry support and a clear use case also contributed to WUSB's demise. Unlike other wireless technologies that were backed by major players and had well-defined applications, WUSB struggled to gain traction and carve out a niche for itself. The author concludes that WUSB was ultimately a technology ahead of its time, but its high cost, inconsistent performance, and the rise of competing standards sealed its fate.
