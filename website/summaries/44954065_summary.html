   This article discusses the potential consequences of widespread age verification on the internet, particularly focusing on the UK's Online Safety Bill. The author argues that while the intention behind age verification – protecting children from harmful content – is laudable, the methods proposed to achieve it are deeply flawed and could fundamentally alter the internet as we know it.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article highlights several significant concerns. Firstly, age verification systems are often inaccurate and unreliable. They can be easily bypassed by tech-savvy individuals, rendering them ineffective for their intended purpose. Conversely, they can create significant barriers for legitimate users, particularly those from marginalized communities who may lack the necessary identification documents or digital literacy to navigate these systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   Secondly, the implementation of age verification raises serious privacy concerns. To verify age, users are often required to provide sensitive personal information, which could be vulnerable to data breaches, misuse, or even surveillance by governments or corporations. The creation of centralized databases of user data for age verification purposes is particularly alarming, as it creates a honeypot for malicious actors and poses a significant threat to individual privacy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thirdly, the article argues that age verification could lead to the balkanization of the internet. As different countries or regions implement their own age verification requirements, it could become increasingly difficult for users to access content from other parts of the world. This could stifle free expression, limit access to information, and hinder the global exchange of ideas.
  </p>
  <p>
   Furthermore, the author contends that age verification could disproportionately harm smaller websites and online platforms. Implementing and maintaining age verification systems can be costly and technically challenging, potentially driving smaller players out of the market and further consolidating power in the hands of large tech companies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article also suggests that age verification might lead to unintended consequences, such as encouraging children to lie about their age or seek out riskier content through unregulated channels.
  </p>
  <p>
   In conclusion, the author warns that age verification, while well-intentioned, is a dangerous and ineffective approach to online safety. It threatens privacy, freedom of expression, and the open nature of the internet. The author urges policymakers to reconsider this approach and explore alternative solutions that prioritize education, parental controls, and targeted interventions to protect children online without compromising the fundamental principles of the internet.
