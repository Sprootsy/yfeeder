    <h2>US gives local police a face-scanning app similar to one used by ICE agents</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <p>Summary:</p>
  <p>The article discusses the rollout of a face-scanning app called NeoFace Reveal, developed by NEC, to local law enforcement agencies across the United States. This technology, already in use by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), allows officers to scan individuals' faces and compare them against a database of mugshots and driver's license photos, potentially identifying suspects in real-time. The app is being offered to local police departments at no cost, raising concerns about privacy, potential for misuse, and the accuracy of facial recognition technology. Civil liberties advocates fear that this widespread adoption could lead to increased surveillance, especially in communities of color, and raise questions about due process and the potential for false matches leading to wrongful arrests or detentions. Concerns are also voiced about the lack of transparency and oversight regarding how the technology is being implemented and used by local law enforcement.</p>
