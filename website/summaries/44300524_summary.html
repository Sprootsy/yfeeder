  <p>The article discusses the upcoming end of life (EOL) for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025. It clarifies that after this date, Microsoft will no longer provide security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support for the Home and Pro editions of Windows 10. Users have three primary options: upgrade to Windows 11 (if their hardware is compatible), purchase an Extended Security Update (ESU) license, or migrate to a new operating system. The ESU license is a paid option that provides security updates for up to three years, but it becomes progressively more expensive each year. The article emphasizes the importance of taking action to avoid running an unsupported operating system, which poses significant security risks. It advises users to check their hardware compatibility with Windows 11, and if not compatible, consider upgrading their hardware or exploring alternative operating systems like Linux. The article also highlights the potential costs associated with each option, including the cost of new hardware, the ESU license, or the time and effort required to migrate to a different OS.</p>
