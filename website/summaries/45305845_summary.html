   According to a Bloomberg News report, former U.S. President Donald Trump is considering imposing a new fee of at least $100,000 on companies seeking H-1B visas for foreign workers if he is elected in 2024. This proposal is part of a broader strategy to fund more robust efforts to train American workers for high-skilled jobs. Sources familiar with the matter indicated that the substantial fee aims to discourage companies from hiring foreign employees and incentivize them to invest in domestic talent. The idea reflects Trump's long-standing "America First" approach to immigration and employment. The specifics of the plan are still under discussion, but the significant increase in costs associated with H-1B visas signals a potential shift in immigration policy under a future Trump administration.
