<p>The article discusses the potential for payment processors like Visa and Mastercard to censor or restrict access to video games and online platforms. It highlights concerns that these financial institutions could act as gatekeepers, deciding which content is permissible and which is not, based on political or moral considerations.</p>

<p>The article begins by pointing out how Visa and Mastercard have become increasingly involved in content moderation, particularly concerning adult content and other controversial material. It raises concerns that this power could extend to video games, potentially impacting developers and players. The article notes that these companies have enormous influence because they facilitate the vast majority of online transactions. If they decide to restrict payments to certain platforms or for specific games, it could effectively shut down access to those products. It gives the example of how adult sites have been impacted by the decisions of Visa and Mastercard.</p>

<p>The article points out that the issue is not just about adult content. Any game with political themes, violence, or other potentially controversial content could be at risk. The article further notes the lack of transparency and accountability in these decisions. Because Visa and Mastercard are private companies, they are not subject to the same regulations and oversight as government entities. This raises questions about due process and the potential for arbitrary or biased enforcement.</p>

<p>Valve's Steam platform and other marketplaces like Itch.io are particularly vulnerable because they host a wide range of games, including many indie titles that may not have the resources to challenge a payment processor's decision. Furthermore, the article also discusses the challenges faced by game developers in countries with strict censorship laws. If payment processors comply with these laws, it could prevent developers from selling their games internationally.</p>

<p>The article brings up the idea of alternative payment methods, such as cryptocurrencies, which could provide a way to circumvent these restrictions. However, these options are not yet widely adopted and have their own challenges, such as volatility and regulatory uncertainty.</p>

<p>The piece concludes by emphasizing the need for greater awareness and discussion about the potential for payment processors to censor video games. It also suggests exploring alternative solutions to ensure that developers and players can continue to access a wide range of content without undue restrictions.</p>
