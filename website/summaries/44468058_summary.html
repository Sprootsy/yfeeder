    The article "Prompting LLMs Is Not Engineering" by Dmitrii introduces a critical perspective on the prevalent notion of "prompt engineering" in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs). The author contends that the term "prompt engineering" is a misnomer and does not accurately reflect the nature of interacting with and guiding LLMs. Instead, the author argues that prompting is more akin to a form of skillful communication or even a type of reverse psychology than a systematic engineering discipline.

    The article begins by challenging the core idea that crafting prompts for LLMs is analogous to traditional engineering. Engineering, the author points out, involves a methodical approach, grounded in scientific principles, and characterized by predictability and control. Engineers design systems with specific requirements, build them with precision, and test them rigorously to ensure they meet predetermined standards. In contrast, prompting LLMs is described as an iterative, experimental process that lacks the deterministic nature of engineering. The responses of LLMs can be unpredictable and are influenced by numerous factors, including the model's training data, the specific architecture, and even random variations in the generation process.

    Dmitrii emphasizes that the effectiveness of a prompt often relies on intuition, trial and error, and a deep understanding of how the specific LLM being used tends to respond to different types of inputs. The author draws a parallel between prompting and communicating with humans, where understanding the audience (in this case, the LLM) and framing the message in a way that resonates with them is crucial. This is more akin to a craft or an art than a science.

    The author discusses the role of "prompt engineering" in extracting desired behaviors or outputs from LLMs. Many practitioners are focused on techniques such as few-shot learning (providing examples in the prompt), chain-of-thought prompting (guiding the model to break down complex problems), and other strategies aimed at improving the quality and relevance of the model's responses. However, the article suggests that even these techniques are not applied with the same level of rigor and predictability as engineering practices.

    The article contrasts the iterative nature of prompt development with the more structured phases of engineering projects. In engineering, changes are carefully planned, documented, and tested to ensure they do not introduce unintended consequences. In contrast, prompt development is often characterized by rapid experimentation and adjustments based on observed outputs.

    Instead of "prompt engineering," the author suggests that alternative terms like "prompt crafting," "prompt design," or even "prompt whispering" might be more appropriate. These terms would more accurately convey the nuanced, iterative, and somewhat unpredictable nature of working with LLMs.
  </p>

    The author acknowledges that some aspects of interacting with LLMs can be systematized and improved through better tools, techniques, and frameworks. However, the fundamental point remains that prompting is not, and perhaps cannot be, a true engineering discipline due to the inherent complexity and unpredictability of LLMs.
  </p>

    Ultimately, the article encourages a more realistic and nuanced understanding of the process of interacting with LLMs. By recognizing the limitations of the "prompt engineering" paradigm, practitioners can adopt more effective strategies for guiding LLMs and managing expectations about their capabilities.
