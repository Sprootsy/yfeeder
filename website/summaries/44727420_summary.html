  <h3>Summary:</h3>
  <p>
   A recent study from the University of Guelph reveals a concerning trend: honey bee deaths are increasing in Ontario, Canada, despite a significant reduction in the use of antibiotics. The research, led by Prof.кинути Ernesto Guzman and post-doc Alison McAfee, analyzed data from 2014 to 2022, encompassing over 6,000 beekeeping operations. The study found that while antibiotic use has nearly halved, winter mortality rates of honey bee colonies have risen to about 40 percent, and total annual mortality has reached approximately 50 percent.

   The researchers investigated potential causes for the increased mortality, focusing on factors beyond antibiotic use. They found a strong correlation between higher mortality rates and the presence of the Varroa mite, a parasite that weakens bees and transmits viruses. Additionally, the study suggests that the type of winter feed provided to bees may play a role. Colonies fed protein-rich supplements tended to fare better than those fed only sucrose.

   The findings emphasize the complex challenges facing honey bee populations. While reducing antibiotic use is a positive step in combating antibiotic resistance, it doesn't address the other significant threats to bee health, such as Varroa mites and nutritional deficiencies. The researchers highlight the need for beekeepers to focus on integrated pest management strategies to control Varroa mites and to ensure bees receive adequate nutrition, particularly during the winter months. The study underscores the importance of ongoing research to understand and address the various factors contributing to honey bee mortality, ensuring the sustainability of these vital pollinators.
