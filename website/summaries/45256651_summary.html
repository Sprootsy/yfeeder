  <p>The article discusses the increasing trend of companies engaging in "enshittification," a term coined by Cory Doctorow to describe the degradation of online platforms. This process typically involves three stages: first, the platform attracts users by offering them value; second, the platform starts to favor its business partners, often at the expense of users; and third, the platform begins to extract excessive value from everyone, including both users and partners.</p>
  <p>The author uses several examples to illustrate this phenomenon. Amazon, once known for customer-centricity, now prioritizes profits by flooding its marketplace with low-quality, counterfeit products and manipulative advertising. Facebook, initially a social networking platform, has become a vehicle for intrusive advertising and surveillance, diminishing the user experience. Similarly, Google's search results have become increasingly cluttered with ads and SEO-optimized content, making it harder to find relevant information. Even platforms like Reddit, previously valued for their user-generated content and community moderation, are now pushing for monetization through aggressive advertising and API changes that harm third-party apps and moderators.</p>
  <p>The article argues that this pattern is driven by the desire for endless growth and shareholder value. Companies prioritize short-term profits over long-term sustainability and user satisfaction. This leads to a race to the bottom, where platforms compete to extract the most value from their users, even if it means sacrificing quality and trust. The author also suggests that the lack of viable alternatives contributes to this problem. Users often feel trapped on these platforms due to network effects and a lack of interoperability, making it difficult to switch to better alternatives.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the article touches on the regulatory challenges in addressing enshittification. Current antitrust laws often focus on consumer prices, which may not capture the full extent of the harm caused by platform degradation. The author suggests that regulators should consider broader measures of consumer welfare, including factors like privacy, data security, and the quality of online content. Additionally, the article emphasizes the importance of promoting competition and interoperability to prevent platforms from becoming entrenched monopolies.</p>
  <p>The article concludes by emphasizing the need for a shift in perspective, both for companies and for regulators. Companies should prioritize long-term sustainability and user value over short-term profits, while regulators should adopt a more holistic approach to antitrust enforcement. The author hopes that by raising awareness about the problem of enshittification, it will be possible to create a more equitable and sustainable online ecosystem.</p>
