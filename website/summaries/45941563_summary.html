<p>The author recounts an experience from November 2025 involving a substantial tariff levied by UPS on a package from Canada. The package, declared at $355, incurred a customs duty and tax bill of $684. UPS initially provided vague explanations for the high charge, attributing it to customs and brokerage fees. The author details the frustrating process of trying to understand the breakdown of the fees, encountering unhelpful UPS representatives who provided conflicting information.</p>

<p>The author eventually discovers that the exorbitant fee was largely due to a Harmonized System (HS) code misclassification. The item, a specialized adapter cable, was incorrectly classified under a code meant for finished network switches, which carried a significantly higher duty rate (25%) than the appropriate code for adapter cables (0%). This misclassification alone accounted for a large portion of the unexpected cost. The author also notes that UPS charged a substantial brokerage fee, a percentage of the declared value plus a flat fee, for their role in processing the customs paperwork, even though the misclassification was arguably their error or the sender's.</p>

<p>The author expresses frustration with the lack of transparency in the customs and brokerage process and the difficulty in rectifying errors. They highlight the power imbalance between individuals and large corporations like UPS when dealing with complex customs regulations. The author also notes that he tried to rectify the situation, without success, and that the adapter cable served its purpose despite the hefty price.</p>

<p>The blog post serves as a cautionary tale about the potential for unexpected and substantial fees when importing goods, particularly when relying on courier services to handle customs clearance. It underscores the importance of accurate HS code classification and the need to scrutinize customs invoices carefully.</p>
