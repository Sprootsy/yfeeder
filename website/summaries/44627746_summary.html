<p>Amazon's carbon emissions increased by 6% in 2024, primarily due to the expansion of its data center infrastructure to support its growing cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Despite efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, the rapid growth of AWS has outpaced these initiatives. The company's total emissions reached 76.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. While Amazon is investing in renewable energy projects, these projects have not yet fully offset the emissions from its data center operations and other business activities. The company aims to power its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025 and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. However, the increase in emissions indicates the challenges Amazon faces in balancing its business growth with its sustainability goals. The report highlights the complexities of reducing emissions in the face of expanding data center infrastructure and the need for continued investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency measures.</p>
