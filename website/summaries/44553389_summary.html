  <p>Summary:</p>
  <p>
   The article discusses the increasing concentration of power in the hands of a few major corporations across various sectors, specifically highlighting that five companies now control over 90% of the market share in many industries. It emphasizes how this consolidation has led to reduced competition, potentially stifling innovation, and negatively impacting consumers through higher prices and fewer choices. The author points out that this trend is not accidental but rather a consequence of specific policy choices and lax enforcement of antitrust laws over several decades. The article suggests that this extreme market concentration poses a threat to economic dynamism and fairness, arguing for a reevaluation of antitrust policies to promote a more competitive landscape. It also delves into the specific examples of industries dominated by a handful of players.
