<p>The article introduces LLASATTS, a Lightweight Language-Agnostic Software Architecture Transformation Tool Suite. This suite is designed to facilitate the analysis and transformation of software architecture represented as graphs. It focuses on providing a language-agnostic approach, meaning it can work with various architectural description languages (ADLs) as long as they can be represented in a suitable graph format. The tool suite comprises several components that work together to achieve its goals, including parsers, graph databases, analysis algorithms, transformation engines, and code generators. The aim is to provide a flexible and extensible framework for software architects and researchers to experiment with different architectural patterns, transformations, and quality attribute analyses.</p>

<p>The primary motivation behind LLASATTS is the increasing complexity of modern software systems and the need for effective tools to manage and evolve their architectures. Existing tools often lack the flexibility to handle diverse architectural styles and are tightly coupled to specific languages or platforms. LLASATTS addresses these limitations by providing a generic, graph-based representation that can be adapted to different ADLs. This allows architects to work with their preferred languages while still benefiting from the tool's analysis and transformation capabilities.</p>

<p>The suite supports various architectural analysis tasks, such as detecting architectural violations, assessing performance characteristics, and identifying potential security vulnerabilities. It also enables architectural transformations, such as refactoring, pattern application, and technology migration. These transformations can be automated or semi-automated, depending on the complexity and the desired level of control. The modular design of LLASATTS allows users to customize the tool suite by adding new analysis algorithms, transformation rules, or code generators. The article also suggests that the tool suite can be used in education for teaching software architecture concepts.</p>
