<p>The article "The Ear Does Not Do a Fourier Transform" by Inigo Quilez challenges the common misconception that the human ear performs a Fourier transform to analyze sound. The author argues that while the ear does decompose sound into different frequency components, this process is fundamentally different from a true Fourier transform. The article begins by explaining the basic principles of the Fourier transform, highlighting its properties such as linearity, time invariance, stability, and the ability to perfectly reconstruct a signal from its frequency components. It then delves into the anatomy and physiology of the ear, describing how sound waves travel through the outer, middle, and inner ear. The cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure in the inner ear, is identified as the primary site of frequency analysis. Inside the cochlea, the basilar membrane vibrates in response to sound, with different locations along the membrane responding maximally to different frequencies. Hair cells located on the basilar membrane convert these vibrations into electrical signals that are sent to the brain.

The author emphasizes that the ear's frequency analysis is not a Fourier transform for several reasons. First, the ear's analysis is not perfectly linear. The ear's response to sound is not directly proportional to the sound's amplitude, especially at high intensities. This non-linearity is important for the ear's ability to handle a wide range of sound pressure levels. Second, the ear's analysis is not perfectly time-invariant. The ear's response to a sound depends on the timing and context of the sound. The ear adapts to ongoing sounds, a process known as adaptation, which means that the ear's response to a sound changes over time. Third, the ear's frequency resolution is limited. The ear cannot perfectly distinguish between two closely spaced frequencies. This limitation is due to the physical properties of the basilar membrane and the spacing of the hair cells. Fourth, the ear does not preserve phase information. The Fourier transform preserves both the amplitude and phase of each frequency component. However, the ear is relatively insensitive to the phase of sound, meaning that the brain primarily uses amplitude information to perceive sound. Fifth, the ear does not perform a global analysis of sound. The Fourier transform is a global operation that requires knowledge of the entire signal. The ear, on the other hand, performs a local analysis of sound, with different locations along the basilar membrane responding to different frequencies at different times. This local analysis allows the ear to process sound in real-time.

The article then contrasts the ear's mechanism with a spectrogram, a visual representation of the frequencies in a sound as they vary over time, which is often mistakenly equated to what the ear does. While spectrograms use short-time Fourier transforms to analyze sound, the ear's analysis is more akin to a bank of bandpass filters. Each location along the basilar membrane acts as a filter, selectively responding to a narrow range of frequencies. The outputs of these filters are then processed by the brain to create our perception of sound. The author also clarifies that while mathematical tools like wavelet transforms might offer better models of auditory processing than the Fourier transform, the fundamental point remains that the ear's mechanism is distinct from any strict mathematical transform. The article concludes by reiterating that while the Fourier transform is a powerful tool for analyzing sound, it is not an accurate model of how the ear works. Understanding the true nature of auditory processing requires considering the ear's non-linearities, time-varying behavior, limited frequency resolution, and insensitivity to phase. The ear performs a complex and nuanced analysis of sound that is far more sophisticated than a simple Fourier transform.
