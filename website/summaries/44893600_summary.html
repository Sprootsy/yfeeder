  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has finalized a lightweight cryptography standard designed to protect small devices with limited resources. These devices, which include sensors, actuators, and other components of the Internet of Things (IoT), often have limited processing power, memory, and battery life, making it challenging to implement traditional cryptographic algorithms. The new standard, FIPS 203, defines a suite of cryptographic algorithms specifically optimized for these resource-constrained environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    The NIST Lightweight Cryptography (LWC) project was initiated to address the growing need for secure communication and data protection in the IoT ecosystem. The project involved a multi-year effort to evaluate and select the most suitable algorithms for lightweight cryptography. The selection process involved a public call for submissions, followed by rigorous testing and analysis by NIST and the cryptographic community.
  </p>
  <p>
    The FIPS 203 standard includes the ASCON family of algorithms, which provides authenticated encryption and hashing functionalities. Authenticated encryption algorithms provide both confidentiality and integrity protection, ensuring that data is both encrypted and protected from tampering. The ASCON family was chosen for its strong security properties, high performance in resource-constrained environments, and ease of implementation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The standard specifies the use of the ASCON-128 and ASCON-128a algorithms for authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD), which are suitable for protecting sensitive data transmitted between IoT devices or between devices and cloud servers. Additionally, the standard includes the ASCON-Hash and ASCON-Xof algorithms for hashing and extendable-output functions (XOFs), which can be used for data integrity checks, message authentication codes (MACs), and other cryptographic applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    By providing a standardized suite of lightweight cryptographic algorithms, NIST aims to promote the adoption of secure cryptographic practices in the IoT ecosystem. The standard will help device manufacturers, developers, and service providers to implement robust security measures in their products and services, protecting sensitive data and ensuring the privacy and security of users. The FIPS 203 standard is expected to play a crucial role in fostering trust and confidence in the growing IoT landscape.
