<p>
Intel and the U.S. government have reached a preliminary agreement to provide the chipmaker with $8.5 billion in direct funding and up to $11 billion in loans under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. This funding aims to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing, reduce reliance on Asian suppliers, and create thousands of jobs.
</p>
<p>
The deal will support Intel's investments in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico, and Oregon, facilitating the production of cutting-edge chips and secure microelectronics for the U.S. military and intelligence communities. Intel plans to invest over $100 billion in U.S. chip projects over five years.
</p>
<p>
The funding is expected to create over 30,000 jobs directly at Intel and support nearly 100,000 indirect jobs. The Commerce Department emphasizes that the agreement includes provisions for worker training and community investment.
</p>
<p>
While Intel has faced recent financial challenges and has cut costs, this government support provides a significant boost to its efforts to regain its leading position in the semiconductor industry. The agreement also includes investment tax credits, potentially covering up to 25% of qualified capital expenses.
</p>
<p>
The CHIPS Act aims to incentivize companies to manufacture chips in the U.S., addressing concerns about national security and supply chain vulnerabilities. Other companies, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and Samsung, are also expected to receive funding under the act.
</p>
<p>
The deal with Intel represents a major step in the U.S. government's broader strategy to revitalize the domestic semiconductor industry and ensure a secure supply of crucial technology.
