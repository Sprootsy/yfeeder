  <p>This webpage is the online portal for Stanford University's CS234 course, titled "Reinforcement Learning." It provides comprehensive materials for students taking the class, including lecture slides, homework assignments, and other resources. The course aims to provide a solid introduction to the field of reinforcement learning, covering a range of topics from fundamental concepts to advanced algorithms. The materials are structured to facilitate learning and understanding of RL principles and techniques. The content includes both theoretical foundations and practical implementation aspects of reinforcement learning. Key topics covered in the course likely include Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, temporal difference learning, function approximation, policy gradient methods, and deep reinforcement learning. The course is designed for students with a background in computer science, mathematics, and machine learning.</p>
