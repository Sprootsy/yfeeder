  <p>The article "NASA Is Worth Saving" by Casey Handmer argues for the continued importance and funding of NASA, highlighting its unique role in fostering technological innovation, scientific discovery, and international cooperation. The author contends that NASA's value extends far beyond space exploration, impacting various sectors, including telecommunications, materials science, and medicine, through its research and development efforts.</p>
  <p>Handmer addresses common criticisms against NASA, such as its perceived high cost and the argument that private companies can now handle space activities. He counters these claims by emphasizing that NASA's fundamental research and long-term vision are crucial for pushing the boundaries of what's possible, something that private companies, driven by profit motives and shorter-term goals, are less likely to prioritize. NASA's ability to undertake high-risk, high-reward projects that may not have immediate commercial applications is also highlighted.</p>
  <p>The author also points out the critical role NASA plays in planetary science and climate research. NASA's Earth-observing satellites provide invaluable data for understanding climate change, weather patterns, and environmental changes, which are essential for informed policymaking and addressing global challenges. These activities are often undervalued but are vital for the well-being of the planet.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the article argues that NASA's missions inspire future generations of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians, contributing to a highly skilled workforce essential for economic competitiveness. The excitement generated by space exploration and scientific discoveries fuels interest in STEM fields and encourages students to pursue careers in these areas. NASA also fosters international collaboration through its space missions and research projects, promoting diplomacy and shared goals among nations.</p>
  <p>Handmer also touches on the potential for NASA to address future challenges, such as asteroid defense, resource utilization in space, and the development of advanced technologies for sustainable living. These long-term goals require the sustained investment and expertise that only a government agency like NASA can provide.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, the author advocates for continued and even increased funding for NASA, emphasizing its multifaceted benefits to society, the economy, and the environment. NASA's unique capabilities, long-term vision, and ability to inspire make it an invaluable asset that is worth preserving and supporting.</p>
