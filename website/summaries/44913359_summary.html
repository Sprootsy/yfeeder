<p>Paul Graham's essay "Do Things that Don't Scale" argues that startups should initially focus on providing exceptional, personalized service to a small number of users, even if it means doing things that are not scalable in the long run. This hands-on approach allows founders to deeply understand their users' needs, build a strong foundation of passionate customers, and refine their product before attempting to scale. Graham emphasizes that many successful startups started with non-scalable tactics, such as manually onboarding users, personally addressing their concerns, and even building parts of the product themselves. These efforts, while time-consuming, are crucial for gaining early traction and iterating on the product based on real-world feedback. By prioritizing quality over efficiency in the early stages, startups can create a loyal customer base and develop a product that truly resonates with their target audience. Once they have a solid foundation, they can then focus on scaling their operations and automating processes.</p>
