The article recounts the early days of Pixar, from its origins as a computer graphics division within Lucasfilm to its eventual independence and groundbreaking success in animated filmmaking. It highlights the key figures, challenges, and technological innovations that shaped the company.
</p>
<p>
The story begins with George Lucas's vision of using computer graphics in filmmaking. He hired Ed Catmull, a computer scientist, to lead the computer division at Lucasfilm. Catmull assembled a team of talented individuals, including Alvy Ray Smith, and they focused on developing cutting-edge computer graphics technology. Their initial goal was to create tools that would allow filmmakers to create special effects more efficiently.
</p>
<p>
One of the early challenges was the limited computing power available at the time. The team had to develop innovative algorithms and techniques to overcome these limitations. They made significant breakthroughs in areas such as rendering, modeling, and animation. One of the notable achievements was the development of the REYES rendering algorithm, which allowed for the creation of highly detailed and realistic images.
</p>
<p>
Despite their technological advancements, the computer division struggled to find a clear direction and generate revenue within Lucasfilm. George Lucas's divorce and financial difficulties led him to consider selling the division. Steve Jobs, who had been ousted from Apple, saw an opportunity to invest in the company. In 1986, Jobs acquired the computer division from Lucasfilm for $10 million and renamed it Pixar.
</p>
<p>
Under Jobs' leadership, Pixar initially focused on selling its high-end computer, the Pixar Image Computer. However, the computer was not commercially successful. Pixar then shifted its focus to creating short animated films to showcase its technology. These short films, such as "Luxo Jr." and "Tin Toy," were groundbreaking and received critical acclaim, demonstrating the potential of computer animation.

<p>
The success of the short films led to a partnership with Disney to create a full-length animated feature film. This collaboration resulted in "Toy Story," which was released in 1995 and became a massive commercial and critical success. "Toy Story" revolutionized the animation industry and established Pixar as a major player in Hollywood.

The article also touches on the company's culture, emphasizing the importance of collaboration, innovation, and a commitment to excellence. It highlights the unique blend of artistic and technical talent that made Pixar so successful. The studio fostered an environment where creativity and technology could thrive, resulting in a string of critically acclaimed and commercially successful films.
