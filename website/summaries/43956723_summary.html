<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The article "Burrito Now, Pay Later" discusses the increasing trend of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services in the context of everyday purchases, even for items as small as a burrito. It explores the potential benefits and risks associated with using BNPL for such transactions.</p>

<p>The article highlights that while BNPL services offer convenience and the ability to spread out payments over time, making purchases more accessible, they can also lead to overspending and debt accumulation, especially when used for non-essential items. The author emphasizes the ease with which consumers can sign up for and use these services, often without fully understanding the terms and conditions, including interest rates and late fees.</p>

<p>The piece also touches on the appeal of BNPL to younger demographics who may not have access to traditional credit cards or who prefer the perceived simplicity and transparency of BNPL options. However, it cautions that this ease of access can be a double-edged sword, potentially leading to financial difficulties if not managed responsibly.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the article suggests that the proliferation of BNPL services is driven by both consumer demand for flexible payment options and retailers seeking to increase sales. The fees charged to merchants by BNPL providers are often lower than traditional credit card fees, making it an attractive option for businesses. However, the author warns that the long-term impact of BNPL on consumer spending habits and financial well-being remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The article ends by urging consumers to exercise caution and consider the true cost of using BNPL services, particularly for small, discretionary purchases. It advises readers to carefully review the terms and conditions, track their spending, and avoid accumulating debt that they cannot afford to repay.</p>
