  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
   The article, "A Case Study in Bad Hiring Practice and How to Fix It," by Tom Kranz, discusses the pitfalls of a flawed hiring process based on subjective assessments and biases, leading to poor hiring decisions. It presents a scenario where a company consistently hires individuals who underperform, despite the perceived qualifications and charisma displayed during interviews. Kranz argues that relying on "gut feelings" and superficial qualities, such as likeability and confidence, rather than objective, skill-based assessments, results in mismatches between the role's requirements and the candidate's actual capabilities.

   The author uses the example of hiring developers, where the ability to code and solve problems is paramount, but interviewers are often swayed by candidates who present themselves well but lack the necessary technical skills. This results in a team composed of individuals who are good at interviewing but not necessarily good at performing the job. This leads to decreased productivity, increased employee turnover, and a generally demoralized work environment.

   Kranz proposes a shift towards a more structured and objective hiring process to address these issues. He emphasizes the importance of defining clear job requirements and desired skills beforehand. He recommends using standardized assessments and tests to evaluate candidates' abilities objectively. This could include coding challenges, problem-solving exercises, or simulations relevant to the role. He advises focusing on past performance and demonstrable skills rather than relying solely on personality or perceived potential.

   The article also highlights the need for a diverse interview panel to reduce individual biases and ensure a more well-rounded evaluation of candidates. Each interviewer should have a specific area of focus, and their feedback should be based on objective criteria. By implementing these changes, Kranz suggests companies can create a more reliable and effective hiring process, leading to better hiring decisions and a more productive and successful workforce. Ultimately, the article is a call to move away from subjective hiring practices and towards a data-driven approach that prioritizes skills and demonstrable abilities over superficial qualities.
