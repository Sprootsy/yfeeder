<h3>Summary</h3>
The article chronicles Amber Williams' journey of building a personal knowledge management system (PKMS) tailored to her specific needs and preferences. Dissatisfied with existing tools like Notion, Obsidian, and Capacities due to their limitations in handling interconnected ideas and fostering organic thought development, she decided to create her own solution from scratch.

Her initial approach involved leveraging tools she was already familiar with: Google Docs and Google Sheets. Google Docs served as the primary space for writing and developing ideas, while Google Sheets was used to create a structured index or directory to link and organize these documents. This rudimentary system addressed her immediate need for connecting related thoughts and information.

However, this initial setup had drawbacks. The manual process of creating and maintaining links within Google Sheets became cumbersome and time-consuming. The lack of a visual representation of the knowledge network also hindered the ability to easily explore connections between ideas.

Recognizing these limitations, Amber transitioned to a more sophisticated approach using a combination of a local folder structure, Obsidian for writing and linking notes in Markdown format, and Dendron for enhanced hierarchical organization and publishing capabilities. Obsidian provided the flexibility and simplicity she desired for writing and linking notes, while Dendron offered a robust framework for structuring and managing a large collection of notes.

With this improved system, Amber was able to create a more interconnected and navigable knowledge base. She emphasized the importance of consistent naming conventions and linking strategies to ensure the discoverability and coherence of her notes. Furthermore, she highlighted the value of Dendron's publishing features, which allowed her to easily share selected portions of her PKMS with others.

Despite the improvements, Amber acknowledged that her PKMS was still a work in progress. She continued to explore new features and functionalities to optimize her workflow and enhance the overall effectiveness of her system. Her journey underscores the importance of customization and experimentation in finding a PKMS that truly meets one's individual needs.

The article serves as a personal account of the iterative process of building a PKMS, highlighting the challenges and triumphs along the way. It offers valuable insights and inspiration for anyone seeking to create their own personalized system for managing and connecting knowledge. It underscores the idea that the "best" PKMS is often the one that is most closely aligned with one's individual workflow and cognitive style.
