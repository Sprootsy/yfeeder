The book, "Apprentice in Wonderland: How Donald Trump and Mark Zuckerberg Broke Democracy," details an incident where Zuckerberg requested direct access to the Oval Office to communicate with Trump, bypassing standard security protocols. Despite objections from some advisors who raised concerns about the lack of security screening and potential vulnerabilities, Trump allegedly granted Zuckerberg's request. This decision allowed Zuckerberg to have a dedicated line to the president, raising questions about influence and potential conflicts of interest.</p>
