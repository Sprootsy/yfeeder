    The article highlights several key features of Mistral Code. First, the models support long context windows, enabling them to handle larger codebases and more complex tasks by considering more information at once. Mistral Code Medium has a 32K token context window, while Mistral Code Small has a 8K token context window. Second, they demonstrate proficiency in multiple programming languages, covering both popular and niche languages. The article mentions Python, Java, JavaScript, Typescript, C++, C#, and Go as examples. Third, both models support fill-in-the-middle (FIM) capabilities, allowing them to seamlessly integrate into IDEs and assist with completing code blocks within existing code. Finally, Mistral AI asserts that these models are designed to be easily customizable, enabling developers to fine-tune them on their own data to optimize performance for specific tasks and domains.
