SomaFM is celebrating its 25th anniversary. The internet radio station, founded by Rusty Hodge, began broadcasting on February 9, 1999, from a spare bedroom. It started with a focus on electronic music that wasn't being played on terrestrial radio, with early channels like Groove Salad, Drone Zone, and Lush.

The station's early years were marked by technical challenges and financial constraints. The initial setup involved running the station from a Macintosh G3 and utilizing now-defunct streaming audio software. Funding came from Rusty Hodge's savings and whatever he could cobble together.

SomaFM has maintained its independence, refusing to sell out to larger media conglomerates, which is a core part of its identity. This independence has allowed it to maintain its unique musical curation and avoid the homogenization common in corporate radio.

Listener support has been crucial to SomaFM's survival. The station relies on donations, subscriptions, and merchandise sales. The article emphasizes that SomaFM is truly listener-supported and has remained so for its entire existence.

Over the years, SomaFM has expanded its offerings to include a diverse range of channels, each with its own distinct musical style. The station's website and mobile apps provide access to these channels, as well as information about the music being played.
