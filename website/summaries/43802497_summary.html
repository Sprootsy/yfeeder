        <h1>Mark Zuckerberg personally lost the Facebook antitrust case</h1>

 <h3>Summary</h3>
 The article discusses the increasing trend of tech CEOs, particularly Mark Zuckerberg, engaging more directly and chattily with the public through various online platforms. It critiques the idea that this newfound accessibility equates to genuine transparency or accountability. Cory Doctorow, the author, argues that these carefully managed public appearances serve primarily as a PR strategy to shape public perception and deflect criticism, rather than offering meaningful insight into the company's decisions or addressing substantive concerns. The piece highlights the disjunction between the friendly, relatable persona tech CEOs try to project and the often-detrimental impacts of their companies' policies and actions. Doctorow suggests that this shift towards chatty CEOs is a tactic to normalize their power and influence, making it more difficult to hold them accountable for the harms caused by their platforms. The article ultimately urges readers to be critical of these PR efforts and to demand genuine transparency and accountability from tech leaders.
