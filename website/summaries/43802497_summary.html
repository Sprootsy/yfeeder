<p>The article discusses the implications of Meta's increasing openness and engagement with external developers and creators, particularly in the context of its AI development efforts. It contrasts Meta's current strategy with its historical reputation for being closed off and controlling, especially concerning its past treatment of developers who built on its platforms. The shift is framed as a potentially positive development, especially given the power and influence Meta wields. However, the author expresses skepticism and concern, drawing parallels with past instances where tech companies initially courted developers only to later exploit or abandon them.</p>

<p>The core argument centers around the risks associated with trusting powerful platforms like Meta, even when they appear to be acting in a more collaborative and open manner. The author highlights the inherent power imbalance between a massive corporation and independent creators, suggesting that Meta's apparent generosity could be a calculated move to consolidate its dominance in the AI space. By inviting developers to build on its infrastructure, Meta gains access to their creativity, innovation, and data, potentially using these assets to further its own objectives, possibly at the expense of the developers themselves. The article invokes the concept of "enshittification," where platforms initially provide benefits to users and partners but gradually degrade these benefits to extract more value for themselves.</p>

<p>The article also touches on the broader context of AI development and the concentration of power in the hands of a few large tech companies. The author suggests that true democratization of AI requires a more decentralized and open ecosystem, one that is not controlled by a handful of corporate giants. The author cautions against blindly trusting Meta's newfound openness, urging developers and policymakers to carefully consider the potential consequences of allowing such a powerful entity to control a significant portion of the AI landscape.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the article presents a cautionary tale about the dangers of platform dependence and the importance of maintaining a healthy skepticism towards large tech companies, even when they appear to be offering a helping hand. The author advocates for a more balanced and equitable approach to AI development, one that prioritizes the interests of creators and the public over the profits of corporations.</p>
