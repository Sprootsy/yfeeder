<h3>Summary:</h3>
The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) provides guidance on the appropriate use of telephone numbers in television shows, films, and other creative works. The core issue is the potential for real people to be harassed or inconvenienced when fictional telephone numbers displayed in media happen to match or become reassigned to real-world numbers. The ACMA outlines the risks associated with using real or realistic-looking phone numbers and recommends strategies to mitigate these risks. These strategies include using specific number ranges that are designated as invalid, such as the '555' prefix in North America (though its availability varies internationally and is not universally invalid), or altering numbers sufficiently to ensure they are not functional. The guide emphasizes the importance of production companies and content creators taking responsibility for preventing unintended consequences arising from the use of telephone numbers in their productions. It advises conducting thorough checks to ensure that displayed numbers are not currently in service and will not be in the future. The ACMA also highlights the legal considerations surrounding privacy and potential liability for nuisance calls or harassment resulting from the misuse of telephone numbers. The document serves as a practical resource for the Australian media industry, aiming to balance creative freedom with the need to protect the public from potential harm and inconvenience. The ACMA encourages a proactive approach to number selection and modification to avoid unintended real-world impacts.
