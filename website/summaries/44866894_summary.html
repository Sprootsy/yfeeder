  <p>According to Dan Kennedy's article, the Associated Press (AP) has informed its book critics that it is discontinuing its weekly book reviews. Kennedy expresses disappointment with this decision, highlighting the importance of book reviews in the literary ecosystem. He suggests that the AP's decision reflects a broader trend of declining investment in arts and culture journalism, potentially impacting authors, publishers, and readers. While the AP will continue to cover books through author interviews and news articles, the absence of regular, critical reviews is seen as a loss for the literary community.</p>
