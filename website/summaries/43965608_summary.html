    <h2>HealthBench â€“ An evaluation for AI systems and human health</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p>HealthBench is a new OpenAI project designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to reason through complex healthcare scenarios. The project encompasses a suite of datasets and benchmarks covering various aspects of healthcare, including clinical reasoning, medical knowledge, and understanding of healthcare-related tasks. The aim is to provide a standardized and rigorous way to assess and compare the performance of different LLMs in the healthcare domain. The project is still a work in progress and OpenAI plans to actively expand and refine the HealthBench suite.</p>
