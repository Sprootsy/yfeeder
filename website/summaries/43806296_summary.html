        <p>
<div>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The provided text is a GitHub repository README file for Tilt, a tool designed to streamline the development workflow for Kubernetes and other container-based applications. Tilt aims to make local development feel more like production, enabling developers to iterate quickly and efficiently on their applications without the delays and complexities typically associated with deploying to Kubernetes. It addresses common pain points such as slow builds, difficult debugging, and discrepancies between local and remote environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tilt works by monitoring your source code for changes and automatically rebuilding and redeploying your application to a local or remote Kubernetes cluster. It provides features like live updates, allowing changes to be reflected in the running application almost instantly. It also offers a web-based user interface that displays logs, status information, and other relevant data, making it easier to monitor and debug your application. Tilt supports various programming languages and frameworks, and can be customized to fit specific project requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    The README file provides a comprehensive overview of Tilt's features, installation instructions, usage examples, and links to further documentation. It highlights the benefits of using Tilt, such as faster iteration cycles, improved developer productivity, and reduced risk of errors during deployment. The document also explains how Tilt integrates with other tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem, such as Docker, Helm, and Skaffold.
  </p>
  <p>
    The target audience for Tilt includes developers, DevOps engineers, and anyone involved in building and deploying containerized applications. The tool is particularly useful for teams that are adopting Kubernetes and want to improve their development workflow.
