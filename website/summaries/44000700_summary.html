    <h2>NASA keeps ancient Voyager 1 spacecraft alive with Hail Mary thruster fix</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Voyager 1, NASA's long-lived spacecraft, is continuing its mission beyond our solar system thanks to a clever workaround devised by engineers. The spacecraft, which has been exploring interstellar space for over a decade, had been experiencing issues with its attitude control system, specifically the thrusters used to keep its antenna pointed towards Earth. These thrusters had degraded over time, requiring more power to operate and threatening the spacecraft's ability to communicate effectively. Engineers discovered that they could use an alternative set of thrusters, the Trajectory Correction Maneuver (TCM) thrusters, which had been dormant for 43 years. After extensive analysis and testing, a plan was devised to activate these thrusters and use them for attitude control. The switch was executed successfully, and Voyager 1 is now using the TCM thrusters to maintain its orientation. This fix is expected to extend the spacecraft's operational lifespan by several years, allowing it to continue collecting valuable data from interstellar space.</p>
