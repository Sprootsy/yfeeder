  <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been building a surveillance system along the U.S.-Mexico border that includes cameras, sensors, and license plate readers, according to government documents and interviews. This system collects vast amounts of data on people crossing the border, including U.S. citizens, without their knowledge or consent. The surveillance data is shared with other law enforcement agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), raising concerns about privacy and civil liberties.</p>
  
  <p>The program, known as the Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR) program, has been expanded significantly in recent years, with hundreds of new cameras and sensors installed along the border. The data collected by these devices is stored in a central database that can be accessed by DHS officials and other law enforcement agencies. The system is designed to track the movement of people and vehicles across the border, but it also captures data on people who are not suspected of any wrongdoing.</p>
  
  <p>Critics of the program argue that it is an invasion of privacy and that it violates the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. They also argue that the data collected by the program could be used to target minority communities and to deport people who are not authorized to be in the United States. DHS officials defend the program, saying that it is necessary to secure the border and to protect national security. They also say that the data collected by the program is used only to investigate criminal activity and to enforce immigration laws.</p>
  
  <p>Some examples of how the technology is used include:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Tracking vehicles entering and exiting the United States</li>
   <li>Identifying individuals who may be involved in criminal activity</li>
   <li>Enforcing immigration laws</li>
  </ul>
