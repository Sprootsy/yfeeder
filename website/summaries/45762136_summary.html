   The article analyzes Moderna's trajectory, from its pandemic-fueled rise to its subsequent challenges and the broader implications for the mRNA technology platform. It recounts Moderna's initial struggles, including skepticism about its mRNA technology and its lack of approved products before the Covid-19 pandemic. The rapid development and success of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine catapulted the company into the spotlight, generating immense revenue and validating the mRNA approach.

   However, the article highlights the difficulties Moderna has faced in sustaining its growth beyond the pandemic. Sales of the Covid-19 vaccine have declined significantly, and the company has yet to bring other mRNA products to market. The piece examines the complexities of developing and manufacturing mRNA therapeutics, including challenges related to delivery, stability, and the immune response. Competition in the mRNA space is also intensifying, with other companies like BioNTech and established pharmaceutical giants pursuing their own mRNA programs.
