        <h1>Business co-founders in tech startups are less valuable than they think</h1>

  <h3>Summary:</h3>
  <p>
    The article "Business Founders Are Less Valuable Than They Think" by Verdinandia Puku argues that while founders are crucial in the initial stages of a company, their value often diminishes as the company grows. The author contends that many founders overestimate their long-term importance and struggle to adapt to the changing needs of the organization.

  <p>
    The article suggests that the skills and qualities that make someone a successful founder—such as risk-taking, vision, and a "do-whatever-it-takes" attitude—can become liabilities as the company scales. As a company matures, it requires different skills, such as structured management, delegation, and strategic planning. Founders who cling to their initial roles and resist bringing in experienced managers may hinder the company's growth.

    The piece also addresses the emotional attachment founders have to their companies, often leading to difficulties in letting go of control or accepting alternative viewpoints. This attachment can result in founders making suboptimal decisions or resisting necessary changes. The author suggests that founders should be self-aware and willing to step aside or redefine their roles as the company evolves, potentially transitioning to advisory positions or focusing on new ventures.

    The article emphasizes that a successful company needs a team of skilled individuals, and the founder's initial vision needs to be complemented by the expertise of others. The author implies that recognizing one's limitations and being open to change are essential for both the founder's personal growth and the company's long-term success. Failure to do so can lead to stagnation, internal conflicts, and ultimately, the company's underperformance.
