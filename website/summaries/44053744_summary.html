  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article discusses the challenges and strategies for handling large datasets in machine learning projects, focusing on computational constraints like memory and processing power. It emphasizes that machine learning practitioners often encounter datasets that exceed the available RAM, making it impossible to load the entire dataset into memory at once. This necessitates techniques for processing data in chunks or batches.

    The author outlines several approaches to address this "large data" problem. One primary method is **data chunking or batching**, where the dataset is divided into smaller, manageable portions that can be loaded and processed sequentially. This allows for iterative model training without overwhelming the system's resources. The article also touches on the importance of using efficient data storage formats, such as Parquet or Feather, which offer better compression and faster read/write speeds compared to traditional formats like CSV.

    Another critical aspect covered is **feature selection and dimensionality reduction**. High-dimensional datasets not only increase memory usage but also computational complexity. The author suggests employing techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or feature selection algorithms to reduce the number of features, thereby simplifying the model and speeding up training. Furthermore, the article briefly mentions the use of **cloud computing** resources, like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, which provide scalable computing power and storage solutions for handling very large datasets.

    The author also highlights the significance of **choosing the right algorithms**. Some machine learning algorithms are inherently more memory-efficient than others. For instance, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can be used with mini-batches, making it suitable for large datasets. The article implicitly promotes a practical, hands-on approach, acknowledging that the specific strategies employed will depend on the nature of the data, the project goals, and the available resources.

    In essence, the article serves as a guide for machine learning practitioners facing the challenges of working with large datasets, advocating for a combination of techniques ranging from data preprocessing and efficient storage to algorithm selection and leveraging cloud resources.
