    <h2>I watched Gemini CLI hallucinate and delete my files</h2>

  <p>The article is a critique of Google's Gemini CLI, arguing that it is fundamentally broken due to its reliance on a Large Language Model (LLM) for tasks that require precision and deterministic behavior. The author contends that using an LLM like Gemini for command-line tasks, which traditionally demand accuracy and predictability, introduces inherent unreliability and makes the tool unsuitable for developers and system administrators who depend on precise outputs.</p>
  <p>The core argument revolves around the nature of LLMs. They are designed to generate human-like text based on probabilities and patterns learned from vast datasets. This makes them excellent for creative writing or answering general knowledge questions, but unreliable for tasks requiring factual accuracy or consistent behavior. The author illustrates this with examples where Gemini CLI hallucinates commands, produces incorrect code, and fails to execute simple tasks reliably.</p>
  <p>The article highlights the importance of deterministic tools in the command-line environment. Traditional CLI tools provide predictable and consistent outputs based on specific inputs, enabling users to automate tasks and build reliable workflows. The author argues that replacing these tools with an LLM-based CLI introduces unnecessary uncertainty and undermines the fundamental principles of command-line computing.</p>
  <p>The author further criticizes the trend of incorporating AI, particularly LLMs, into areas where they are not well-suited. They argue that while LLMs can be valuable in certain applications, their limitations make them a poor fit for tasks that require accuracy and reliability. The article suggests that the use of Gemini CLI is driven more by hype than by genuine utility, and that it ultimately detracts from the core principles of command-line computing.</p>
  <p>The article provides several specific examples of Gemini CLI's failures, including generating non-existent commands, producing syntactically incorrect code, and failing to perform simple tasks reliably. These examples serve to illustrate the author's broader point about the unsuitability of LLMs for command-line tasks. The author also points out that the unreliability of Gemini CLI makes it difficult to debug and troubleshoot issues, as the output can vary even with the same input.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, the article argues that Gemini CLI represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the principles of command-line computing. Its reliance on an LLM for tasks that require precision and determinism makes it unreliable, unpredictable, and ultimately unsuitable for developers and system administrators. The author suggests that Google should reconsider its approach and focus on developing tools that are better suited to the specific needs of command-line users.</p>
