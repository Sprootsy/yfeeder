<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The article "The Fetching" by Carson Gross discusses the modern web development trend of building user interfaces (UIs) primarily with JavaScript, often relying on complex frameworks and client-side rendering. The author argues that this approach, which he terms "The Fetching," has led to unnecessary complexity, performance issues, and a disconnect from the core principles of the web.</p>

<p>Gross explains that "The Fetching" involves fetching data from a server using JavaScript, often via APIs, and then rendering the UI on the client-side. This contrasts with the traditional server-side rendering (SSR) approach where the server generates HTML that is sent directly to the browser. He contends that while SSR may seem outdated, it offers advantages in terms of initial page load time, SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and overall simplicity.</p>

<p>The author criticizes the complexity introduced by JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, which often require developers to learn new concepts, tooling, and patterns. He suggests that these frameworks, while powerful, are not always necessary for building simple, interactive web applications. He posits that the shift towards client-side rendering was partly driven by a desire for richer, more dynamic UIs, but argues that many of the benefits can be achieved using simpler techniques.</p>

<p>He advocates for a return to server-side rendering for many use cases, supplemented with lightweight JavaScript for enhancing interactivity. He also promotes the use of technologies like HTMX, which allows developers to add AJAX-like functionality to HTML elements using simple attributes, without writing extensive JavaScript code. HTMX enables developers to trigger HTTP requests based on user interactions and replace parts of the DOM (Document Object Model) with the server's response.</p>

<p>The article further explores the trade-offs between client-side and server-side rendering, acknowledging that client-side rendering can be appropriate for certain types of applications, such as highly interactive single-page applications (SPAs) or applications that require offline functionality. However, he emphasizes that for many web applications, the benefits of SSR outweigh the costs, especially when combined with tools like HTMX that simplify the development of interactive features.</p>

<p>In essence, Gross makes a case for a more balanced approach to web development, where developers carefully consider the trade-offs between client-side and server-side rendering and choose the approach that best suits the specific needs of their application. He argues that "The Fetching" has become the default approach without sufficient consideration, and that many web applications could benefit from a simpler, more server-centric architecture.</p>
