  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article is a personal reflection on the author's career path and how it deviated from their initial expectations. It begins by outlining the common societal narrative about career progression: graduate, get a stable job, climb the corporate ladder, and eventually retire. The author initially aimed for this conventional path, securing internships and a full-time offer at a large company after graduation. However, they quickly realized that this environment didn't align with their desire for continuous learning and rapid skill development.

    The author describes feeling stagnant and unchallenged in their first role, which led them to seek out opportunities for growth outside of work, such as learning new programming languages and contributing to open-source projects. This pursuit of knowledge eventually led them to a startup, where they experienced a much faster-paced and more dynamic work environment. They emphasize the steep learning curve and the constant need to adapt and acquire new skills in a startup setting.

    The article then reflects on the author's decision to leave the startup after a couple of years to work at a large tech company. This move was driven by a desire for better work-life balance and the opportunity to work on more impactful projects with a larger user base. While the large company offered stability and resources, it also presented new challenges, such as navigating complex organizational structures and dealing with bureaucracy.

    The author also discusses the importance of continuous learning and adapting to new technologies throughout their career. They highlight the need to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving industry and to be proactive in seeking out opportunities for professional development.

    Ultimately, the article concludes that there is no single "right" path for everyone. The author's career journey has been characterized by experimentation, adaptation, and a willingness to deviate from the traditional career trajectory. They encourage readers to be open to new experiences, to embrace challenges, and to prioritize their own personal and professional growth.
