<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>William & Mary's Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) has released its annual Sea Level Report Cards, providing updated projections for sea-level rise in the next year and decades for 94 localities along the U.S. coast. These report cards, now in their 17th year, offer accessible and localized information crucial for coastal communities to plan for and adapt to the challenges posed by rising sea levels. The projections are based on the latest data and incorporate historical trends to provide more accurate and nuanced forecasts than global models. Key findings indicate that sea levels continue to rise at varying rates along different parts of the U.S. coastline, with some areas experiencing significantly faster rates than others. The report cards also highlight the increasing frequency of nuisance flooding and emphasize the need for proactive adaptation strategies to mitigate the impacts of sea-level rise on infrastructure, ecosystems, and communities.</p>

<p>The VIMS Sea Level Report Cards stand out due to their localized focus, providing town-specific data that is invaluable for local decision-making. This contrasts with global sea-level projections, which often lack the resolution needed to address the unique challenges faced by individual communities. The report cards use tide-gauge data to project future sea levels and offer year-to-year assessments of sea-level trends, enhancing their utility for short-term and long-term planning. By offering projections out to 2050, the report cards enable communities to anticipate and prepare for the impacts of sea-level rise on infrastructure, property values, and natural resources.</p>

<p>The report cards also emphasize the importance of considering different climate change scenarios, as future sea-level rise will depend on the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions. By providing a range of projections based on various emission scenarios, the report cards allow communities to assess the potential risks and uncertainties associated with sea-level rise. This information is critical for developing robust adaptation plans that can accommodate a range of possible future conditions.</p>

<p>The annual release of the Sea Level Report Cards underscores VIMS's commitment to providing timely and relevant information to coastal communities. By synthesizing the latest scientific data and translating it into accessible formats, VIMS helps bridge the gap between science and decision-making. The report cards are widely used by coastal managers, policymakers, and other stakeholders to inform planning decisions, prioritize adaptation measures, and communicate the risks of sea-level rise to the public.</p>

<p>In summary, the 2024 Sea Level Report Cards from VIMS offer a valuable tool for coastal communities to understand and respond to the challenges of sea-level rise. By providing localized projections, incorporating historical trends, and emphasizing the importance of adaptation planning, the report cards empower communities to make informed decisions and build resilience in the face of a changing climate.</p>
