    <h2>CJEU has made it effectively impossible to run a user-generated platform legally</h2>

  <p>According to the article, the EU's top court has made it essentially impossible to legally operate a user-generated content platform. The ruling in question deals with copyright law and the obligations of platforms that host user-uploaded content. The author argues that the court's interpretation of EU copyright law places an unrealistic and potentially insurmountable burden on these platforms, effectively requiring them to pre-emptively filter and monitor all user uploads for potential copyright infringements.</p>
  <p>The core issue revolves around the concept of "communication to the public" under EU copyright law. The court has apparently broadened the definition of this concept to include platforms that merely provide the infrastructure for users to share content, even if the platforms themselves do not actively select or endorse the content. This means that platforms are now directly liable for copyright infringements committed by their users, even if they are unaware of the infringement.</p>
  <p>To avoid liability, platforms would need to implement comprehensive monitoring systems capable of identifying and removing infringing content before it is even made available to the public. The author emphasizes that such systems are technically challenging, expensive to implement, and prone to errors, potentially leading to the removal of legitimate content. Furthermore, they raise concerns about the impact on freedom of speech and the potential for censorship, as platforms may err on the side of caution and remove content that is arguably lawful.</p>
  <p>The article criticizes the court's decision for failing to adequately consider the practical realities of running a user-generated content platform. It argues that the ruling ignores the sheer volume of content uploaded to these platforms every day, making it impossible to manually review every submission. The author suggests that the court's approach is overly focused on protecting copyright holders at the expense of innovation, free expression, and the interests of the general public.</p>
  <p>The article concludes that the ruling will have a chilling effect on the user-generated content ecosystem in the EU. It predicts that many smaller platforms will be unable to comply with the new requirements and will be forced to shut down. Even larger platforms may be hesitant to invest in new features or expand their services in the EU, fearing the risk of liability. The author suggests that the ruling could ultimately lead to a more centralized and less diverse online environment, with fewer opportunities for users to create and share content.</p>
