  <p>The article in <em>New Scientist</em> discusses the discovery of a new form of magnetism called altermagnetism. Unlike ferromagnets (like iron) where electron spins are aligned, or antiferromagnets where they are aligned in opposite directions, altermagnets feature a more complex spin arrangement dictated by the crystal structure of the material. This results in unique properties, including the potential for faster and more energy-efficient data storage and processing. The discovery was made by Libor Šmejkal at the University of Mainz in Germany, who predicted the existence of altermagnets back in 2021. Further research has identified numerous materials, such as manganese telluride, that exhibit altermagnetism. The spin arrangement in altermagnets allows for spin-polarized currents, which can be utilized in spintronic devices. These devices could potentially outperform traditional electronics, offering advantages in speed and energy consumption. The unique electronic band structure of altermagnets, with alternating spin-up and spin-down electrons, facilitates the creation of these spin-polarized currents. The article also mentions the challenges in detecting and manipulating altermagnetism, as it doesn't produce an external magnetic field like ferromagnets. However, scientists are developing new techniques to overcome these challenges. The potential applications of altermagnets are vast, ranging from high-density memory storage to ultra-fast computing and other advanced technological applications.</p>
