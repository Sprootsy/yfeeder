    <h2>A study of lights at night suggests dictators lie about economic growth (2022)</h2>

    This article from The Economist discusses a study that uses satellite data of nighttime lights to assess the accuracy of economic growth figures reported by authoritarian regimes. The study compares officially reported GDP growth with growth inferred from changes in nighttime light intensity. The underlying assumption is that economic activity is correlated with energy consumption and thus with light emissions at night.

    The researchers found that authoritarian countries tend to overstate their economic growth compared to what is suggested by nighttime light data. The discrepancy is particularly pronounced in countries with weaker institutions and less press freedom, suggesting that these regimes have a greater ability and incentive to manipulate economic data. The study doesn't claim that all authoritarian regimes lie, but rather highlights a systematic tendency to report higher growth rates than what is observable through satellite imagery.

    The study suggests that nighttime light data can serve as a more objective measure of economic activity, especially in contexts where official statistics are unreliable. It can be used to cross-validate official data, identify potential data manipulation, and provide a more accurate picture of economic performance. The study also acknowledges that nighttime light data is not a perfect measure of economic activity, as it may not capture all sectors of the economy equally well (e.g., it might be more strongly correlated with industrial production than with services). Furthermore, changes in energy efficiency or the mix of economic activities can also affect the relationship between economic growth and nighttime light emissions. Nevertheless, the study's findings have important implications for investors, policymakers, and researchers who rely on economic data from authoritarian countries.

    The article emphasizes the potential of using alternative data sources, such as satellite imagery, to improve the reliability of economic assessments, particularly in environments where data transparency and accountability are limited.
