    <h2>Google shifts goo.gl policy: Inactive links deactivated, active links preserved</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p>Google is updating its link shortening service, goo.gl, which was initially launched in 2009 to help share links more easily and track their usage. The service is being transitioned to focus on supporting developers managing Firebase Dynamic Links (FDL). FDLs are smart URLs that allow sending existing and potential users to the right place within an iOS, Android or web app. This could be either the app store to download the app or directly to a specific location within the app, depending on whether the user has already installed it.</p>

<p>Starting May 30, 2018, only existing users of the goo.gl URL shortener will be able to create new short links through the goo.gl console. Anonymous or new users will no longer be able to create new short links via the goo.gl website. However, all existing goo.gl short links will continue to redirect to their intended destinations. The goo.gl console will remain available for existing users to manage their short links and view analytics data for a period of one year, until May 30, 2019.</p>

<p>Developers are encouraged to migrate to Firebase Dynamic Links (FDL) for deep linking capabilities, which are specifically designed for mobile app use cases. FDLs offer features like surviving the app installation process, allowing users to be directed to the right content even after installing the app. For general-purpose URL shortening, developers and users are recommended to consider alternatives such as Bitly or Ow.ly.</p>

<p>The update reflects Google's strategy to focus goo.gl's link shortening technology on Firebase Dynamic Links, providing a more robust and feature-rich solution for app developers needing deep linking functionality. The announcement emphasizes that while goo.gl served its purpose well, the needs of developers have evolved, necessitating a shift towards more sophisticated deep linking solutions. Therefore, Google recommends alternative services for those who only require basic link shortening.</p>
