  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The article, "When the Machine Stops" by Ibrahima Diallo, explores the potential consequences of over-reliance on technology and the erosion of human skills and connection in a technologically advanced future. Drawing inspiration from E.M. Forster's short story of the same name, Diallo reflects on the increasing dependence on automated systems and the diminishing capacity for humans to perform basic tasks or think critically without technological assistance. The author posits that while technology offers convenience and efficiency, it can also lead to a dangerous level of complacency and a loss of essential human capabilities. The article delves into various aspects of this dependency, including the decline of practical skills, the impact on cognitive abilities, and the potential for social isolation. It suggests that a future where humans are entirely reliant on machines could be fragile, as any system failure could trigger widespread chaos and a collapse of societal functions. The author warns against the uncritical embrace of technology and advocates for a balanced approach that preserves human skills, fosters critical thinking, and maintains genuine human connections. The piece also emphasizes the importance of resilience and adaptability in the face of technological disruptions, arguing that maintaining a degree of self-sufficiency and the ability to function independently of machines is crucial for navigating an uncertain future. Diallo encourages readers to reflect on their relationship with technology and to consider the long-term implications of outsourcing essential tasks and cognitive functions to automated systems. The article concludes with a call to action, urging individuals to cultivate skills, nurture relationships, and maintain a critical perspective on the role of technology in their lives to avoid a future where humanity is rendered helpless by its own creations.</p>
