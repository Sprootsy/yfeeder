    This is a philosophical essay by Lawrence Paulson discussing the nature of dependent type theory and its applicability as a foundation for mathematics and computer science. The author argues against the notion that everything should be done using dependent types, presenting counterarguments and highlighting the practical limitations and complexities that arise from its pervasive use.

    The article begins by acknowledging the appeal of dependent type theory, which allows types to depend on values, leading to more precise specifications and stronger guarantees. However, the author challenges the idea that this precision is always necessary or beneficial. He posits that while dependent types are powerful, they also introduce significant overhead in terms of reasoning, proof complexity, and computational cost. A central theme is the trade-off between absolute correctness and practical manageability.

    Paulson critiques the tendency to view any deviation from dependent typing as a weakness or a compromise. He advocates for a more pragmatic approach, suggesting that simpler type systems and logics are often sufficient and more appropriate for many tasks. He emphasizes that traditional mathematical practice and many areas of computer science have thrived without relying on the full power of dependent types. The author uses examples to illustrate how seemingly straightforward concepts can become overly complicated when expressed using dependent types.

    The article delves into the challenges of working with dependent types in practice. It discusses the difficulties in type checking, type inference, and equational reasoning. The author points out that dependent type systems often require significant manual effort to guide the type checker and resolve ambiguities. He also notes that the computational complexity of dependent type checking can be a significant barrier to scalability.

    Furthermore, Paulson raises concerns about the readability and maintainability of code written using dependent types. He argues that the increased complexity can make it harder for developers to understand and modify the code, potentially leading to errors and hindering collaboration. He suggests that simpler, more conventional approaches can often lead to more robust and maintainable systems.

    The author explores alternative approaches to achieving correctness and reliability. He highlights the importance of testing, static analysis, and other verification techniques. He argues that these methods, while not providing the same level of formal guarantee as dependent types, can be more cost-effective and practical for many real-world applications. Paulson suggests that a balanced approach, combining different techniques based on the specific needs of the project, is often the most effective strategy.

    In conclusion, the article advocates for a nuanced perspective on dependent type theory. While acknowledging its power and potential, it cautions against its indiscriminate use. The author emphasizes the importance of considering the trade-offs between correctness, complexity, and practicality. He encourages researchers and practitioners to explore a wider range of techniques for achieving reliable software and formalizing mathematics, rather than solely relying on dependent types.
