<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The article discusses a massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack launched by a botnet named "Aisuru" that targeted several U.S. Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The attack, which took place in October 2024, involved a record-breaking volume of malicious traffic, surpassing previous DDoS attack records. The Aisuru botnet is composed of compromised IoT devices, particularly routers and other networking equipment, and its operators exploited vulnerabilities to amass a substantial number of bots. </p>
<p>The attack leveraged multiple DDoS techniques to overwhelm the ISPs' infrastructure, leading to significant disruptions in internet services for customers across various regions. The motivation behind the attack remains unclear, but it is speculated that it could be linked to extortion attempts, political activism, or simply a demonstration of the botnet's capabilities.</p>
<p>Security experts are investigating the Aisuru botnet to identify its command-and-control infrastructure and the vulnerabilities exploited to compromise devices. The incident highlights the growing threat posed by IoT botnets and the importance of implementing robust security measures to protect devices from being recruited into such networks. The article emphasizes the need for ISPs and device manufacturers to collaborate in addressing the vulnerabilities that enable these attacks and to improve the overall security of the internet ecosystem.</p>
