  <p>This article discusses the potential of targeting the gut-brain axis (GBA) through nutritional interventions as a therapeutic strategy for managing Parkinson's Disease (PD). PD, primarily known as a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor function, is increasingly recognized to have significant links to the gastrointestinal system. The review explores the bidirectional communication pathways between the gut and the brain, involving the vagus nerve, enteric nervous system, gut microbiota, and various metabolites.</p>
  <p>The article details how gut dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut microbiota composition, is commonly observed in PD patients and can contribute to the disease's pathogenesis. This dysbiosis is associated with increased intestinal permeability ("leaky gut"), inflammation, and altered production of neurotransmitters and other neuroactive substances. These factors can exacerbate the neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration characteristic of PD.</p>
  <p>Specifically, the review highlights the role of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), produced by gut bacteria through the fermentation of dietary fibers, in modulating brain function and neuroinflammation. It also discusses the impact of other microbial metabolites, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), on PD pathology.</p>
  <p>The article then focuses on nutritional interventions that can potentially restore gut homeostasis and positively influence the GBA in PD. These include prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics (a combination of pre- and probiotics), and specific dietary patterns like the Mediterranean diet. Prebiotics, such as inulin and fructooligosaccharides, promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. Probiotics, live microorganisms, can directly introduce beneficial bacteria into the gut. Synbiotics offer a combined approach to improve gut health.</p>
  <p>The Mediterranean diet, rich in fiber, healthy fats, and antioxidants, is presented as a dietary pattern that supports a healthy gut microbiome and reduces inflammation. The ketogenic diet, a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, is also mentioned for its potential neuroprotective effects and influence on the gut microbiota.</p>
  <p>The review emphasizes that while preclinical studies and some clinical trials show promising results, more research is needed to fully understand the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these nutritional interventions in PD. Personalized nutrition strategies, tailored to individual gut microbiota profiles and disease stages, are suggested as a future direction for optimizing therapeutic outcomes. The article concludes by underscoring the importance of considering the gut-brain axis in the management of PD and the potential of nutritional interventions as a complementary approach to traditional therapies.</p>
