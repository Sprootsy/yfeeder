  <p>The Brennan Center report, "Trump Administration's Campaign to Undermine the Next Election," details the actions taken by the Trump administration that aimed to undermine the integrity and fairness of the 2020 election and, more broadly, to erode public trust in the democratic process. The report outlines a multifaceted effort that involved numerous government entities and individuals and was characterized by the spread of disinformation, attacks on mail-in voting, attempts to influence election administration, and the premature declaration of victory. The report asserts that these actions have lasting implications for American democracy and the integrity of future elections.</p>

  <p>The report begins by describing how the Trump administration and its allies promoted false narratives about widespread voter fraud, particularly concerning mail-in voting. These claims were often amplified through social media and conservative news outlets, contributing to a climate of distrust and skepticism about the election's legitimacy. The report emphasizes that these claims were not supported by evidence and were often contradicted by the findings of election officials and experts.</p>

  <p>The report discusses the administration's efforts to interfere with the operations of the United States Postal Service (USPS). These actions, including cost-cutting measures and operational changes implemented by Trump's appointed Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy, led to delays in mail delivery, raising concerns about the timely delivery of mail-in ballots. The report suggests that these actions were deliberate attempts to sabotage mail-in voting, which was expected to be widely used due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

  <p>The report highlights attempts to pressure state and local election officials to conduct audits and investigations into alleged voter fraud. These efforts included direct phone calls from President Trump to election officials in states like Georgia, urging them to "find" votes that would overturn the election results. The report also details the involvement of Trump's campaign in filing lawsuits challenging the election results in several states, although most of these lawsuits were unsuccessful.</p>

  <p>The report also sheds light on the administration's efforts to influence election administration through appointments to key positions. The appointment of individuals with partisan backgrounds to positions within the Department of Justice and other agencies raised concerns about the politicization of election oversight and enforcement.</p>

  <p>Finally, the report addresses the events leading up to and following the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol. The report argues that Trump's repeated claims of a stolen election and his encouragement of supporters to protest the election results played a significant role in inciting the attack. The report also discusses the administration's response to the attack, including the delay in deploying the National Guard to quell the violence.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, the Brennan Center report paints a picture of a sustained and coordinated effort by the Trump administration to undermine the integrity of the 2020 election. The report warns that these actions have had a lasting impact on public trust in democracy and that steps must be taken to prevent similar attempts to undermine future elections.</p>
