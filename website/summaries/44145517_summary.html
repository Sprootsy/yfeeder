    <h2>A Lean companion to Analysis I</h2>

<p>
This blog post by Terry Tao announces the release of a Lean-formalized companion to his textbook "Analysis I" (4th edition). The companion, titled "Analysis_I.lean," is available on GitHub and aims to provide a rigorous, machine-checked formalization of the material covered in the textbook.
</p>
<p>
The primary motivation behind this project is to enhance the learning experience for students and readers of "Analysis I" by offering a completely rigorous and unambiguous presentation of the concepts and proofs. Tao emphasizes that while his textbook strives for precision, there can still be ambiguities or informalities that a formal system like Lean can eliminate. By formalizing the content, the companion ensures that all definitions and proofs are logically sound and complete, leaving no room for interpretation.
</p>
<p>
The "Analysis_I.lean" companion covers a significant portion of the textbook, including topics such as the natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, real numbers, complex numbers, sequences, series, limits, continuity, differentiation, and integration. It also includes a substantial number of exercises from the book that have been formalized and solved within Lean. This allows students to not only read the formal definitions and proofs but also to engage actively with the material by attempting the exercises in a formal setting.
</p>
<p>
Tao acknowledges that the formalization project is still ongoing and that there may be errors or areas for improvement in the Lean code. He encourages users to provide feedback, report bugs, and contribute to the project by submitting pull requests on GitHub. He also mentions that he plans to use the Lean companion in his own teaching of real analysis, both as a reference for instructors and as a tool for students to explore the material in a more interactive and rigorous manner.

The post also highlights the challenges involved in formalizing mathematics, such as the need to be extremely precise in definitions and the initial steep learning curve associated with using a proof assistant like Lean. However, Tao argues that the benefits of formalization, including increased understanding and the elimination of errors, outweigh these challenges. He hopes that the "Analysis_I.lean" companion will serve as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and anyone interested in learning or teaching real analysis in a more rigorous and formal way.
