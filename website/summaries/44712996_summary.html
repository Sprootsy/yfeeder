    Adam Tooze's Chartbook 400, titled "Not Crisis, But Murder," analyzes the political and economic factors contributing to excess deaths in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. It argues that the high number of deaths, exceeding those in many other developed nations, wasn't simply an unavoidable consequence of a novel virus but rather the result of policy choices and systemic failures, which Tooze describes metaphorically as "murder." The newsletter examines various aspects of this claim, starting with a comparative analysis of excess mortality rates across different countries.

    The analysis emphasizes that the US, despite its wealth and advanced healthcare system, performed poorly in terms of protecting its population from the pandemic compared to countries with similar resources. This discrepancy prompts a deeper examination of the underlying causes. One key area of focus is the fragmented and unequal nature of the US healthcare system, with its dependence on employer-sponsored insurance and significant gaps in coverage for vulnerable populations. This created barriers to access to timely and effective medical care, exacerbating the impact of the virus, especially among marginalized communities.

    Beyond healthcare, Tooze points to broader social and economic factors. The article highlights the role of social inequality, pre-existing health conditions linked to poverty and structural racism, and the prevalence of low-wage jobs that forced many to continue working despite the risks of infection. Moreover, political polarization and the spread of misinformation undermined public health efforts, hindering mask-wearing, vaccination campaigns, and other preventative measures. The absence of a strong social safety net further contributed to the vulnerability of many Americans.

    The article also delves into the political choices made during the pandemic, particularly at the federal level. The initial response under the Trump administration is scrutinized for its denialism, downplaying the severity of the virus, and promoting unproven treatments. While the Biden administration implemented more comprehensive measures, it faced significant political opposition and struggled to overcome vaccine hesitancy and the legacy of distrust in public institutions.

    Tooze's analysis challenges the notion that the high death toll was simply a matter of bad luck or an inevitable consequence of a novel virus. Instead, it argues that policy failures, systemic inequalities, and political choices all played a significant role in shaping the outcome. By framing the situation as "murder," the article seeks to draw attention to the preventability of many of these deaths and to prompt a deeper reflection on the values and priorities that shaped the US response to the pandemic.

    Ultimately, Chartbook 400 serves as a critical examination of the factors contributing to excess deaths in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic, linking these deaths to structural problems and policy choices within American society.
