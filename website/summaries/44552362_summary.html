  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>Pannonhalma Archabbey, a UNESCO World Heritage site in Hungary, is facing a serious threat from an infestation of deathwatch beetles. These wood-boring insects are damaging the wooden structures of the nearly 1,000-year-old abbey, including the basilica, library, and other historic buildings. The monks of the Benedictine order, who have resided at the abbey since its founding, are working with experts to combat the infestation and preserve the cultural heritage of the site. The infestation poses a significant challenge due to the age and historical significance of the buildings, requiring careful and specialized treatment methods. The beetle larvae are feeding on the wooden beams and structures, weakening them and potentially causing structural damage over time. The abbey is exploring various methods to eradicate the beetles and protect the wooden elements from further damage, while striving to maintain the integrity of the historical site. The Pannonhalma Archabbey is a significant religious and cultural center in Hungary. It has been a Benedictine monastery since 996. It houses a valuable library with historical documents and a basilica with significant architectural and artistic value.
