<p>The article discusses a Windhawk mod called "Classic Theme Enable" that aims to restore the classic theme (also known as the basic theme) in Windows 10 and Windows 11. It explains that Microsoft removed the classic theme option from the Windows settings, but the underlying theme engine still exists, making it possible to re-enable it through modifications.</p>

<p>The author details the challenges in bringing back the classic theme, primarily focusing on the visual inconsistencies and glitches that arise when forcing modern applications and UI elements to render using the older theme engine. These issues include problems with shadows, rounded corners, and the overall look of modern controls, which are designed for the newer visual styles.</p>

<p>The Windhawk mod works by intercepting and modifying certain system calls related to theme loading and window creation. It essentially tells Windows to use the classic theme for the entire system. However, the author notes that this approach is not without its limitations and trade-offs. While it successfully enables the classic theme, it can introduce visual artifacts in certain applications, particularly those that heavily rely on modern UI frameworks.</p>

<p>The article highlights that the mod provides options to mitigate some of these issues. One such option is to disable the classic theme for specific processes, allowing problematic applications to render with the default Windows theme while the rest of the system uses the classic theme. This provides a degree of control and customization, allowing users to tailor the experience to their specific needs and preferences.</p>

<p>The author also mentions the potential for future improvements and refinements to the mod. They acknowledge that the current implementation is not perfect and that there is room for further optimization to reduce visual glitches and improve compatibility with a wider range of applications. User feedback and contributions are encouraged to help identify and address remaining issues.</p>

<p>In summary, the "Classic Theme Enable" Windhawk mod offers a way to revive the classic theme in modern versions of Windows. While it may not be a seamless or perfect solution due to inherent incompatibilities between the old theme engine and modern UI elements, it provides a viable option for users who prefer the look and feel of the classic theme and are willing to accept some visual compromises.</p>
