 <h3>Summary</h3>
 <p>
  The Pew Research Center article "How States and Cities Decimated Americansâ€™ Lowest-Cost Housing Option" discusses the decline of single-room occupancy (SRO) housing in the United States. SROs, which are private rooms, typically without private bathrooms or kitchens, and are often rented by the week or month, have historically provided an essential source of affordable housing for low-income individuals. The article explains that a combination of factors, including urban renewal projects, zoning regulations, and a shift in societal attitudes, have contributed to the drastic reduction in the number of SRO units available across the country.
 </p>
 <p>
  Urban renewal initiatives during the mid-20th century often targeted neighborhoods with high concentrations of SROs, leading to their demolition to make way for new developments. Zoning laws that favor single-family homes and restrict multi-unit dwellings have further limited the construction of new SROs and the preservation of existing ones. Additionally, changing perceptions of SROs as undesirable housing options have resulted in a lack of public support for their maintenance and development.

 <p>
  The consequences of this decline are significant. As SROs disappear, low-income individuals face increasing challenges in finding affordable housing, contributing to homelessness and housing instability. The article highlights the need for policymakers to reconsider the role of SROs in addressing the affordable housing crisis and to explore strategies for preserving and expanding this type of housing. This could include revising zoning regulations, offering incentives for SRO development, and addressing negative perceptions through education and community engagement. The article emphasizes that a multi-faceted approach is necessary to ensure that safe and affordable housing options are available to all members of society.
