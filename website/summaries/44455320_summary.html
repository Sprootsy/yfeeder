     The article "Locality of Behaviour" by Carson Gross discusses the importance of maintaining the locality of behaviour in web development. Locality of behaviour, in this context, refers to keeping the logic for a particular user interaction or feature closely tied to the HTML element that triggers it. The article argues that traditional web development approaches, particularly those heavily reliant on JavaScript frameworks, often lead to a separation of concerns that scatters behaviour across multiple files and layers of abstraction, making code harder to understand, maintain, and debug.

     The author criticizes the trend of separating HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript behaviour into distinct files and directories, a practice commonly promoted by modern web development methodologies. While the separation of concerns is a valuable principle, the article suggests that it has been misapplied in web development, resulting in a loss of locality. When behaviour is spread across multiple files, developers must jump between files to understand how a particular feature works, increasing cognitive load and the likelihood of introducing bugs.

     The article proposes an alternative approach that emphasizes keeping behaviour close to the HTML element that triggers it. This can be achieved by using techniques like declarative attributes that allow developers to specify behaviour directly within the HTML markup. The author introduces htmx as a library that facilitates this approach. Htmx allows developers to trigger HTTP requests and update parts of the page directly from HTML attributes, reducing the need for complex JavaScript code.

     The benefits of locality of behaviour include improved code readability, maintainability, and debuggability. When behaviour is located near the HTML element that triggers it, developers can quickly understand how a feature works without having to navigate through multiple files. This also makes it easier to modify and extend the feature in the future.
   </p>

     The author acknowledges that there are trade-offs to consider. For example, keeping all behaviour within HTML can lead to larger HTML files. However, the article argues that the benefits of locality outweigh these drawbacks, especially for projects where maintainability and understandability are paramount.
   </p>
   <p>
     The article concludes by advocating for a more balanced approach to web development that prioritizes locality of behaviour. By keeping behaviour close to the HTML elements that trigger it, developers can create more maintainable, understandable, and debuggable web applications. Htmx is presented as a tool that can help developers achieve this goal.
