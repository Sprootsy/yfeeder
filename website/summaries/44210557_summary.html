<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Proton VPN has reported that the French government demanded they log user IP addresses to identify users accessing Pornhub after France blocked the website. Proton VPN refused this demand. The French government's demand came after France ordered internet service providers to block access to Pornhub after the platform allegedly failed to comply with French laws regarding age verification. Pornhub implemented age verification measures, which the French government said were insufficient. The demand for IP address logging was characterized by Proton VPN as disproportionate and a violation of privacy. Proton VPN stated that they do not log user IP addresses and could not comply with the request even if they wanted to.</p>
