   The article begins by explaining what alt text is and why it matters. It clarifies that alt text is a brief, descriptive text that replaces an image when the image cannot be displayed or is being accessed by a screen reader. This text allows visually impaired users to understand the content and context of the image, ensuring they have a similar experience to sighted users. The author stresses that omitting alt text creates a barrier to access and excludes a significant portion of the online community.

   The author also touches on the potential benefits of alt text for users who do not have visual impairments.
