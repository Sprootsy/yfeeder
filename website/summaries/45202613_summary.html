  <p>This article, published in Nature, reports the creation of a quantum processor with 144 qubits based on electron spins in silicon. The researchers demonstrate the ability to initialize, control, and measure these qubits with high fidelity and connectivity. The processor, fabricated using industrial manufacturing techniques, overcomes previous limitations in scaling up quantum computers while maintaining performance. The study showcases the potential of silicon-based quantum computing as a viable path toward building large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p>
