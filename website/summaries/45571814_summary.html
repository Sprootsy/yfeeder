    <h2>Programming in Assembly Is Brutal, Beautiful, and Maybe Even a Path to Better AI</h2>

<p>This Wired article explores the idea of using assembly language as a potential path toward achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). It argues that while current AI models excel at specific tasks, they lack the general-purpose problem-solving abilities of humans. The author posits that the limitations of current AI stem from the high-level programming languages used to create them, which abstract away the fundamental operations of the computer.</p>

<p>The article draws an analogy between the development of computers and the development of AI. Early computers were programmed directly in assembly language, giving programmers fine-grained control over the hardware. As computers became more complex, high-level languages were developed to make programming easier and more efficient. However, this abstraction came at the cost of direct control over the machine.</p>

<p>The author suggests that AI may be facing a similar situation. Current AI models are built using high-level languages and frameworks, which may be limiting their ability to learn and reason in a general way. By programming AI directly in assembly language, it may be possible to create more flexible and adaptable AI systems.</p>

<p>The article acknowledges that programming AI in assembly language would be a monumental task, requiring a deep understanding of both computer architecture and AI algorithms. However, the author argues that the potential benefits of this approach are significant. An AI programmed in assembly language could potentially learn and reason in a more human-like way, leading to the development of AGI.</p>

<p>The article also explores the challenges of current AI, particularly its reliance on vast amounts of data for training and its lack of common sense reasoning. It suggests that assembly programming might offer a way to overcome these limitations by allowing AI to be built from the ground up with a focus on fundamental principles.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the article presents assembly language as a radical but potentially promising approach to AI development. It challenges the conventional wisdom that high-level languages are the only way to build AI and suggests that going back to the basics might be necessary to achieve true artificial general intelligence.</p>
