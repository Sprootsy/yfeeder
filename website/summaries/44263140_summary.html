   California Gov. Gavin Newsom and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem engaged in a public dispute over immigration policy and border security. The disagreement began when Noem sent about 50 South Dakota National Guard troops to the Texas border to support Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's efforts to deter illegal crossings. Newsom criticized Noem's move as a political stunt and questioned the cost of the deployment to South Dakota taxpayers, while Noem defended her decision as a necessary step to address what she sees as a failure of the Biden administration to secure the border.

   Newsom challenged Noem to a debate on immigration, which Noem accepted, proposing they debate after she visits the U.S.-Mexico border in late February. Noem has been a vocal critic of the Biden administration's immigration policies, blaming them for an increase in illegal immigration and drug trafficking. Newsom, on the other hand, has defended California's more welcoming approach to immigrants, including providing state-funded healthcare to undocumented immigrants.
