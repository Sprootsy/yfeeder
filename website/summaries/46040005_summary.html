<p>The article discusses the strange legal status of Doge, the famous Shiba Inu meme, after the passing of Kabosu, the dog who inspired it. Despite Kabosu's death, Doge persists as a cultural icon and a valuable piece of intellectual property, leading to complex questions about its ownership and future.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The article begins by acknowledging the passing of Kabosu, the Shiba Inu dog whose image became the face of the Doge meme, a significant event that prompted reflection on Doge's cultural impact. However, the central focus shifts to the enduring legal and intellectual property issues surrounding Doge. Despite Kabosu's death, Doge, as an image and a brand, continues to exist and generate value.</p>

<p>The article then presents a legal expert's view on the situation, highlighting the complexities of meme ownership. The expert emphasizes that while Kabosu, the living dog, is no longer with us, the image and the associated trademarks remain. This raises questions about who controls the Doge image and how it can be used in the future.</p>

<p>The article considers the possibility of unauthorized use of the Doge image and the challenges in enforcing copyright or trademark protections. Given the meme's widespread distribution and decentralized nature, policing its use becomes incredibly difficult. The legal expert notes that while the original photographer or owner of Kabosu may have certain rights, the line becomes blurred when the image is transformed and shared across the internet.</p>

<p>The article also touches on the commercial implications of Doge. Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency based on the meme, still has a significant market capitalization, demonstrating the meme's lasting financial impact. This further complicates the legal landscape, as various parties may have a vested interest in protecting or exploiting the Doge image for financial gain.</p>

<p>The article concludes by suggesting that the legal status of Doge will likely remain ambiguous for the foreseeable future. While Kabosu's passing marks the end of an era, the legacy of Doge as a meme and a brand continues to pose intriguing questions about intellectual property in the digital age. The expert suggests that it is not dead, but the future of the meme and the application of legal procedures in relation to the Doge intellectual property are uncertain.</p>
