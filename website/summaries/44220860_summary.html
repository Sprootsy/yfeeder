The author, who runs a platform described as promoting free speech, recounts a history of scrutiny and investigations, asserting they stem from his controversial content and viewpoints. The piece alleges that the FBI has been monitoring him and his activities for an extended period, citing various incidents of surveillance and contact, including agents visiting his residence and questioning his associates. He claims that the FBI's interest intensified following specific publications on his website that challenged government narratives. He expresses strong criticism of the FBI's actions, viewing them as attempts to suppress his freedom of speech and intimidate him into silence. The author maintains he is not engaged in any illegal activities, and he attributes the FBI's scrutiny to his outspoken criticism of the government.

The article also touches on themes of government surveillance, censorship, and the importance of protecting free speech, even when the views expressed are unpopular or controversial. The author frames his situation as a David-versus-Goliath battle, where he, as an individual advocating for free speech, is pitted against the vast resources and power of the federal government.
