    <div>
<div>
<p>Skyroof is a new software package designed for amateur radio satellite tracking and SDR reception. It integrates satellite tracking, rotor control, and SDR receiver functions into a single application, aiming to simplify the process of communicating with satellites for amateur radio operators.</p>

<p>The software is written in Python and leverages libraries like PyEphem for satellite tracking, pyHamlib for rotor control, and supports various SDR devices through gr-osmosdr. It offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use, displaying satellite positions, Doppler shift calculations, and providing controls for adjusting frequency and antenna direction. The software also includes features for audio recording and playback.</p>

<p>Skyroof is available for free download and is open source, encouraging community contributions and further development. The software is compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.</p>
