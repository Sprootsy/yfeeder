    The article "Traffic Fatalities Are a Choice" argues that traffic fatalities are not inevitable "accidents" but rather the result of policy choices and design decisions that prioritize speed and convenience over safety. The author contends that framing these events as accidents obscures the responsibility of policymakers, engineers, and other stakeholders in creating and perpetuating dangerous road conditions. The article emphasizes that a significant portion of traffic fatalities are preventable through evidence-based strategies and a shift in priorities.

    The author points out that the United States has a significantly higher traffic fatality rate compared to other developed countries, attributing this disparity to differences in infrastructure design, speed limits, and a cultural acceptance of risky driving behaviors. The article criticizes the focus on individual driver error as the primary cause of crashes, arguing that this approach neglects the systemic factors that contribute to unsafe road environments. These factors include wide lanes that encourage speeding, inadequate pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, and insufficient traffic calming measures in residential areas.

    The article highlights the importance of adopting a "Vision Zero" approach, which aims to eliminate all traffic fatalities and severe injuries. This approach recognizes that humans make mistakes and that the transportation system should be designed to minimize the consequences of those errors. Key strategies for achieving Vision Zero include lowering speed limits, improving road design to prioritize safety, enhancing pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, and implementing automated enforcement systems.

    The author also discusses the role of vehicle design in reducing traffic fatalities. While advancements in vehicle safety technology, such as airbags and electronic stability control, have contributed to a decline in fatalities, the increasing size and weight of vehicles, particularly SUVs and trucks, pose a greater risk to pedestrians, cyclists, and occupants of smaller vehicles. The article suggests that policies should encourage the production and use of smaller, lighter, and safer vehicles.

    Furthermore, the article emphasizes the importance of data-driven decision-making in traffic safety. By analyzing crash data and identifying high-risk locations and behaviors, policymakers can develop targeted interventions to address specific safety problems. The article also calls for greater transparency and accountability in the transportation planning process, ensuring that safety considerations are prioritized over other factors, such as cost and convenience.

    In conclusion, the article argues that traffic fatalities are a policy choice, and that a significant reduction in these fatalities is possible through a combination of evidence-based strategies, a shift in priorities, and a commitment to creating safer road environments for all users. By recognizing the systemic factors that contribute to traffic crashes and adopting a Vision Zero approach, the author believes that societies can move towards a future where traffic fatalities are rare and unacceptable events.
