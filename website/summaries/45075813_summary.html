    <strong>Summary:</strong>
    New research from the La Follette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison indicates that gains in longevity are slowing, and the probability of living to 100 years old is unlikely for most people. The study, led by Associate Professor Pilar Gonalons-Pons and researcher Jochem de Bresser, challenges the narrative that continuous increases in life expectancy will result in a significant rise in centenarians. Analyzing mortality data from 14 high-income countries, the researchers found that while mortality rates have generally improved, the pace of improvement has decelerated, particularly after the 1950s. They used the mortality data to project the life expectancy of people born between 1920 and 1960, finding that the probability of reaching 100 years old remains low and has not increased as dramatically as previously thought. The research highlights variations across different educational groups, observing a divergence in mortality trends between high and low educated individuals. Those with higher education continue to experience mortality improvements, while those with lower education levels are experiencing slower progress. This research underscores the importance of examining mortality trends with consideration of heterogeneity within populations. The study suggests that the focus should shift from anticipating widespread extreme longevity to addressing inequalities in health and mortality across different socioeconomic groups.
