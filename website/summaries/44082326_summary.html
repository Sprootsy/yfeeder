<p>The article reports on the widespread deployment of live facial recognition (LFR) technology by police forces across England and Wales. By May 2025, a majority of forces are actively using or planning to use LFR, marking a significant expansion in its adoption since its first use in 2020. The technology involves cameras scanning crowds and matching faces against watchlists of individuals of interest, including suspects, missing persons, and even those wanted for low-level offenses.</p>

<p>Civil liberties groups and privacy campaigners express serious concerns about the potential for mass surveillance, inaccuracies, and biases in the technology, and its disproportionate impact on marginalized communities. They argue that the lack of clear regulations and oversight creates a risk of misuse and infringements on fundamental rights. The article highlights instances of misidentification and questions the effectiveness of LFR in reducing crime, citing data that shows a high rate of false positives and a relatively low number of successful identifications.</p>

<p>Police defend the use of LFR as a valuable tool for identifying and apprehending criminals, preventing crime, and protecting the public. They emphasize that the technology is used responsibly and in accordance with the law, with safeguards in place to minimize errors and protect privacy. They argue that LFR can help to locate vulnerable individuals, such as missing children, and to prevent serious offenses.</p>

<p>The article discusses the legal framework governing the use of LFR, including the need for a clear legal basis, necessity, and proportionality. However, critics argue that the current legal framework is inadequate to address the risks posed by the technology and calls for stronger regulation and independent oversight.</p>

<p>The rollout of LFR raises broader questions about the balance between security and privacy in public spaces, and the role of technology in policing. As the technology becomes more sophisticated and widespread, the debate over its use is likely to intensify.</p>
