  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article discusses Kitten-TTS, a new AI voice model that is remarkably small (25MB) and efficient, enabling it to run on low-powered devices like Raspberry Pi. It challenges the trend of increasingly large AI models, arguing that efficiency and accessibility are equally important. Kitten-TTS is positioned as a potential game-changer due to its ability to bring high-quality text-to-speech capabilities to resource-constrained environments and devices. The model's small size makes it easier to deploy, distribute, and integrate into various applications, opening up new possibilities for voice-based interfaces and assistive technologies. The article emphasizes that Kitten-TTS is not necessarily intended to outperform state-of-the-art models in terms of raw audio quality, but rather to provide a practical and accessible solution for a wide range of users and use cases. This shift toward smaller, more efficient models could democratize access to AI technology.
