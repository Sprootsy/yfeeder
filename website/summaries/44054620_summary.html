    The Minor Planet Electronic Circular (MPEC) K25K47, issued by the Minor Planet Center on May 24, 2025, details the discovery and astrometric observations of a new comet, C/2025 K3 (Sheppard). The circular provides precise measurements of the comet's position in the sky at various times, which are crucial for determining its orbit and predicting its future path.

    The observations were made by multiple observatories. The measurements include the date and time of the observation (in Universal Time), the comet's right ascension and declination (celestial coordinates), the magnitude of the comet (brightness), and the observatory code indicating the location where the observation was made. These astrometric data points are essential for astronomers to calculate the comet's orbital elements, such as its semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, and period.

    The MPEC serves as an official announcement to the astronomical community about the discovery of the comet and provides the necessary data for other astronomers to observe and study it. By publishing these observations, the Minor Planet Center facilitates further research on the comet's composition, behavior, and origin. The data allows astronomers to refine the comet's orbit and make more accurate predictions about its future visibility and potential interactions with other objects in the solar system.
