<p>Summary:
The article is a satirical piece from The New York Times, dated May 29, 2025, humorously addressing the evolving expectations around citing sources, particularly in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly personalized digital environments. The piece takes the form of a mock news report about the "Maha Report," a fictional study examining citation practices.
The article describes how, by 2025, the concept of citation has expanded far beyond traditional academic or journalistic norms. People are now expected to cite a vast array of influences, including the AI algorithms that curate their news feeds, the influencers who shape their purchasing decisions, and even the sources of inspiration for their personal thoughts and feelings. This hyper-citation is driven by a societal push for radical transparency and accountability, aiming to acknowledge the complex web of influences that shape individual perspectives and actions.
The Maha Report supposedly highlights the challenges and absurdities of this new citation landscape. People struggle to keep track of all the sources that contribute to their daily lives, leading to "citation fatigue" and the development of AI-powered "citation assistants" designed to automatically track and attribute influences. The report also explores the ethical implications of citing AI, questioning whether algorithms should be credited for their role in shaping information consumption and decision-making.
The article uses humor to critique the potential for citation to become performative and overwhelming. It suggests that the pursuit of radical transparency could lead to a culture of constant self-monitoring and a blurring of the lines between genuine acknowledgment and superficial virtue signaling. The satirical tone underscores the challenges of navigating an increasingly complex information environment, where the sources of influence are often hidden or difficult to identify. Ultimately, the article prompts reflection on the true purpose of citation and the potential consequences of its overextension.
