  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

  <p>The article "I Don't Have Spotify" is a personal essay by S.J. Donado detailing their conscious decision to forgo using Spotify, despite its widespread popularity and convenience. The author explores their reasons, which are multifaceted and range from ethical considerations to personal preferences regarding music consumption. A significant portion of the essay focuses on the author's discomfort with Spotify's business model, particularly its compensation structure for artists. Donado argues that Spotify disproportionately benefits major labels and top-tier artists while providing meager royalties to independent musicians and smaller artists. This, in their view, contributes to the devaluation of music and makes it increasingly difficult for artists to sustain themselves financially.</p>

  <p>The author also discusses the impact of streaming services on the listening experience. They express a preference for actively curating their own music collection through purchasing albums and individual tracks. This allows for a more intentional and focused listening experience, fostering a deeper connection with the music and the artists. Donado contrasts this with the often passive and algorithm-driven nature of Spotify, where listeners are constantly bombarded with suggestions and playlists, potentially leading to a superficial engagement with the music.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the essay touches upon the broader cultural implications of Spotify's dominance in the music industry. The author suggests that the platform's emphasis on algorithmic recommendations and personalized playlists can create echo chambers, limiting exposure to diverse genres and artists. This can hinder musical discovery and potentially stifle creativity and innovation within the music scene. Donado also reflects on the importance of supporting artists directly through purchasing their music or attending their live performances, as this provides a more sustainable and equitable means of revenue for musicians.</p>

  <p>The author acknowledges that their decision to abstain from Spotify may seem unconventional or even inconvenient to some. However, they view it as a conscious choice aligned with their values and a commitment to supporting artists in a more meaningful way. The essay is not a blanket condemnation of Spotify or streaming services in general but rather a personal reflection on the ethical and artistic considerations surrounding music consumption in the digital age. It serves as a call to action for listeners to be more mindful of how their choices impact the music industry and to consider alternative ways of engaging with and supporting the artists they appreciate.</p>

  <p>In essence, the author advocates for a more active, intentional, and ethical approach to music consumption, one that prioritizes direct support for artists and fosters a deeper appreciation for the art form.</p>
