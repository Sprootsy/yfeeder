  <p>The article is a humorous and practical guide for anyone considering stealing the author's 1974 Porsche 914. It's written in a tongue-in-cheek style, acknowledging the car's appeal while simultaneously highlighting its quirks, problems, and the likelihood of the thief being caught or regretting the theft.</p>
 

  <p>The author begins by sarcastically welcoming the prospective thief and outlining the reasons why they might be drawn to the 914, such as its mid-engine design, classic Porsche styling, and potential for open-top driving. However, the author quickly transitions into a detailed list of the car's many flaws and potential issues.</p>
 

  <p>Firstly, the thief should know that the car isn't particularly fast. Its original 1.8-liter engine, even in its prime, offered modest performance. Any attempts at a quick getaway will likely be disappointing. The author also mentions the car's susceptibility to rust, particularly in the "hell hole" area beneath the battery tray and the floor pans. The thief can anticipate spending time and money on rust repair.</p>
 

  <p>The car's electrical system is described as temperamental. The wiring is old and prone to issues, so the thief should be prepared for potential electrical gremlins that could leave them stranded. The original fuel injection system can also be problematic and difficult to diagnose or repair. The author warns of the unique challenges posed by the 914's systems.</p>
 

  <p>The Targa top, a defining feature of the 914, is mentioned, but not without a warning. The author points out that these tops are prone to leaks and difficult to seal properly. The thief should expect to get wet in the rain.</p>
 

  <p>Furthermore, the author emphasizes the strong and passionate community of Porsche 914 enthusiasts. Stealing a 914 is likely to attract attention, and the tight-knit community will be on the lookout for the stolen vehicle. The thief will probably not get away with it for long.</p>
 

  <p>The author also advises the thief to consider the car's quirks. For example, the shifter linkage is notoriously vague, making it difficult to find the right gear. The heating system is often ineffective, leading to cold and uncomfortable drives in cooler weather. The seats may be worn and uncomfortable, particularly on longer journeys.</p>
 

  <p>The article also suggests that the thief should be prepared for constant questions and attention from other 914 enthusiasts. The author jokes that owning a 914 means becoming a de facto ambassador for the model, constantly answering questions about its history, quirks, and reliability.</p>
 

  <p>Finally, the author implies that the thief would be better off buying their own 914, rather than stealing one. They suggest that the thief would then be able to enjoy the car's unique qualities without the guilt of theft and the risk of being caught. The author concludes with a humorous tone, suggesting that the thief should reconsider their plan and perhaps join the 914 community instead.</p>
