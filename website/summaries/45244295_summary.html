  <h2>Summary of Gentoo Council AI Policy</h2>
  <p>The Gentoo Council AI Policy outlines the guidelines and principles for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the Gentoo project. The policy addresses various aspects, including the use of AI tools by Gentoo developers and contributors, the incorporation of AI-generated content into Gentoo, and the potential impact of AI on the Gentoo community.</p>
  <p>The document emphasizes the importance of transparency and disclosure when using AI tools. It states that individuals must clearly indicate when AI has been used to create or modify content, allowing others to assess the contributions appropriately. This transparency aims to maintain trust and accountability within the project.</p>
  <p>The policy also addresses the quality and reliability of AI-generated content. It cautions against relying solely on AI-generated content without proper review and validation. Human oversight remains crucial to ensure accuracy, consistency, and adherence to Gentoo's standards. The policy encourages the use of AI as a tool to augment human capabilities, rather than replace them entirely.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the AI Policy considers the legal and ethical implications of using AI. It highlights the need to respect copyright, licensing terms, and intellectual property rights when using AI tools and incorporating AI-generated content. It also encourages awareness of potential biases and fairness issues in AI algorithms, promoting the responsible and ethical use of AI within the project.</p>
  <p>The policy also addresses the impact of AI on the Gentoo community. It encourages discussions and feedback regarding the use of AI within the project to address any concerns and ensure community consensus. The policy is intended to be a living document that can be updated and revised as AI technology evolves.</p>
  <p>In summary, the Gentoo Council AI Policy aims to provide a framework for the responsible, transparent, and ethical use of AI within the Gentoo project. It emphasizes transparency, human oversight, and community engagement to ensure that AI benefits the project while mitigating potential risks and negative impacts.</p>
