<div>
  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The article discusses FICO's plans to incorporate Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) payment data into its credit scoring models. This move aims to provide a more comprehensive view of consumers' creditworthiness, particularly for those with limited or thin credit files. Currently, BNPL payments are generally not reported to credit bureaus unless there are delinquencies. FICO's new approach will allow lenders to consider on-time BNPL payments, potentially boosting credit scores for responsible users and increasing access to credit. However, the inclusion of BNPL data could also negatively impact scores if consumers have a history of missed payments. The article highlights the potential benefits and risks of this change, emphasizing its significance for both consumers and lenders in the evolving credit landscape.</p>
