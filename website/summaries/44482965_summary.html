  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article is about LisaGUI, an open-source, cross-platform GUI framework. LisaGUI uses a declarative UI approach, reminiscent of web development, allowing developers to define user interfaces with a markup language (based on HTML and CSS) and logic using Javascript. It is designed to be modular and efficient, leveraging the native capabilities of each platform it runs on, such as Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android. This approach aims to provide a blend of web development convenience with the performance and native look-and-feel of desktop and mobile applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    LisaGUI emphasizes rapid development cycles and a familiar workflow for web developers. Its architecture consists of a core engine written in Rust for performance and safety, along with platform-specific renderers that translate the declarative UI descriptions into native UI elements. The framework offers features like data binding, allowing UI elements to automatically update based on underlying data changes, and styling through a CSS-like system, providing developers with extensive control over the appearance of their applications.

    The framework aims to support a wide array of use cases, from simple desktop tools to complex mobile applications. The modular design also allows developers to extend the framework with custom components and functionalities, promoting code reuse and maintainability. LisaGUI is designed to work on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.
