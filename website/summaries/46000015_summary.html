    <h2>Nursing excluded as &#39;professional&#39; degree by Department of Education</h2>

  <p><b>Summary:</b></p>
  <p>The article discusses the U.S. Department of Education's (ED) proposed changes to the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes, which are used to categorize fields of study and are important for federal funding and data collection. The proposed changes exclude entry-level Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) programs from being classified as "professional degrees," a move that has sparked significant concern and opposition from nursing organizations and professionals. These groups argue that the reclassification would undervalue the complex, specialized knowledge and skills required of nurses, potentially impacting federal support for nursing education and research, and hindering the profession's ability to address critical healthcare needs. The article highlights the potential consequences of this decision, including reduced access to financial aid for nursing students, decreased funding for nursing programs, and a diminished perception of nursing as a highly skilled and essential healthcare profession. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) and other nursing advocacy groups are actively working to challenge the proposed reclassification and ensure that nursing education receives the recognition and support it deserves.</p>
