    <h2>The Internet runs on free and open source software and so does the DNS</h2>

  <p>The article emphasizes the critical role of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in the functioning of the Internet, particularly within the Domain Name System (DNS). It highlights that much of the Internet's infrastructure relies on FOSS, which promotes collaboration, transparency, and innovation. FOSS allows anyone to inspect, modify, and distribute the software, leading to community-driven improvements and enhanced security through widespread peer review. The DNS, which translates domain names into IP addresses, heavily depends on FOSS implementations like BIND, Knot DNS, and PowerDNS. These FOSS DNS servers are widely used by authoritative name servers and recursive resolvers, forming the backbone of Internet addressability. The open nature of FOSS DNS software enables rapid adaptation to new threats and evolving standards. Furthermore, the article points out that FOSS fosters competition and prevents vendor lock-in, as organizations can choose from various implementations and contribute to their development. The collaborative aspect of FOSS also facilitates knowledge sharing and training within the Internet community. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) actively supports FOSS initiatives through funding, infrastructure, and community engagement. This support ensures the continued development and maintenance of essential FOSS components for the Internet ecosystem. The article concludes by reinforcing the idea that the Internet's resilience, security, and innovation are intrinsically linked to the principles and practices of Free and Open Source Software.</p>
