   The article "Why the Internet Is Turning to Shit" by Nathan J. Robinson, published in
   <em>Current Affairs</em>, explores the perceived decline in the quality and usefulness of the
   internet. Robinson argues that the internet, once envisioned as a democratizing force for
   knowledge and connection, is increasingly becoming a frustrating, commercialized, and
   manipulative environment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Robinson posits that several factors contribute to this degradation. The dominance of a few
   large tech companies, such as Google, Facebook (Meta), and Amazon, has led to centralization
   and a lack of genuine competition. These companies prioritize profit maximization over user
   experience, resulting in algorithm-driven content that often favors sensationalism, outrage,
   and misinformation. The pursuit of engagement leads to the amplification of extreme viewpoints
   and the creation of echo chambers, further polarizing society.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article criticizes the advertising-based business model that fuels much of the internet.
   The need to attract and retain users for advertising purposes incentivizes platforms to
   manipulate user behavior and collect vast amounts of personal data. This data is then used to
   target users with increasingly personalized ads, often exploiting their vulnerabilities and
   contributing to a sense of constant surveillance.
  </p>
  <p>
   Robinson also points to the decline in the quality of online content. The rise of clickbait,
   sponsored content, and search engine optimization (SEO) has made it increasingly difficult to
   find reliable and trustworthy information. The internet is now flooded with low-quality articles,
   duplicate content, and deceptive websites designed to generate revenue or promote specific
   agendas.
  </p>
  <p>
   The author laments the loss of the internet's early promise of decentralization and community.
   The consolidation of power in the hands of a few tech giants has stifled innovation and
   reduced user autonomy. The rise of social media has also contributed to a culture of online
   bullying, harassment, and political polarization.
  </p>
  <p>
   While acknowledging the continued existence of valuable resources and communities online,
   Robinson expresses concern about the overall trajectory of the internet. He suggests that a
   fundamental shift in values and priorities is needed to reclaim the internet's potential as a
   force for good. This shift would involve prioritizing user well-being over profit, promoting
   decentralization and competition, and fostering a culture of critical thinking and media
   literacy.
