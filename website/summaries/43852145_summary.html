        <h1>Apple violated antitrust ruling, judge finds</h1>
        <p>

<p>A federal judge has found that Apple violated an injunction related to an antitrust ruling in its case with Epic Games. The injunction was intended to prevent Apple from stopping developers from communicating with users about alternative payment options. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers determined that Apple's restrictions on developers providing pricing information within apps and through contact information obtained within the app violated the court's order. The original antitrust lawsuit, brought by Epic Games, centered on Apple's App Store policies, which require developers to use Apple's in-app purchase system and pay a commission, typically 30%, on digital sales. Epic Games argued that these policies were anticompetitive and harmed consumers. While the court initially ruled mostly in favor of Apple, it did issue an injunction to prevent Apple from anti-steering, thus enabling developers to inform users of alternative payment methods. The recent ruling clarifies that Apple's implementation of the injunction did not fully comply with the court's intent, as Apple continued to restrict developers from directly informing users about alternative payment options within the app itself. The court rejected Apple's arguments that its policies were necessary to protect users or prevent fraud. The implication of the ruling is that Apple will need to modify its App Store policies further to comply with the injunction and allow developers to more freely communicate with users about payment methods outside of Apple's ecosystem.</p>
