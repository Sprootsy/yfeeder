    The article "It's 2025, Why Are Banks Still Getting Authentication So Wrong?" by Jamal Habash discusses the persistent failures in authentication methods used by banks, even with the advancement of technology. The author argues that despite innovations like biometrics and advanced fraud detection systems, banks continue to rely on outdated and insecure authentication practices, leading to customer frustration and increased vulnerability to fraud.
  </p>
  <p>
    Habash points out that many banks still depend on knowledge-based authentication (KBA), which involves asking customers security questions that are often easily guessable or obtainable through public information. This method is flawed because the answers to these questions are not truly secret and can be compromised through social engineering or data breaches. The author emphasizes that relying on KBA puts customers at risk of identity theft and account takeover.

    The article criticizes the over-reliance on SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA), which, while better than KBA, is still susceptible to SIM swapping attacks and interception. Habash notes that more secure alternatives, such as authenticator apps and hardware security keys, are available but not widely adopted by banks. The lack of adoption is attributed to banks prioritizing cost savings and user convenience over robust security measures.

    Furthermore, the author highlights the disconnect between the sophisticated fraud detection systems banks employ and the weak authentication methods they use. Banks invest heavily in analyzing transaction patterns to identify fraudulent activity but fail to adequately secure the initial login process, making it easier for fraudsters to gain access in the first place. This creates a situation where banks are reactive rather than proactive in preventing fraud.

    Habash suggests that banks need to prioritize user security by implementing stronger authentication methods and educating customers about the risks associated with weak passwords and KBA. He advocates for the adoption of passwordless authentication, biometric verification, and more secure 2FA options. Additionally, the author stresses the importance of banks continuously evaluating and updating their security protocols to stay ahead of evolving threats. The article concludes by emphasizing that banks have a responsibility to protect their customers' financial information and that improving authentication is a critical step in fulfilling that responsibility. The author emphasizes the need for a paradigm shift in how banks approach authentication, moving from outdated and vulnerable methods to more robust and user-friendly solutions.
