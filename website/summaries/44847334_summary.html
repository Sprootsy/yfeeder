  <h2>Summary</h2>
 

  <p>
  The article "Serverless Computing: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back" by Tyler Treat critiques the current state of serverless computing, arguing that while it offers benefits like reduced operational overhead and scalability, it also introduces significant drawbacks that can negate those advantages. The author contends that the industry has overhyped serverless, often overlooking the complexities and limitations that arise in real-world applications.
  </p>
 

  <p>
  Treat begins by acknowledging the appeal of serverless, particularly its promise of abstracting away infrastructure management. Developers can focus on writing code without worrying about provisioning servers, patching operating systems, or scaling resources. The pay-per-execution model also seems attractive, as users only pay for the actual compute time consumed by their functions.
  </p>
 

  <p>
  However, the article quickly pivots to the downsides. One major concern is vendor lock-in. Serverless platforms are proprietary, and migrating applications between providers can be difficult and costly. This lack of portability limits flexibility and reduces negotiating power.
  </p>
 

  <p>
  Another critical issue is the complexity of debugging and monitoring. Serverless applications are often composed of many small, independent functions, making it challenging to trace requests and diagnose problems. Traditional debugging tools are often ineffective in serverless environments, requiring developers to rely on logging and distributed tracing, which can be cumbersome to set up and maintain.
  </p>
 

  <p>
  The article also highlights the problem of cold starts. When a serverless function is invoked after a period of inactivity, the platform needs to allocate resources and initialize the function, resulting in a delay known as a cold start. These delays can significantly impact application performance, especially for latency-sensitive applications. While various techniques exist to mitigate cold starts (such as keeping functions "warm"), they often add complexity and cost.
  </p>

  Furthermore, Treat argues that serverless architectures can lead to increased complexity in application design. Managing state in a stateless environment requires careful consideration and often involves external data stores, which can introduce latency and increase costs. Orchestrating multiple serverless functions can also be challenging, requiring the use of workflow engines or complex event-driven architectures.
  </p>
 

  <p>
  The author suggests that serverless is not a silver bullet and that its suitability depends on the specific use case. For simple, event-driven applications with infrequent execution, serverless can be a good fit. However, for more complex, stateful applications with demanding performance requirements, the drawbacks of serverless may outweigh the benefits.
  </p>
 

  <p>
  Treat concludes by advocating for a more balanced perspective on serverless computing. He urges developers to carefully evaluate the trade-offs and to consider alternative approaches, such as containers or virtual machines, before adopting serverless. He also calls for greater standardization and open-source tooling in the serverless ecosystem to address issues like vendor lock-in and improve the developer experience. The title "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back" encapsulates the author's view that while serverless represents progress in some areas, it also introduces new challenges that must be carefully considered.
