   The article discusses a hypothetical future, specifically August 14, 2025, where the landscape of technology and its regulation has significantly shifted. The narrative centers around a series of interconnected issues concerning mergers, data privacy, antitrust enforcement, and the evolving role of regulatory bodies like the FTC.
  </p>
  <p>
   The core of the discussion revolves around the fictional merger of Koch Industries and AT&amp;T, seen as a culmination of a long trend of unchecked corporate consolidation. This merger raises significant concerns due to Koch Industries' history of anti-regulatory lobbying and AT&amp;T's control over crucial communication infrastructure. The combined entity poses a threat to net neutrality and could potentially manipulate information flow for political and economic gain. The hypothetical scenario suggests that the regulatory bodies lack sufficient power or political will to prevent such a merger.

   The narrative also touches upon the failure of comprehensive federal privacy legislation. Despite years of debate, a strong federal privacy law remains elusive, primarily due to disagreements over key provisions such as private rights of action. As a result, state-level privacy laws continue to proliferate, creating a complex and often inconsistent regulatory landscape for businesses. This patchwork approach to privacy regulation is seen as ineffective in protecting consumers' data rights.

   Furthermore, the article explores the challenges faced by antitrust enforcers in the face of powerful tech companies. Lina Khan's efforts at the FTC to challenge anticompetitive practices are acknowledged, but the article suggests that these efforts are insufficient to reverse the trend of increasing corporate power. The difficulties in unwinding existing mergers and the limitations of current antitrust laws are highlighted as major obstacles.

  <p>
   The article presents a bleak outlook on the future of technology regulation, suggesting that the current trajectory could lead to a concentration of power in the hands of a few large corporations, with negative consequences for consumers, innovation, and democratic values. The author implies the need for more robust regulatory frameworks, stronger enforcement mechanisms, and a greater willingness to challenge corporate power.
  </p>
  <p>
   In essence, the article serves as a warning about the potential consequences of unchecked corporate power and regulatory capture in the digital age. It calls for a more proactive and assertive approach to antitrust enforcement and data privacy regulation to prevent the erosion of consumer rights and democratic institutions.
