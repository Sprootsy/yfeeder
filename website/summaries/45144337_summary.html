<h3>Summary</h3>
The article from Atlas of the Universe describes the contents of the universe within 12 light years of Earth, focusing on the stars and brown dwarfs that reside in our immediate cosmic neighborhood. It starts by explaining the scale, noting that even at this relatively short distance, the immense scale of space means that these objects are extremely faint.
The article details the known stars within this sphere, with the most prominent being Alpha Centauri, a triple star system consisting of Alpha Centauri A, Alpha Centauri B, and the red dwarf Proxima Centauri. Alpha Centauri A and B are Sun-like stars. Proxima Centauri is currently the closest star to the Sun, although its faintness makes it invisible to the naked eye.
Other notable stars mentioned include Barnard's Star, a red dwarf with a high proper motion, and the binary star system of Wolf 359, another red dwarf system. The article also lists other red dwarfs, such as Lalande 21185, and faint brown dwarfs, highlighting the difficulty in detecting such small, dim objects.
The article points out that most stars within 12 light years are red dwarfs, which are much smaller and cooler than our Sun. These stars are so faint that many are not visible without telescopes. The luminosity of these stars is far less than that of the Sun.

The article explains that the search for more objects in our local neighborhood is ongoing. Space is so big and most of the objects so faint that astronomers believe more objects will eventually be found in the Solar System's neighborhood.
