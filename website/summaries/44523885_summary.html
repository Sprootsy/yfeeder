    <h2>Millions of Cars Exposed to Remote Hacking via PerfektBlue Attack</h2>

  <p>According to a report by cybersecurity firm Upstream, millions of vehicles are vulnerable to remote hacking due to a vulnerability in the Bluetooth chips used in their telematics control units (TCUs). This vulnerability, dubbed 'Perfektblue,' affects certain MediaTek chipsets and could allow attackers to gain control over various vehicle functions, including unlocking doors, starting the engine, and disabling safety features. The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) implementation, specifically a lack of proper encryption and authentication, which allows unauthorized access to the TCU. This access could then be leveraged to compromise other vehicle systems connected to the TCU.</p>
  <p>The Perfektblue vulnerability was first discovered in 2023 and affects vehicles from multiple manufacturers. While the exact number of affected vehicles is unknown, Upstream estimates that millions are potentially at risk. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely if the attacker is within Bluetooth range of the vehicle and can bypass existing security measures. Once the attacker gains access, they can send malicious commands to the TCU, potentially compromising critical vehicle functions.</p>
  <p>Upstream has worked with MediaTek and affected vehicle manufacturers to address the Perfektblue vulnerability. Patches and software updates have been released to mitigate the risk. However, the process of updating all affected vehicles can be slow and complex, leaving many vehicles vulnerable for an extended period. It's advised that owners of potentially affected vehicles check with their manufacturer for available updates and take precautions to protect their vehicles from potential attacks.</p>
