<p>The article discusses the ongoing struggle over privatization within Yosemite National Park, highlighting how this reflects a broader trend in US national parks. It traces the history of commercial operations in Yosemite, starting with the early concessions granted to private companies to provide services like lodging and transportation. These concessions, initially intended to enhance visitor experience, have gradually expanded, leading to concerns about the increasing commercialization of the park and its impact on the natural environment and public access. The article points out that while proponents argue privatization improves efficiency and reduces the burden on taxpayers, critics contend that it prioritizes profit over conservation and equitable access. The tension between preservation and commercial interests is a recurring theme, with examples like the Ahwahnee Hotel (now The Majestic Yosemite Hotel) and other facilities demonstrating the complex relationship between private enterprise and park management. The piece also notes the controversies surrounding concession contracts, including legal battles and accusations of monopolies, which underscore the challenges of balancing private sector involvement with the public interest in national parks. The article emphasizes that the situation in Yosemite is indicative of a larger debate about the appropriate role of privatization in managing America's natural and cultural heritage.</p>
