<p>The provided link directs to the Merlin Bird ID app website, hosted by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. The site promotes Merlin as a free app designed to help users identify birds they see or hear. Merlin offers multiple ways to identify birds: Photo ID, Sound ID, and Step-by-Step ID.</p>

<p>The <strong>Photo ID</strong> feature allows users to upload a photo of a bird, and Merlin will use computer vision technology to suggest possible matches. The app asks for the location and date the photo was taken to narrow down the possibilities based on which birds are likely to be present in that area at that time.</p>

<p>The <strong>Sound ID</strong> feature allows users to record bird songs or calls, and Merlin will identify the birds making those sounds in real-time. This is helpful for identifying birds that are heard but not seen. It provides a spectrogram display to visualize the sound and helps to train the user to recognize bird vocalizations.</p>

<p>The <strong>Step-by-Step ID</strong> feature guides users through a series of simple questions about the bird they saw. These questions include location, date, size, main colors, and behavior. Based on these answers, Merlin provides a list of possible bird matches.</p>

<p>Merlin also provides information about each bird species, including photos, sound recordings, maps, and identification tips. The app is available for both iOS and Android devices and supports identifications in multiple regions around the world. The app learns and improves its suggestions over time, based on user feedback and new data.</p>

<p>The website encourages users to download the app and start identifying birds. It highlights the ease of use and the scientific accuracy of the app, emphasizing that it is a valuable tool for both beginner and experienced birdwatchers.</p>
