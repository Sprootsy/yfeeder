<p>The Australian government is considering measures to require age verification for search engines to protect children from harmful online content. This follows the passage of the Online Safety Act, which empowers the eSafety Commissioner to address online harms. The proposed measures aim to prevent children from accessing age-inappropriate material through search results. While the specifics are still under discussion, the government is exploring various technological solutions and consulting with stakeholders, including search engine providers, advocacy groups, and parents. Concerns have been raised about the potential impact on privacy, the effectiveness of age verification technologies, and the risk of unintended consequences, such as limiting access to legitimate information. Different approaches to age verification are being evaluated, including requiring users to create accounts with verified ages, using AI to detect potentially harmful content, and implementing parental controls. The goal is to find a balance between protecting children and preserving access to information while minimizing the burden on users and search engine providers. The government is expected to release further details and consult on specific proposals in the near future.</p>
