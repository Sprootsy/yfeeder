<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>The Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) has opted to purchase eight Gripen E fighter jets from Sweden, foregoing the chance to acquire F-16s from the United States. The deal, worth approximately US$600 million, represents the second phase of the RTAF's Gripen acquisition program. The initial phase saw the purchase of six Gripen C/D aircraft, which currently serve as part of Thailand’s air defense system, particularly patrolling the southern region of the country.</p>

<p>Air Chief Marshal Phanpakdee Pattanakul confirmed the decision and stated that the Gripen E was chosen because it met the RTAF’s requirements and budget. The new aircraft are intended to bolster Thailand's air capabilities and replace aging F-5 fighter jets. Deliveries of the Gripen E are expected around 2026.</p>

<p>While the article doesn't explicitly detail why the F-16s were passed over, it suggests budgetary constraints and the suitability of the Gripen E to Thailand's needs as key factors. The Gripen E is known for its advanced technology, operational flexibility, and relatively lower operating costs compared to some of its competitors.</p>

<p>This purchase underscores Thailand's ongoing efforts to modernize its air force and maintain regional security. It also highlights the competitive nature of the international arms market, where factors beyond just technical specifications, such as cost and political considerations, play a significant role in procurement decisions.</p>
