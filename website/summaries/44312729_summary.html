  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Gilead Sciences' Sunlenca (lenacapavir) injection for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). This marks the first twice-yearly injectable option for HIV prevention, offering an alternative to daily oral pills. Sunlenca is designed for adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg who are at risk of acquiring HIV. The approval is based on data from the Phase 3 PURPOSE 1 study, which demonstrated that Sunlenca was highly effective in preventing HIV infection in cisgender women and adolescent girls. The trial showed a 100% efficacy rate in this population. Gilead plans to conduct further studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Sunlenca in other populations, including cisgender men who have sex with men, transgender individuals, and people who inject drugs. Sunlenca will be available in the U.S. soon, providing a long-acting PrEP option. The approval is significant as it addresses the need for more convenient and discreet HIV prevention methods, which could improve adherence and reduce new HIV infections.</p>
