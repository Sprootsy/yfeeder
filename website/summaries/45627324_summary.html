    Ripgrep 15.0.0 is a new major release that includes several new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes. A notable new feature is the addition of an API to the `grep-printer` crate, which enables the development of tools that can emulate ripgrep's output format.

    A new option, `--no-messages`, has been added to suppress error messages. A new flag, `--json-truncate`, allows to truncate long lines in JSON output.
