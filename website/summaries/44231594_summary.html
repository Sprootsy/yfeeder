  <p>Summary:</p>
  <p>
    The article, published on boston.conman.org on June 9, 2025, details a series of increasingly bizarre and disruptive incidents attributed to a coordinated effort by individuals described as "Zoomers" targeting various historical sites and cultural events in Boston. The incidents appear to be pranks taken to an extreme, pushing the boundaries of performance art and outright vandalism. The author expresses growing concern and annoyance at the escalating nature of these stunts and the apparent lack of effective response from local authorities.

    The initial incident involved a flash mob dressed as historical figures disrupting a Boston Tea Party reenactment, throwing laptops and shouting about "digital liberty." This was followed by a group attempting to replace the swan boats in the Public Garden with inflatable rubber ducks, claiming it was an "upgrade." The stunts then took a darker turn with the defacing of the Cheers sign with graffiti promoting obscure cryptocurrency and the release of hundreds of hamsters into Fenway Park during a Red Sox game.

    The article criticizes the local authorities for their seemingly passive approach, pointing out the limited police presence and the lack of arrests despite the clear violations of public order and vandalism. The author fears that the continued lack of consequences will only embolden the perpetrators and lead to even more outrageous and damaging stunts in the future. The article concludes with a plea for the city to take these incidents seriously and implement effective measures to deter such behavior and protect Boston's cultural heritage.
