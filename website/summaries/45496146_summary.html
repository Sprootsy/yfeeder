<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The article discusses the technical aspects and reasoning behind Riot Games' decision to use 128-tick servers for Valorant. It emphasizes the importance of high tick rates for competitive integrity in a tactical shooter where precision and low latency are crucial. The higher the tick rate, the more frequently the server updates the game state, leading to a more accurate and responsive experience for players.</p>

<p>Riot acknowledges that while higher tick rates generally improve gameplay, there are diminishing returns and increased costs associated with them. They detail the trade-offs between server performance, bandwidth usage, and the client-side resources required to process more frequent updates. The article explains how Riot arrived at 128-tick after evaluating other options like 60-tick and considering the balance between perceived responsiveness and server stability.</p>

<p>A significant portion of the article focuses on the technical challenges of implementing and maintaining 128-tick servers. This includes optimizing server code for performance, ensuring scalability to handle large numbers of concurrent players, and dealing with network variability and packet loss. Riot describes the measures they take to mitigate these challenges, such as using robust networking protocols and implementing techniques to compensate for lag and jitter.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the article delves into the client-side optimizations necessary to take full advantage of the 128-tick server. This involves ensuring that the game client can process and render the frequent updates without introducing stutters or performance bottlenecks. Riot explains how they have optimized the game engine and rendering pipeline to achieve this, including techniques like multithreading and efficient data structures.</p>

<p>The article also addresses the issue of perceived differences between client-side actions and server-side representation. Even with 128-tick servers, there can still be discrepancies due to network latency and other factors. Riot discusses the techniques they use to minimize these discrepancies, such as lag compensation and hit validation, to ensure that the game feels fair and consistent for all players.</p>

<p>Finally, the article touches upon Riot's ongoing commitment to improving Valorant's infrastructure and networking. They mention plans for future enhancements, such as exploring new networking technologies and further optimizing server and client performance. The goal is to continually refine the game's responsiveness and competitive integrity, providing the best possible experience for Valorant players.</p>
