    The article details the author's experience of playing 1,000 hands of online poker to collect data and then building a web application using Cursor AI to analyze and visualize that data. The author, initially a novice poker player, aimed to improve their understanding of the game through data analysis. They chose to play 1,000 hands of No-Limit Hold'em at a low-stakes online poker site, recording data such as hand rankings, pot sizes, and betting actions in a CSV file.

    After collecting the data, the author used Cursor AI, an AI-powered code editor, to build a web application for analyzing and visualizing their poker data. The author walked through the process of using Cursor AI, starting from creating a Next.js application and importing the CSV data. Cursor AI assisted in generating code for data processing, including calculating hand rankings and win/loss amounts. The AI tool was particularly helpful in creating charts and graphs to visualize trends in the data, such as win rate by hand ranking and profit/loss over time.

    The author emphasized the iterative nature of using Cursor AI, where they would prompt the AI with specific tasks, review the generated code, and then refine the prompts based on the results. This process allowed them to progressively build the web application and gain insights from their poker data. The author noted that Cursor AI significantly accelerated the development process, allowing them to build a functional data analysis tool with limited prior experience in web development or data visualization.

    The article highlights the potential of AI tools like Cursor AI to empower individuals to analyze data and build applications, even without extensive programming knowledge. The author found that while Cursor AI could generate code efficiently, it was still important to understand the underlying code and data to ensure accuracy and make informed decisions. The author reflects on the overall experience as a valuable learning opportunity.
