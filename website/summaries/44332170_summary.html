<p>This article is about WikiRadio, a system developed by Monkeon for creating and managing Internet radio stations. WikiRadio aims to make radio broadcasting more accessible, manageable, and community-driven. It combines the accessibility and collaborative features of a wiki with the structure and functionality of radio broadcasting software.</p>

<p>The core concept of WikiRadio revolves around using a wiki-like interface to collaboratively build and manage radio playlists, shows, and overall station content. Users can contribute to the station by adding tracks, creating playlists, scheduling shows, and managing various aspects of the station's operation. This collaborative approach aims to democratize radio broadcasting and allow communities to create content relevant to their interests.</p>

<p>The system's architecture includes several key components. It features a content management system (CMS) for organizing and storing audio tracks, show recordings, and other content. It has scheduling tools for arranging the broadcast schedule, allowing for both automated and live programming. A playout engine handles the actual broadcasting of the audio stream, and user management features control access and permissions for different contributors. The wiki-style interface enables easy editing and contribution by multiple users.</p>

<p>WikiRadio's functionalities include collaborative playlist creation, where multiple users can add and organize tracks into playlists. It supports scheduled broadcasting, allowing users to set specific times for shows or playlists to air. Live broadcasting capabilities enable real-time shows and interactions. User roles and permissions ensure that different users have appropriate levels of access and control. Also, content management features help organize and categorize audio files and other media.</p>

<p>The advantages of WikiRadio include its ease of use, collaborative nature, and cost-effectiveness. The wiki interface is designed to be intuitive, making it easy for users with varying levels of technical expertise to contribute. The collaborative features allow communities to build content together, fostering engagement and ownership. By leveraging open-source technologies and simplified infrastructure, WikiRadio aims to lower the barriers to entry for starting and running an Internet radio station.</p>

<p>WikiRadio can be used in various scenarios, such as community radio stations, educational institutions, and corporate intranets. Community radio stations can use it to involve local residents in creating and managing content. Educational institutions can use it as a learning tool for students studying broadcasting or media production. Corporate intranets can use it to create internal communication channels.</p>

<p>The article emphasizes WikiRadio's potential to empower individuals and communities to create their own radio stations and share their voices with the world. By combining the principles of wikis with the functionality of radio broadcasting, WikiRadio offers a unique and accessible platform for creating community-driven audio content.</p>
