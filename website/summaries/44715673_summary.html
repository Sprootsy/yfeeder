<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
This document summarizes the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy of Zoom as analyzed by Tosdr.org. Zoom's terms are classified as Class D, indicating significant concerns regarding user rights and privacy.
</p>
<p>
A major concern revolves around Zoom's data collection practices. The platform collects a vast amount of user data, including personal information, content of communications, usage data, and technical information about devices. This data collection extends beyond what is strictly necessary for providing the service.
</p>
<p>
Regarding data usage, Zoom states that it uses collected data for various purposes, including service improvement, personalization, marketing, and research. However, the breadth of these purposes and the potential for data sharing raise concerns about how user data is utilized. The company might share some information with third parties.
</p>
<p>
Users' content is processed by Zoom, which means that user communications and shared files are accessible and potentially used by the company.
</p>
<p>
The terms grant Zoom broad rights to use user content. While users retain ownership of their content, Zoom has the right to use, copy, distribute, and create derivative works from it. The user grants Zoom a license to use the content.
</p>
<p>
Zoom's policy states that it implements security measures to protect user data, but it also acknowledges that no security system is impenetrable. Therefore, there is always a risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
</p>
<p>
The document also mentions potential issues related to changes in terms, account termination, and dispute resolution. Zoom reserves the right to modify its terms at any time, and users are responsible for staying informed of any changes. Zoom can terminate accounts for various reasons.
