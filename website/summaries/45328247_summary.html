<p>Annie Mueller, a non-developer, shares her experience of trying to follow a tutorial written by a developer for beginners. She highlights the challenges she faced and offers constructive feedback on how developers can improve their tutorials to be more accessible and effective for non-technical audiences.</p>

<p>Mueller emphasizes that developers often overestimate the existing knowledge of beginners. She points out that terms and concepts that are commonplace for developers might be completely foreign to someone new to coding. She stresses the importance of defining technical terms clearly and providing context for each step in the tutorial. Avoid jargon and if it is necessary, it is important to define them in simple terms. Also, avoid making assumptions about the reader's familiarity with basic development tools or environments.</p>

<p>She explains that beginners need a clear understanding of the "why" behind each action. The tutorial should explain the purpose of each step and how it contributes to the overall goal. Without this context, beginners may struggle to understand the logic of the process and may be unable to troubleshoot problems or adapt the tutorial to their own needs.</p>

<p>The article stresses the importance of providing specific, step-by-step instructions. Developers should avoid vague language or instructions that require the reader to make assumptions. Each step should be clearly defined and easy to follow, even for someone with no prior experience. Clear and concise instructions are key to reducing frustration and preventing beginners from getting stuck.</p>

<p>The author also points out the importance of error handling. Tutorials should anticipate common errors that beginners might encounter and provide guidance on how to resolve them. Error messages can be confusing and intimidating for beginners, so it is essential to explain what the error means and how to fix it. Providing troubleshooting tips and resources can help beginners build confidence and develop problem-solving skills.</p>

<p>Mueller suggests using visuals, such as screenshots or diagrams, to illustrate key concepts and steps. Visual aids can help beginners understand complex ideas more easily and can make the tutorial more engaging and less intimidating. Visuals can also be helpful for demonstrating the expected outcome of each step, allowing beginners to verify that they are on the right track.</p>

<p>She encourages developers to test their tutorials with actual beginners before publishing them. This can help identify areas where the tutorial is unclear or confusing and can provide valuable feedback on how to improve it. Testing with beginners can also help developers gain a better understanding of the challenges that non-technical users face.</p>

<p>Finally, Mueller emphasizes the importance of patience and empathy. She reminds developers that beginners are often nervous and insecure about their lack of knowledge. Tutorials should be written in a friendly and encouraging tone, and developers should be willing to provide support and answer questions.</p>
