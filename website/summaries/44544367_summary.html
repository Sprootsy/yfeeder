    <h2>I Messed Up My Google PM Vibe Coding Interview</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p>The article is a Reddit post from someone who interviewed for a Product Manager (PM) role at Google and felt they performed poorly in the "vibe" or behavioral part of the interview. The poster describes the interview as focusing on past experiences and how they handled different situations. They felt they stumbled through their answers, didn't articulate their thought process clearly, and failed to convey their personality effectively. They specifically mention struggling with questions about working with difficult team members and dealing with ambiguous situations. They are looking for advice and insights from other Redditors on how to improve their performance in future PM interviews, especially the behavioral aspect.</p>
