    According to a blog post on Bluesky Social dated August 22, 2025, Mississippi House Bill 1126 (HB1126) has become law. The post details how this law impacts social media within the state, particularly focusing on content moderation and user verification.
  </p>
  <p>
    The law mandates "Verified Citizen" status for social media users in Mississippi. This status requires users to provide government-issued identification to the social media platform to verify their identity and age. Platforms are required to display a visible badge or indicator signifying Verified Citizen status on user profiles and posts. This verification is intended to reduce anonymity and increase accountability online, particularly in relation to harmful or misleading content.
  </p>
  <p>
    The law places restrictions on content moderation policies of social media companies. It prohibits platforms from removing or downranking content based on viewpoint. Platforms are allowed to remove content that is illegal, incites violence, or directly threatens individuals, but must apply these restrictions consistently and transparently. HB1126 also establishes a process for users to appeal content moderation decisions they believe are biased or unfair. If a platform is found to have violated the law, it can be subject to fines and other penalties.
  </p>
  <p>
    The blog post expresses concern that HB1126 could lead to a number of unintended consequences. The verification requirement may disproportionately affect marginalized communities who lack easy access to government-issued IDs. It could also create privacy risks as platforms collect and store sensitive personal information.
  </p>
  <p>
    The restrictions on content moderation are a point of concern, as they could hinder platforms' ability to remove harmful content, such as hate speech and disinformation. This could lead to a more toxic online environment and erode trust in social media.
  </p>
  <p>
    The blog post highlights the potential challenges of enforcing HB1126 and the risk of legal challenges, citing First Amendment concerns related to free speech and the editorial rights of social media platforms. The post concludes by stating that Bluesky Social is evaluating the law and its potential impact on its users in Mississippi, and that they are committed to finding ways to balance compliance with the law while upholding their values of free expression and user safety.
