    <h2>UK Petition: Do not introduce Digital ID cards</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p>This is a petition on the UK Parliament website calling for a general election to be held no later than the first week of June 2024. The petition argues that the current government lacks a clear mandate from the public, as there has not been a general election since December 2019, and there have been significant changes in leadership since then. It states that the Prime Minister was not chosen by the public, and that the government should seek a fresh mandate to ensure it has the authority to govern.</p>
