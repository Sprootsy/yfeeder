  <p>Philips has announced a new digital pathology scanner that offers native configurable DICOM, JPEG, and JPEG-XL output. This is a world-first for a pathology scanner. This new feature will allow for increased flexibility, interoperability, and image quality in pathology workflows.</p>
  <p>The Philips Digital Pathology Scanner is designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of pathology services. The scanner's ability to natively output in DICOM, JPEG, and JPEG-XL formats addresses the growing demand for seamless integration with hospital systems and the need for high-quality image storage and sharing.</p>
  <p>DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) is the standard for handling, storing, printing, and transmitting information in medical imaging. The integration of native DICOM output streamlines the integration of pathology images into hospital PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication Systems) and other clinical data management systems. This enhances interoperability and facilitates better collaboration among healthcare professionals.</p>
  <p>The inclusion of JPEG and JPEG-XL output options provides flexibility in image compression and quality. JPEG-XL, in particular, offers improved compression efficiency and image quality compared to traditional JPEG, which can be useful for archiving and sharing large pathology images. The ability to configure these output options allows pathology labs to optimize image settings based on their specific needs and storage capabilities.</p>
  <p>The Philips Digital Pathology Scanner aims to improve workflows by providing high-quality images that can be easily integrated into existing systems, reducing the need for manual conversion and ensuring compatibility across different platforms. This announcement highlights Philips' commitment to innovation in digital pathology and its focus on providing solutions that meet the evolving needs of healthcare providers.</p>
