    <h2>GM Is Pushing Hard to Tank California&#39;s EV Mandate</h2>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The article discusses California's mandate to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035, a move designed to aggressively push the transition to electric vehicles (EVs). This mandate, implemented by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), has significant implications for the auto industry and the broader adoption of EVs across the United States. Several other states have adopted California's emissions standards, meaning this mandate could affect a large portion of the US car market. The mandate sets a schedule where an increasing percentage of new cars sold must be zero-emission vehicles, starting with 35% in 2026 and rising to 100% by 2035.</p>
<p>The auto industry is responding to this mandate with significant investments in electric vehicle production. Major automakers are planning to introduce numerous new EV models in the coming years. However, challenges remain, including the cost of EVs, the availability of charging infrastructure, and consumer acceptance. The higher price point of EVs compared to traditional gasoline cars is a barrier for many consumers. The limited availability of public charging stations, especially in certain regions, also raises concerns about range anxiety and convenience. Consumer acceptance is further influenced by factors such as driving range, charging times, and overall performance.</p>
<p>The article also touches on the potential impact on the electrical grid. A widespread shift to EVs will significantly increase electricity demand, requiring substantial investments in grid infrastructure to ensure reliability and prevent blackouts. The source of electricity used to charge EVs is also a factor in their overall environmental impact; if the electricity comes from fossil fuel sources, the benefits of EVs are diminished. Government incentives, such as tax credits and rebates, are playing a crucial role in encouraging EV adoption by lowering the initial cost for consumers. The mandate is expected to accelerate innovation in battery technology and charging infrastructure, driving down costs and improving performance over time.</p>
