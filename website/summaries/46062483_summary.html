  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
   The article discusses the likelihood of Google implementing Airdrop support on the Pixel 10, driven by the EU's ruling on Apple's anti-competitive behavior. It begins by highlighting the potential for interoperability between Android and iOS devices. It suggests that the EU's regulatory pressure on Apple to open up its ecosystem is a key factor. The author believes this will level the playing field for cross-platform communication.

   The article emphasizes that the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) is pushing Apple to allow alternative app stores and messaging interoperability, indirectly benefiting Android users. The expected integration of Airdrop-like functionality into Android would enable seamless file sharing between Android and iOS devices, something previously limited due to Apple's closed ecosystem.

   The author speculates that the Pixel 10, expected to be released in 2025, is a likely candidate for showcasing this new interoperability. It notes that Google has already been working on improving file sharing between Android devices with features like Nearby Share, which could be expanded to include iOS devices.
