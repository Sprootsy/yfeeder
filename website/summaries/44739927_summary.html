The city of Vicenza, Italy, is migrating its 1,200 PCs from Microsoft Windows and Office to Linux and OnlyOffice. This transition aims to reduce costs, enhance security, and achieve greater digital independence. They expect to save significant licensing fees annually.
</p>
<p>
The migration involves replacing Windows with a Linux distribution and Microsoft Office with OnlyOffice, a collaborative office suite compatible with Microsoft Office formats. The city previously used LibreOffice but found OnlyOffice better suited for their needs, particularly its compatibility with existing documents and collaborative features.
</p>
<p>
Vicenza's IT department is managing the migration, which includes training employees on the new software. The phased approach ensures a smooth transition, minimizing disruption to city services. The choice of Linux and OnlyOffice aligns with a broader trend among European public administrations seeking open-source alternatives to proprietary software.
</p>
<p>
The key reasons behind the move include the high costs associated with Microsoft licenses, concerns about vendor lock-in, and the desire for greater control over their IT infrastructure. The open-source nature of Linux and OnlyOffice allows the city to customize and adapt the software to their specific requirements, offering greater flexibility and security. Additionally, the adoption of open standards ensures better interoperability and reduces dependence on a single vendor.
</p>
<p>
Vicenza's initiative mirrors similar migrations in other European cities, driven by the desire for cost savings, enhanced security, and digital sovereignty. The move is a strategic decision to invest in open-source solutions that provide long-term benefits and align with the city's digital transformation goals.
