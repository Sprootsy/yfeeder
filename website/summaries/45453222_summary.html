<p>The article "Why Stick to Emacs? - Blog" is a personal reflection on the author's continued use of Emacs, a text editor and integrated development environment, despite its age and perceived complexity. The author explores the reasons why, after trying other modern editors and IDEs, they always return to Emacs.</p>

<p>The author initially acknowledges Emacs' steep learning curve and the common perception that it is outdated and difficult to configure. However, they argue that Emacs' unique strengths outweigh these drawbacks. The core of the author's argument centers around Emacs' customizability and extensibility. The editor is built around the Emacs Lisp programming language, allowing users to modify nearly every aspect of its behavior. This extreme level of control empowers users to tailor the editor to their precise needs and workflows.</p>

<p>One key aspect of Emacs' customizability is its package management system, which allows users to easily install and manage extensions that add new features and functionality. The author highlights the extensive range of available packages, covering everything from programming language support to note-taking and project management tools. This vast ecosystem of extensions transforms Emacs from a simple text editor into a versatile and powerful environment.</p>

<p>The author emphasizes that Emacs becomes an extension of the user's mind, adapting to their specific way of working rather than forcing them to conform to a predetermined workflow. This is further enhanced by the ability to define custom keybindings and commands, allowing users to automate repetitive tasks and streamline their interactions with the editor.</p>

<p>The article also touches upon the social aspect of Emacs, mentioning the supportive community of users and developers who contribute to the editor's ongoing development and provide assistance to newcomers. The author notes that Emacs has a strong user base that is passionate about the editor and its capabilities. This community is also responsible for the creation of many of the extensions that make Emacs such a powerful tool.</p>

<p>Another reason given for sticking with Emacs is its plain text-centric approach. Emacs excels at handling plain text files, which are often used for configuration files, code, and other types of documents. The author suggests that Emacs' focus on plain text makes it a timeless and versatile tool that is not tied to any particular file format or application.</p>

<p>The author also values the freedom and control that Emacs provides. Unlike many modern editors that are controlled by corporations, Emacs is free and open-source software. This means that users have the freedom to modify and distribute the editor as they see fit. The author appreciates this level of control and independence.</p>

<p>In summary, the author justifies their continued use of Emacs by highlighting its customizability, extensibility, vibrant community, plain text focus, and the freedom it offers. They acknowledge its initial learning curve but argue that the long-term benefits of mastering Emacs far outweigh the initial investment of time and effort. By tailoring Emacs to their specific needs, the author has created a personalized and efficient environment that enhances their productivity and creativity. Ultimately, the author believes that Emacs is more than just a text editor; it is a powerful tool that empowers users to take control of their computing environment.</p>
