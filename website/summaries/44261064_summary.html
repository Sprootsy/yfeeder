    On April 2, 2024, Cloudflare experienced a significant incident that impacted a portion of their global network. Beginning at 14:38 UTC, customers may have experienced increased error rates and service degradation across Cloudflare products. The incident was caused by a software deployment that inadvertently introduced a flawed regular expression, leading to excessive CPU utilization on affected machines.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Cloudflare team identified the root cause and initiated a rollback of the problematic deployment at 15:12 UTC. As the rollback progressed, service performance gradually recovered. By 15:50 UTC, the rollback was completed, and the incident was declared resolved.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the incident, Cloudflare's engineering and SRE teams worked to mitigate the impact and restore services. The status page provided regular updates to keep customers informed of the situation and the steps being taken to resolve it.
