  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article is a README file for RIFT (Reverse Engineering and Inspection Framework), a tool designed for disassembling, decompiling, analyzing, and inspecting binary files. RIFT aims to provide a comprehensive platform for reverse engineering, supporting multiple architectures and file formats, and offering features like interactive disassembly, decompilation, and debugging. It emphasizes extensibility through a plugin system, allowing users to add custom analysis passes, file format support, and architecture support. The README outlines the project's goals, key features, supported file formats and architectures, build instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines. It also touches upon the planned features and future development directions for the tool.
