  <p>
    Defuddle is a command-line tool designed to remove duplicate files from a directory, preserving only the most recent version. It is written in Rust and aims to provide a fast and efficient solution for decluttering files based on modification time. The tool operates within a single directory and identifies duplicates by comparing file sizes and SHA-256 hashes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The core functionality of Defuddle revolves around iterating through the files in a specified directory, grouping files with identical sizes, and then, within each group, comparing SHA-256 hashes to identify true duplicates. Once duplicates are identified, the tool retains the file with the latest modification timestamp and removes the rest.
  </p>
  <p>
    Defuddle offers several command-line options to control its behavior. Users can specify the target directory, run the tool in verbose mode for detailed output, and enable a dry-run mode to preview the changes without actually deleting any files. The tool also includes a progress bar to provide visual feedback during the file processing stage.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tool is intended to be used as a single executable. The provided information details its command-line interface, dependencies (specifically the `clap` crate for argument parsing, `indicatif` for the progress bar, `rayon` for parallel processing, `sha2` for SHA-256 hashing, and `walkdir` for directory traversal), and error handling. It also includes unit tests to ensure the reliability of the core functions like hashing and duplicate identification.
