<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The Apple Support article, "If you forgot your Apple ID password" provides instructions on how to recover or reset a forgotten Apple ID password. The article explains that you can reset your password directly on your iPhone or other trusted Apple device, or through the web.
</p>
<p>
The primary method discussed involves using a trusted iPhone or iPad signed in with your Apple ID. If you have a passcode enabled, the process guides you through resetting the password without needing to enter the old one. The steps involve going to Settings, tapping "Sign in to your [device]", selecting "Forgot password or don't have an Apple ID?", and following the on-screen prompts to reset the password.
</p>
<p>
If you've enabled "Stolen Device Protection", you might need to wait an hour before you can reset your Apple ID password using this method.
</p>
<p>
The article also details how to reset the password online using a browser. This process typically involves entering your Apple ID and answering security questions, or using two-factor authentication if enabled. Apple will send a verification code to your trusted devices or phone number to confirm your identity. The steps vary slightly depending on whether you have access to a trusted device or not.

For users who have Account Recovery enabled, the article outlines how to use this feature if you can't reset your password any other way. Account Recovery is an automated process that may take several days (or longer) to complete, but it is an option when other methods are unavailable. It may be necessary to enter a recovery key, or contact Apple Support.
