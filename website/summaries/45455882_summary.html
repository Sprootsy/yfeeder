<h2>Summary of the History of the Letter Yogh</h2>

<p>The article details the history of the letter Yogh (ȝ), a character used in Middle English and Scots. It originated as a modified form of the Old English G, and its sound values varied considerably depending on its position in a word and the surrounding vowels. The confusion arising from these multiple pronunciations and its eventual merging with other letters led to its eventual disappearance.</p>

<p>Initially, Yogh represented sounds like /g/, /j/, and the voiced velar or palatal fricatives, similar to the "ch" in Scottish "loch" or the "j" in Spanish "jota." In Old English, the letter G represented all these sounds, but scribes began to modify the letter to distinguish between the different pronunciations. The insular G, with a closed top, became associated with the sounds /g/ and /j/, while the Carolingian G, open at the top, began to be used for the fricative sounds. This Carolingian form is what evolved into Yogh.</p>

<p>The transition from Old to Middle English saw the Norman scribes, unfamiliar with the intricacies of Old English pronunciation, simplifying the orthography. However, Yogh persisted, though its usage became increasingly inconsistent. It could represent /j/ as in "ȝeaf" (gave), /g/ as in "ȝet" (yet), or the velar fricative in words like "bouȝe" (bough). It also appeared at the end of words and after vowels, often representing the /i/ sound, further complicating its pronunciation.</p>

<p>In Scotland, Yogh persisted for a longer period and had a more distinct role. It primarily represented the /j/ sound and the velar fricative, similar to the sound in "loch." Scottish printers adopted the letter Z to represent Yogh due to the absence of Yogh in their printing fonts imported from the European continent. This substitution is the reason why names like Menzies and Dalziel are pronounced with a /ŋ/ sound today, even though they are spelled with a Z.</p>

<p>The decline of Yogh in England was hastened by the influence of French and continental spelling conventions. The increasing use of the letter G for the /g/ sound and the introduction of digraphs like "gh" for the velar fricative gradually replaced Yogh. By the 15th century, Yogh had largely disappeared from English writing, its sounds being absorbed by other letters or represented by new combinations of letters.</p>
