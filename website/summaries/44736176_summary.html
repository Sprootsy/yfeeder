    <h2>Crush: Glamourous AI coding agent for your favourite terminal</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <p>Crush is a cross-platform terminal user interface (TUI) file manager written in Go, leveraging the Charmbracelet ecosystem (specifically Bubble Tea and Bubbles). It aims to provide a modern and intuitive file management experience directly within the terminal, addressing the common need for efficient file system navigation and manipulation without leaving the command-line environment.</p>

  <p>The project's README outlines its goals, non-goals, and current status. It emphasizes features like keyboard-driven navigation, directory browsing, file previews, and basic file operations (copy, move, delete). A key goal is to offer a seamless and visually appealing user experience within the terminal, taking advantage of the capabilities of modern terminal emulators.</p>

  <p>Non-goals are explicitly defined to manage the scope of the project. These include advanced features like file archiving/compression, network file system support (e.g., SFTP, FTP), and built-in file editing capabilities. The focus remains on core file management tasks.</p>

  <p>The README provides instructions for installation using `go install`, assuming a Go environment is already set up. It also mentions potential future installation methods like Homebrew.</p>

  <p>The "Inspiration" section credits Ranger as a significant influence on Crush's design and functionality, acknowledging Ranger's established role as a popular terminal file manager. Crush aims to build upon this foundation while incorporating the aesthetic and interactive advantages of the Charmbracelet framework.</p>

  <p>The document also mentions "Wishlist" items, which are features under consideration for future development but not part of the initial feature set. Examples include file filtering, bulk file renaming, and improved file preview capabilities.</p>

  <p>Overall, Crush presents itself as an actively developed TUI file manager focused on providing a streamlined and visually pleasing terminal-based file management solution using Go and the Charmbracelet libraries. It balances a commitment to core functionality with a defined scope, drawing inspiration from existing tools while carving out its own identity.</p>
