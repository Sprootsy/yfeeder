<p><b>Summary:</b></p>
<p>The Boring Company, founded by Elon Musk, has been fined nearly $1 million by the Washington State Department of Ecology for violations related to stormwater discharge at its Moses Lake tunneling site. The violations stem from the company's failure to adequately prevent polluted stormwater from entering the surrounding environment, specifically the Columbia River. The Department of Ecology found that The Boring Company discharged stormwater containing high pH levels and suspended solids, which can be harmful to aquatic life and water quality. The company also failed to properly monitor and manage its stormwater discharge, violating state regulations designed to protect water resources. The fine reflects the severity of the environmental damage and the company's repeated failures to comply with state environmental laws. The Department of Ecology emphasized the importance of responsible stormwater management to prevent pollution and protect Washington's waterways.</p>
