  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
   The article is titled "Trans Fatty Acids and Coronary Heart Disease". The article discusses the link between trans fatty acids (TFAs) and coronary heart disease (CHD). TFAs are unsaturated fatty acids that have at least one double bond in the trans configuration. They can be found naturally in small amounts in some animal products, but the main source of TFAs in the diet is partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (PHVOs). PHVOs are produced by the partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils, a process that converts some of the cis double bonds to trans double bonds. This process increases the saturation of the oil, making it more solid and stable and increasing its shelf life. PHVOs are used in a variety of processed foods, such as baked goods, fried foods, and margarine.

   The article reviews the evidence linking TFAs to CHD. Observational studies have shown that higher intakes of TFAs are associated with an increased risk of CHD. These studies have adjusted for other risk factors for CHD, such as age, sex, smoking, and cholesterol levels. Randomized controlled trials have also shown that TFAs increase the risk of CHD. These trials have compared the effects of diets high in TFAs to diets high in other types of fat, such as saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, and polyunsaturated fat. The trials have shown that TFAs raise LDL cholesterol ("bad" cholesterol) and lower HDL cholesterol ("good" cholesterol). TFAs may also increase triglycerides and lipoprotein(a), and promote inflammation, all of which may increase the risk of CHD.

   The article also discusses the sources of TFAs in the diet. The main source of TFAs in the diet is PHVOs. PHVOs are used in a variety of processed foods, such as baked goods, fried foods, and margarine. TFAs are also found in small amounts in some animal products, such as beef and dairy products.

   The article concludes that the evidence linking TFAs to CHD is strong. The article recommends that people limit their intake of TFAs. This can be done by avoiding foods that contain PHVOs.
