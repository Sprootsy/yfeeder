<h2>Summary</h2>
Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket is undergoing significant upgrades to enhance its performance capabilities. These upgrades primarily focus on engine improvements and the incorporation of subcooled liquid oxygen and liquid natural gas. The upgrades to the BE-4 engines involve increasing their thrust. These enhancements are expected to substantially boost New Glenn's overall performance, enabling it to lift heavier payloads and reach a wider range of orbits. The use of subcooled propellants, specifically liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid natural gas (LNG), increases the density of the propellants, allowing the rocket to carry more fuel in the same volume. This translates to a greater mass fraction and improved overall performance. The combination of upgraded engines and subcooled propellants positions New Glenn as a more competitive and capable launch vehicle in the increasingly competitive space launch market.
