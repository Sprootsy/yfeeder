   The article "How Wealth Dies" by Surplus Energy Economics explores the lifecycle of wealth, drawing parallels to biological organisms and applying thermodynamic principles to economic systems. It argues that wealth, like living organisms, is created, grows, matures, declines, and ultimately dies. The author emphasizes that wealth is not merely money but represents a claim on real resources and energy.

   The article posits that wealth creation is fundamentally dependent on the availability of surplus energy. It highlights the historical relationship between access to abundant and cheap energy sources (like fossil fuels) and periods of rapid economic expansion. Conversely, it suggests that declining access to surplus energy leads to economic contraction and the eventual decay of wealth. The article presents a multi-stage model of wealth's life, starting with its creation through innovation and the efficient utilization of resources. As wealth grows, it tends to concentrate, leading to imbalances and inequalities within the system. Mature wealth often becomes self-referential, prioritizing its preservation over continued creation and innovation.

   The author contends that the pursuit of endless growth is unsustainable and ultimately self-defeating. As wealth ages, it becomes increasingly vulnerable to internal contradictions and external shocks. The focus shifts from creating new value to defending existing assets, resulting in rent-seeking behavior and a decline in productivity. The article suggests that attempts to artificially sustain wealth through monetary policy or other interventions are ultimately futile and can even exacerbate the underlying problems.

   The decay phase of wealth is characterized by a decline in real productivity, increasing social unrest, and a loss of faith in the system. As the cost of energy rises and the availability of resources diminishes, the foundations of wealth erode. The author warns against the illusion that wealth can be preserved indefinitely through financial manipulation or technological fixes. Instead, the article suggests that societies must adapt to a future of declining energy availability by embracing sustainable practices, reducing consumption, and fostering resilience. The article implies that understanding the lifecycle of wealth is crucial for navigating the challenges of a resource-constrained world and for building more sustainable and equitable economic systems.
