The article "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?" is a philosophical paper written by Thomas Nagel in 1974. It explores the nature of consciousness and the limits of objective, physicalist explanations of subjective experience. Nagel argues that consciousness is fundamentally subjective, meaning that there is something it is like to be a conscious organism from that organism's perspective. This subjective experience, or qualia, is inaccessible to objective observation and description.

Nagel uses the example of a bat to illustrate his point. Bats perceive the world primarily through echolocation, a sensory modality that is very different from human vision or other senses. While we can understand the physical mechanisms of echolocation and imagine what it would be like to navigate using sound waves, Nagel argues that we cannot truly know what it is like to *be* a bat, to experience the world through its unique sensory apparatus. He claims that no amount of objective information about the bat's brain or behavior can give us access to its subjective experience.

Nagel criticizes reductionist approaches to consciousness, which attempt to explain mental states in terms of physical states. He argues that these approaches fail to capture the subjective character of experience. Even if we could perfectly correlate brain states with conscious states, we would still not know what it is like to have those conscious states.

The article acknowledges the difficulties in studying consciousness scientifically. Because consciousness is subjective, it cannot be directly observed or measured by external observers. However, Nagel does not conclude that consciousness is beyond the scope of scientific inquiry. He suggests that we need to develop new concepts and methods to study consciousness in a way that respects its subjective nature. He proposes that a more objective phenomenology might be possible, which would attempt to describe the general features of conscious experience without reducing it to physical terms.

Nagel's paper has been highly influential in the philosophy of mind. It has stimulated debate about the nature of consciousness, the limits of physicalism, and the relationship between the subjective and the objective. It remains a central text in discussions of qualia, phenomenal consciousness, and the explanatory gap.

<h3>Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Subjective Experience:</b> Consciousness is fundamentally subjective; there is something it is like to be a conscious organism.</li>
<li><b>Qualia:</b> Subjective experiences (qualia) are inaccessible to objective observation and description.</li>
<li><b>The Bat Example:</b> We cannot truly know what it is like to be a bat, to experience the world through its unique sensory apparatus (echolocation), despite understanding the physical mechanisms.</li>
<li><b>Critique of Reductionism:</b> Reductionist approaches fail to capture the subjective character of experience. Correlating brain states with conscious states is not enough to understand what it's like to have those conscious states.</li>
<li><b>Limits of Objective Science:</b> Objective science, as it currently exists, may be insufficient to fully understand consciousness.</li>
<li><b>Objective Phenomenology:</b> A more objective phenomenology might be possible to describe the general features of conscious experience.</li>
<li><b>Influence:</b> The paper has been highly influential, stimulating debate about consciousness, physicalism, and the subjective/objective relationship.</li>
