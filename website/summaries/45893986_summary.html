  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The article discusses the collaboration between the .NET MAUI and Avalonia UI teams to bring .NET MAUI applications to Linux and the browser. It highlights that while .NET MAUI is designed for cross-platform development targeting Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, it lacks official support for Linux and the browser. Avalonia UI, an open-source cross-platform UI framework, already supports these platforms.
  The collaboration involves using Avalonia UI as the rendering backend for .NET MAUI on Linux and in the browser via WebAssembly. This means developers can use their existing .NET MAUI code and skills to build applications that run on Linux desktops and within web browsers, expanding the reach of their applications without significant code changes.
  The integration is achieved through a new "handler" system within .NET MAUI. Handlers are platform-specific implementations of UI controls. By creating Avalonia-based handlers, .NET MAUI applications can leverage Avalonia's rendering engine and platform support on Linux and in the browser.
  The article also notes that this is an experimental project demonstrating the potential of the .NET MAUI architecture and the flexibility of Avalonia UI. It emphasizes that this collaboration is a community effort with the Avalonia UI team taking the lead in implementing the Linux and browser backends for .NET MAUI.
  The initial implementation will focus on basic UI elements and functionality, with plans to gradually expand support for more complex features. It is stated that the project is still in its early stages, and the teams are actively seeking community feedback and contributions.
  In conclusion, the collaboration between .NET MAUI and Avalonia UI represents a significant step towards true cross-platform .NET development, enabling developers to target a wider range of platforms with their .NET MAUI applications.</p>
