<div>
  <p>An Oklahoma City family is traumatized after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents raided their home, despite the family not being the target of the investigation. ICE agents arrived at the home on April 9, searching for someone they believed lived there. The family, including children, were handcuffed and held at gunpoint during the search. Despite the family's distress and insistence that the person ICE sought did not live there, agents searched the home for two hours. Ultimately, ICE did not find the individual they were looking for at the residence. The family is now dealing with emotional trauma from the incident and is seeking answers and accountability from ICE regarding the raid. </p>
