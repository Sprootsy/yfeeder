<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The article is about the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP). CAP is a framework of languages, libraries, and tools for building cloud-native, service-centric business applications on SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP). It guides developers with proven best practices and a framework that reduces boilerplate code, allowing developers to focus on the business logic.</p>

<p>CAP emphasizes a declarative and model-driven development approach. Developers define their application's data model and services using CDS (Core Data Services), a domain-specific language for defining data models and service definitions. CAP then uses this model to automatically generate much of the application's infrastructure and boilerplate code, including database schemas, OData services, and basic UI elements. This model-driven approach promotes consistency, reduces errors, and accelerates development.</p>

<p>CAP supports a variety of programming languages, including Node.js and Java, allowing developers to choose the language that best suits their skills and the needs of their project. It provides dedicated SDKs and libraries for each language, simplifying tasks such as data access, transaction management, and security. CAP embraces open standards and technologies, such as OData, REST, and JSON, making it easy to integrate with other systems and services.</p>

<p>CAP also offers comprehensive support for building user interfaces. It provides tools and libraries for creating both SAP Fiori applications and custom UIs. CAP integrates with SAPUI5 and other UI frameworks, allowing developers to build rich, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. Security is a central concern in CAP. It provides built-in support for authentication, authorization, and data protection, helping developers build secure applications that comply with industry standards and regulations. CAP integrates with SAP BTP's security services, such as the Identity Authentication Service and the Authorization and Trust Management service, providing a comprehensive security framework.</p>

<p>CAP facilitates testing and deployment. It offers tools for unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. CAP also simplifies the deployment process by providing integration with SAP BTP's deployment services, such as the Cloud Foundry environment and the Kyma environment. CAP applications can be deployed to a variety of environments, including on-premise, cloud, and hybrid landscapes.</p>
