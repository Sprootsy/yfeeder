<p>The article is a personal account by Colin Ruatta detailing his experience of being blocked from contributing to the Lodash JavaScript library. Ruatta, a maintainer of other open-source projects like Folktale and Sanctuary, recounts his initial enthusiasm for Lodash and his subsequent attempts to contribute to the library. He describes his journey, starting from identifying and fixing minor issues, to tackling more complex problems and proposing new features. He emphasizes his commitment to writing clean, well-tested code and adhering to the library's contribution guidelines.</p>

<p>However, Ruatta's contributions were met with resistance from the Lodash maintainers, particularly John-David Dalton, the project lead. He details instances where his pull requests were either ignored, delayed, or rejected with minimal explanation. He cites examples of his proposed fixes and improvements being dismissed without proper consideration, and of his suggestions for new features being outright rejected despite their potential benefits.</p>

<p>Ruatta expresses his frustration and disappointment with the lack of transparency and communication from the Lodash maintainers. He feels that his efforts were not valued and that his expertise was disregarded. He believes that the maintainers' approach was detrimental to the project's growth and that it discouraged potential contributors from getting involved.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Ruatta was blocked from contributing to Lodash due to what he perceives as Dalton's subjective and arbitrary decision-making. He reflects on the experience, questioning the maintainers' motives and the overall culture of the Lodash project. He acknowledges that maintaining a large open-source project can be challenging, but he argues that effective communication and collaboration are essential for fostering a healthy community and ensuring the project's long-term success. He contrasts his experience with his positive experiences contributing to other open-source projects, where his contributions were welcomed and appreciated.</p>

<p>Ruatta concludes by expressing his concern about the lack of diversity and inclusivity in the Lodash project and urging the maintainers to adopt a more collaborative and welcoming approach. He hopes that his account will serve as a cautionary tale and inspire other open-source projects to prioritize community engagement and contributor satisfaction.</p>
