  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The article is a newsletter issue from "Aether Mug" focusing on famous experiments in cognitive psychology. It highlights several key studies and their implications for understanding the human mind. The author introduces cognitive psychology as the study of mental processes like memory, attention, and problem-solving.
  </p>
  <p>
  One of the highlighted experiments is the <b>"cocktail party effect,"</b> researched by Colin Cherry in 1953. This experiment showed that people can focus on a single conversation even in a noisy environment, but also notice when their name is mentioned in another conversation, demonstrating selective attention.
  </p>
  <p>
  Another experiment mentioned is the <b>"encoding specificity principle,"</b> studied by Thomson and Tulving in 1973. The results of the experiment highlighted that memory is improved when information available at encoding is also available at retrieval.
  </p>
  <p>
  The author also discusses the research on <b>heuristics and biases</b> by Tversky and Kahneman. The article touches upon the "availability heuristic," where people judge the likelihood of events based on how readily examples come to mind, and the "representativeness heuristic," where people assess the probability of an event by comparing it to an existing prototype.
  </p>
  <p>
  Overall, the newsletter provides a concise overview of influential cognitive psychology experiments.
