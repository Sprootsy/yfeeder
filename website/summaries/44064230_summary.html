   <p>Glitch is undergoing significant changes to address its sustainability and ensure its long-term viability as a platform for creators. These changes involve adjusting the free tier, introducing new paid plans, and focusing on improving the core Glitch experience.</p>
   
   <p>Currently, Glitch provides resources for free, which has allowed for widespread access and creativity. However, this model is not sustainable in the long run. To address this, Glitch is introducing paid plans that offer increased resources and capabilities while adjusting the free tier to better suit its intended purpose.</p>
   
   <p>The adjustments to the free tier will involve a limit on the number of projects that can be actively running. Projects that are not actively being worked on or used will be "sleeping," which means they won't be actively consuming resources. Users can wake these sleeping projects at any time when they need them. This ensures that resources are allocated to projects that are actively being used, improving overall performance and sustainability.</p>
   
   <p>The introduction of paid plans provides users with options to access more resources, such as increased storage, faster performance, and the ability to keep more projects active simultaneously. These plans are designed to cater to different user needs, from hobbyists to professional developers.</p>
   
   <p>Glitch is also committed to improving the core platform experience. This includes focusing on reliability, performance, and user-friendliness. The goal is to make Glitch an even better environment for creating and sharing web applications.</p>
   
   <p>The changes are being implemented with careful consideration for the Glitch community. Glitch is actively seeking feedback from users and is committed to providing clear communication throughout the transition. The aim is to balance the need for sustainability with the desire to maintain the open and accessible nature of the platform.</p>
 
   <p>In summary, the changes coming to Glitch are designed to ensure its long-term sustainability by introducing paid plans, adjusting the free tier, and focusing on core platform improvements. These changes will help Glitch continue to provide a valuable service to its community of creators while ensuring that the platform remains viable for years to come.</p>
