<p>The article "Operators, Not Users and Programmers" by Jyn argues against the common framing of software interaction as being between "users" and "programmers." It proposes that a more accurate and productive model is to view those interacting with software as "operators" who are engaging in a collaborative relationship with the software's creator. The author contends that the "user" framing carries negative connotations and assumptions that hinder software development and adoption, while the "operator" framing promotes a more nuanced and beneficial understanding of the interaction.</p>

<p>The piece criticizes the implicit power dynamic embedded in the "user" terminology. It suggests that "user" implies a passive role, where individuals are merely consuming a product created by someone else. This can lead to a disconnect between the developers and those who ultimately use the software, hindering feedback loops and innovation. The author argues that the "user" label can also foster a sense of entitlement, where individuals expect software to perfectly meet their needs without considering the complexities of its design and maintenance.</p>

<p>In contrast, the article champions the term "operator" as a more empowering and accurate representation of the individual interacting with the software. An "operator" is seen as someone actively involved in the system, contributing to its function and performance. This framing emphasizes the collaborative aspect of software interaction, where operators provide valuable feedback, identify bugs, and contribute to the evolution of the software through their usage patterns and requests. It also suggests a level of responsibility and understanding on the part of the operator, recognizing that software is a complex tool that requires skill and attention to use effectively.</p>

<p>The author highlights that viewing individuals as "operators" encourages developers to design software with greater transparency and understandability. Instead of treating operators as passive consumers, developers are incentivized to provide tools and documentation that enable operators to better understand the system's inner workings and contribute to its improvement. This can lead to more robust, adaptable, and user-friendly software.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the article suggests that the "operator" framing can improve the relationship between developers and the people using their software. By recognizing the active role of operators, developers are more likely to value their feedback and treat them as collaborators rather than mere end-users. This can foster a sense of community around the software, leading to greater user satisfaction and long-term adoption.</p>

<p>The author also touches on the historical context of the "user" label, noting its origins in older, more centralized computing models. They argue that in today's decentralized and collaborative software landscape, the "user" framing is increasingly outdated and inaccurate. The rise of open-source software and collaborative development practices further supports the idea that individuals interacting with software are not simply passive consumers but active participants in its creation and evolution.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the article advocates for a shift in perspective from "users" to "operators" as a way to improve software design, development, and adoption. By recognizing the active role and collaborative potential of those interacting with software, developers can create more robust, user-friendly, and community-driven products.</p>
