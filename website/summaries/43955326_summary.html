  <p>This webpage serves as a course page for Physics 136, which appears to be a course at Caltech during the year 2012. The listed information encompasses various aspects of the course, including the schedule, lecture notes, homework assignments, and other relevant resources. </p>
  
  <p>The course content seems structured around several core topics in theoretical physics. Based on the filenames of lecture notes, key subjects covered may include: Lagrangian mechanics, Hamiltonian mechanics, canonical transformations, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, perturbation theory, stability analysis, and the theory of continuous systems/fields.</p>

  <p>The "Schedule" link likely outlines the specific dates for lectures, homework due dates, and possibly exams or other important course milestones. The lecture notes are presumably transcripts or summaries of the material presented in class, serving as a valuable study aid for students. Each homework assignment aims to let students practice solving problems related to the lecture material.</p>

  <p>Given the topics mentioned, Physics 136 is likely an advanced undergraduate or graduate-level course in classical mechanics, possibly with an emphasis on mathematical formalism and analytical techniques. It builds upon introductory mechanics concepts, delving into more sophisticated approaches and applications.</p>

  <p>In summary, the webpage offers a comprehensive resource hub for students enrolled in the Physics 136 course. It contains the essential materials required to navigate and succeed in the course, from the schedule and lecture notes to homework assignments.</p>
