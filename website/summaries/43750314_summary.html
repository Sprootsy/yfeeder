        <h1>Regex Isn&#39;t Hard (2023)</h1>
        <p>
 <div>
  <p>The article is a comprehensive guide to understanding and using regular expressions (regex). It begins by explaining the fundamental concept of what regex is: a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It emphasizes that regex is not a programming language but a pattern-matching tool used across various programming languages and tools.</p>
  <p>The article then delves into the basic building blocks of regex, starting with literal characters, which simply match the exact characters written in the pattern. It moves on to character classes, which allow you to match any one character from a specified set, such as `[aeiou]` for any vowel or `[0-9]` for any digit. Shorthand character classes like `\d` for digits, `\w` for word characters (letters, numbers, and underscore), and `\s` for whitespace characters are also explained, along with their negated counterparts (`\D`, `\W`, `\S`).</p>
  <p>Anchors are covered next, focusing on how to match the beginning (`^`) or end (`$`) of a string or line. Quantifiers are then introduced, which control how many times a character or group should be repeated. These include `*` (zero or more times), `+` (one or more times), `?` (zero or one time), and `{n,m}` (between `n` and `m` times).  The concept of greediness in quantifiers is highlighted, explaining that by default, they match as much as possible.</p>
  <p>The article explains the use of the OR operator (`|`) to match one of several alternatives.  It then describes grouping with parentheses `()` to treat multiple characters as a single unit.  Grouping also enables capturing, where the matched portion of the string can be extracted for later use.  Non-capturing groups, denoted by `(?:...)`, are mentioned as a way to group without capturing the match.</p>
  <p>Character escaping using the backslash (`\`) is discussed, explaining how to match special characters like `.`, `*`, or `\` themselves.  The concept of backreferences (`\1`, `\2`, etc.) is introduced, which allows you to match the same text that was previously matched by a capturing group.</p>
  <p>The article also touches on more advanced features like lookarounds (lookahead and lookbehind), which allow you to match a pattern based on what precedes or follows it without including the surrounding text in the match. Positive and negative lookaheads (`(?=...)` and `(?!...)`) and lookbehinds (`(?<=...)` and `(?<!...)`) are briefly explained.</p>
  <p>Finally, the article offers practical advice on constructing and testing regex patterns. It recommends using online regex testers like Regex101 to experiment and refine patterns.  The importance of breaking down complex patterns into smaller, more manageable parts is emphasized.  It suggests starting with a clear understanding of the problem and then building the regex incrementally, testing each step along the way.</p>
  <p>In summary, the article serves as a tutorial for individuals seeking to learn or improve their regex skills. It covers fundamental concepts, common syntax elements, and practical tips for effective regex usage, emphasizing a systematic approach to pattern construction and testing.</p>
  <h2>Key Points:</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>Regex is a pattern-matching tool, not a programming language.</li>
   <li>Literal characters match themselves exactly.</li>
   <li>Character classes (`[abc]`) match any one character from the set. Shorthand character classes include `\d`, `\w`, and `\s`.</li>
   <li>Anchors (`^` and `$`) match the beginning and end of a string or line.</li>
   <li>Quantifiers (`*`, `+`, `?`, `{n,m}`) control repetition. They are greedy by default.</li>
   <li>The OR operator (`|`) matches one of several alternatives.</li>
   <li>Parentheses `()` group characters and capture matches. `(?:...)` creates non-capturing groups.</li>
   <li>Backslashes (`\`) escape special characters.</li>
   <li>Backreferences (`\1`, `\2`, etc.) match the same text as a previous capturing group.</li>
   <li>Lookarounds (lookahead and lookbehind) match based on surrounding text without including it in the match.</li>
   <li>Use online regex testers to experiment.</li>
   <li>Build complex regex patterns incrementally and test each step.</li>
