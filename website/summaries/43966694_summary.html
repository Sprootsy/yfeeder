    This article guides readers on building a local, on-device voice assistant similar to Siri using open-source tools. It emphasizes privacy and customization, as the entire system runs locally without relying on cloud services. The tutorial focuses on using tools that allow for speech-to-text, intent recognition, and text-to-speech functionalities.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article starts by outlining the benefits of having a local voice assistant, such as enhanced privacy, no dependence on internet connectivity, and the ability to deeply customize the assistant's behavior and responses. It then introduces the core components required to build such a system.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first component is Speech-to-Text (STT), which converts spoken language into text. The article suggests using tools like Whisper, an open-source speech recognition system.
  </p>
    <p>
    Next is Intent Recognition, which involves understanding the user's intent from the transcribed text. This can be achieved using tools like Rhasspy, which is specifically designed for offline voice assistants, or general-purpose Natural Language Understanding (NLU) libraries.
  </p>
  <p>
    The third component is Text-to-Speech (TTS), which converts the assistant's text responses back into spoken language. The article recommends using tools like Piper.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article provides a high-level overview of how these components can be integrated. The user speaks, the STT component transcribes the speech, the NLU component identifies the intent, and the TTS component generates the spoken response.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article then touches upon the practical aspects of setting up each component, including installation, configuration, and basic usage examples.
