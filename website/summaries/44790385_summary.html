    <h2>Passkeys are just passwords that require a password manager</h2>

  <p>This article by Dan Fabulich argues that passkeys, while promising a more secure and user-friendly future for authentication, are essentially just another form of password that require a password manager. The author contends that passkeys, like passwords, are long, random strings that users cannot realistically memorize and therefore must be stored and managed by a dedicated tool.</p>
  <p>Fabulich explains that the core problem with passwords lies not in their inherent insecurity, but in the way humans handle them. People tend to choose weak, easily guessable passwords, reuse them across multiple sites, and struggle to remember them. Passkeys aim to solve these problems by generating strong, unique credentials and storing them securely on the user's device (or in a cloud-synced password manager). However, the author points out that users still need a mechanism to access and manage these passkeys, bringing them back to the realm of password management.</p>
  <p>The article highlights that passkeys, in their current implementation, rely heavily on the underlying operating system's credential management system or a third-party password manager. This means that users are still entrusting their authentication secrets to a piece of software, albeit one designed with security in mind. The author also raises concerns about the potential for vendor lock-in, as different platforms and password managers may implement passkey storage and synchronization in incompatible ways.</p>
  <p>Fabulich acknowledges the benefits of passkeys, such as phishing resistance and the elimination of the need to type in passwords manually. However, he argues that these benefits are primarily realized because passkeys are effectively managed by a password manager, rather than due to any fundamental difference in the underlying credential itself. He also notes that many of the security advantages of passkeys can be achieved with existing password manager technology, such as strong password generation and automatic filling.</p>
  <p>The author concludes that passkeys are not a radical departure from the password paradigm, but rather an evolution of it. They represent a more secure and user-friendly way to manage authentication credentials, but they still rely on the core concept of a secret key that must be stored and protected. Fabulich suggests that the focus should be on improving password managers and promoting their widespread adoption, rather than viewing passkeys as a complete replacement for passwords.</p>
