<p>According to a report from <i>AppleInsider</i>, Apple's Chief AI Officer, John Giannandrea, is reportedly retiring in early 2025. The article attributes this retirement to the perceived failure of Siri and Apple's slow progress in the field of artificial intelligence compared to competitors like Google and OpenAI. Giannandrea joined Apple in 2018 with the aim of improving Siri and Apple's overall AI strategy. Despite his efforts and investments in AI, Siri has remained largely unchanged and has not kept pace with advancements made by other AI assistants and large language models.</p>

<p>The report suggests that Apple's struggles in AI are due to a combination of factors, including a lack of clear vision, internal conflicts, and a risk-averse culture that has hindered innovation. Some sources within Apple believe that the company has been too focused on privacy and security, which has limited the data collection necessary for training advanced AI models. Others point to a lack of coordination between different teams working on AI, as well as a reluctance to take bold risks and experiment with new technologies.</p>

<p>The article emphasizes that Giannandrea's departure would represent a significant loss for Apple, as he is considered a leading expert in the field of AI. His retirement could further exacerbate Apple's challenges in catching up to its competitors in this critical area. The report concludes by noting that Apple is under increasing pressure to demonstrate its AI capabilities and that the company's future success may depend on its ability to overcome its internal obstacles and accelerate its AI development efforts.</p>
