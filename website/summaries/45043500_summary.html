He has been widely criticized by scientists and public health experts for his views on vaccines, which they say are dangerous and not supported by scientific evidence. Kennedy has also been accused of spreading conspiracy theories about other topics, such as the assassination of his uncle, President John F. Kennedy. Kennedy's views on vaccines and other topics are controversial, and they have been widely criticized by scientists and public health experts. It is important to note that there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that vaccines cause autism.
