  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>According to a CNBC article dated November 5, 2025, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been compelled to significantly reduce flight capacity due to a government shutdown. This action is a direct consequence of Congress failing to pass a funding bill, which has led to a widespread disruption of air travel across the United States.</p>
  <p>The shutdown has forced the FAA to furlough a large percentage of its workforce, including air traffic controllers and safety inspectors. With fewer controllers on duty, the FAA has been forced to space out flights and reduce the overall number of planes that can be in the air at any given time. This has resulted in widespread delays and cancellations, impacting both domestic and international flights.</p>
  <p>The reduced number of safety inspectors raises concerns about the potential impact on aviation safety. With fewer personnel available to conduct routine inspections and maintenance checks, there are fears that safety standards could be compromised. Industry experts are warning of potential risks and urging Congress to resolve the funding impasse quickly to restore full FAA operations.</p>
  <p>Airlines are struggling to manage the disruptions, with many reporting significant financial losses due to the cancellations and delays. Passengers are facing long lines, missed connections, and uncertainty about their travel plans. The aviation industry is calling on Congress and the White House to reach an agreement to end the shutdown and restore funding to the FAA.</p>
  <p>The article also notes that the shutdown is having a ripple effect on the broader economy. The travel and tourism industries are particularly hard hit, with hotels, restaurants, and other businesses that rely on air travel experiencing a decline in revenue. The economic impact is expected to worsen if the shutdown continues for an extended period.</p>
  <p>There are reports of increasing frustration and anger among travelers, airline employees, and business owners. Many are questioning why Congress is unable to fulfill its basic responsibility of funding essential government services, especially those critical to public safety and economic stability.</p>
  <p>The CNBC report concludes by emphasizing the urgent need for a resolution to the government shutdown to mitigate the ongoing disruptions to air travel and minimize the potential risks to aviation safety. The article suggests that the longer the shutdown persists, the more severe the consequences will be for the aviation industry, the economy, and the traveling public.</p>
