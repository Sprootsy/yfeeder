        <h1>Open-source interactive C tutorial in the browser</h1>
        <p>
<div>
  <p>This article is a tutorial website dedicated to teaching the C programming language. It offers a comprehensive guide covering various aspects of C programming, starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced topics.</p>

  <p>The website's content is structured to cater to both beginners and those with some prior programming experience. It begins with an introduction to C, explaining its history, features, and advantages. It then guides the user through setting up a development environment, including installing a compiler and text editor, essential for writing and running C code. The tutorial covers fundamental concepts such as variables, data types (integers, floats, characters), and operators, which are crucial for performing calculations and manipulating data. It also explains input and output operations, demonstrating how to interact with the user and display results.</p>

  <p>The website delves into control flow statements like if-else conditions and switch statements, enabling the creation of programs that make decisions based on different inputs. Looping structures such as for, while, and do-while loops are explained in detail, allowing users to write code that repeats certain tasks. Functions are a key focus, with explanations on defining functions, passing arguments, and returning values, essential for modularizing code and promoting reusability. The tutorial further explores more complex data structures, including arrays, which allow storing collections of similar data, and strings, which are used for text manipulation. Pointers, a powerful and sometimes challenging concept in C, are thoroughly covered, explaining how to use pointers to access and modify memory locations directly.</p>

  <p>The tutorial also covers advanced topics such as structures, which allow grouping related data items together, and unions, which provide a way to store different data types in the same memory location. Dynamic memory allocation, using functions like malloc and calloc, is explained, allowing programs to allocate memory during runtime as needed. The site also provides guidance on file handling, enabling programs to read from and write to files, which is crucial for data persistence. Preprocessors and header files are also covered, explaining how to use preprocessor directives to control compilation and organize code into reusable modules. The site includes numerous examples throughout to illustrate each concept and provide practical applications.</p>
