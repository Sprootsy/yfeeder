 <h3>Summary</h3>
 <p>The article "Hiring Only Senior Engineers Is Killing Companies" argues that an over-reliance on hiring senior engineers, while seemingly beneficial in the short term, can be detrimental to a company's long-term health and growth. The author contends that companies often prioritize senior-level talent to quickly solve immediate problems, neglecting the crucial role that junior and mid-level engineers play in fostering innovation, building a sustainable engineering culture, and ensuring the future scalability of the organization.</p>
 <p>The article explains that a workforce composed exclusively of senior engineers can lead to several negative consequences. First, it creates a lack of diversity in thought and experience. Senior engineers, while highly skilled, often have established patterns of thinking and may be less open to new ideas and approaches compared to engineers earlier in their careers. This can stifle innovation and lead to stagnation within the company.</p>
 <p>Second, the absence of junior and mid-level engineers deprives senior engineers of opportunities for mentorship and leadership. Mentoring junior engineers helps senior engineers refine their own understanding of concepts, improve their communication skills, and develop their leadership abilities. Without these opportunities, senior engineers may become less effective in their roles and less engaged with the company.</p>
 <p>Third, a senior-heavy workforce can be extremely expensive. Senior engineers command higher salaries, and relying solely on them for all tasks, including those that could be efficiently handled by less experienced engineers, leads to an inefficient allocation of resources. This can strain the company's budget and limit its ability to invest in other critical areas, such as research and development or marketing.</p>
 <p>Fourth, neglecting junior talent hinders the company's long-term growth prospects. Junior engineers represent the future leadership and expertise of the organization. By failing to hire and develop them, companies create a skills gap that will become increasingly problematic as senior engineers retire or move on to other opportunities. This lack of succession planning can leave the company vulnerable and unable to adapt to future challenges.</p>
 <p>The article emphasizes the importance of building a balanced engineering team with a mix of experience levels. This approach fosters a culture of learning and collaboration, where senior engineers can share their knowledge and experience with junior engineers, and junior engineers can bring fresh perspectives and ideas to the table. A diverse team is also more adaptable and resilient, better equipped to handle unexpected challenges and capitalize on new opportunities.</p>
 <p>The author suggests that companies should actively invest in programs to attract, train, and retain junior and mid-level engineers. This includes offering competitive salaries and benefits, providing opportunities for professional development, and creating a supportive and inclusive work environment. By prioritizing the growth and development of all engineers, companies can build a stronger, more innovative, and more sustainable engineering organization.</p>
 <p>Finally, the article highlights the importance of recognizing that different tasks require different levels of expertise. Not every problem requires a senior engineer to solve it. By delegating appropriate tasks to junior and mid-level engineers, companies can free up senior engineers to focus on more complex and strategic initiatives, while also providing valuable learning experiences for less experienced engineers.</p>
