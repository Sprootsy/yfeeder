   <p>According to a Wall Street Journal report published on September 16, 2025, Oracle and a consortium including Silver Lake are set to control an 80% stake in TikTok's U.S. operations. This arrangement aims to address U.S. government concerns regarding data security and the potential influence of the Chinese government on the platform. The deal would involve establishing a new U.S.-based entity to manage TikTok's American operations, with Oracle taking a significant equity stake and handling data security. Silver Lake and other U.S. investors would also hold substantial shares. The restructuring is designed to ensure that TikTok's U.S. data is stored and managed within the United States, thereby mitigating national security risks. The agreement is contingent upon approval from the U.S. government, which has been scrutinizing TikTok due to its ownership by Chinese company ByteDance.</p>
