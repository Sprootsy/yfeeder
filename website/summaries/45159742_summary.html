    <h2>Campfire: Web-Based Chat Application</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <p>The article is about Once, a self-hosted, single-user version of Campfire, a group chat and messaging tool. Once was created because the original Campfire was being retired, and some users wanted to preserve their chat logs and continue using the Campfire interface. Since Campfire relied on a multi-tenant architecture, it was not possible to simply give users their data and let them run their own servers. Thus, Once was developed as a simplified, single-user application, capable of importing existing Campfire data and providing a similar chat experience.</p>

  <p>The core of Once is a Ruby on Rails application that provides a web interface for chatting. It includes features like user authentication, room management, message posting, file uploads, and search. It is designed to be easy to install and run, with minimal dependencies. The application uses SQLite as its database, simplifying deployment and eliminating the need for a separate database server.</p>

  <p>Once supports importing data from the original Campfire. This process involves exporting data from Campfire in JSON format and then importing it into Once. The importer handles users, rooms, and messages, preserving the chat history as faithfully as possible. The import process is designed to be robust and handle potential errors or inconsistencies in the data.</p>

  <p>The application is designed with a simple architecture, consisting of a Rails backend and a client-side JavaScript application. The backend handles user authentication, data storage, and API endpoints. The client-side application uses JavaScript to render the user interface, handle user interactions, and communicate with the backend. The use of Rails and JavaScript makes the application relatively easy to maintain and extend.</p>

  <p>Once is designed to be run on a single server, with all components running on the same machine. This simplifies deployment and reduces the complexity of the application. The application can be run on a variety of platforms, including macOS, Linux, and Windows. The installation process involves downloading the source code, installing the necessary dependencies, and running the application.</p>

  <p>Once provides a similar chat experience to the original Campfire. Users can create rooms, invite other users to rooms, post messages, upload files, and search for messages. The user interface is designed to be familiar to Campfire users, making it easy to transition to Once. The application supports features like message formatting, emoticons, and sound notifications.</p>
