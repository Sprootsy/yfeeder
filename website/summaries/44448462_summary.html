   This article is a review of the literature regarding cutaneous manifestations of monkeypox, now referred to as mpox, and provides a comprehensive overview for dermatologists and other clinicians. The review covers the changing epidemiology of mpox, particularly the shift from Central and West Africa to a global outbreak predominantly affecting men who have sex with men (MSM). It describes the virology, transmission, and pathogenesis of the mpox virus, including the differences between the Clade I and Clade II variants.

   The main focus of the article is on the clinical presentation of mpox, with a detailed description of the various types of skin lesions that can occur. It highlights that the presentation during the 2022 outbreak often differed from classical descriptions, with lesions frequently being fewer in number, localized to the genital or perianal area, and sometimes mimicking other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The review discusses the stages of lesion development, from macules to papules, vesicles, pustules, and finally crusts, and notes the potential for lesions to be painful or pruritic.

   The article also addresses the diagnostic methods for mpox, including PCR testing of lesion samples and serological assays. It emphasizes the importance of accurate and timely diagnosis to prevent further spread of the virus. Furthermore, it discusses the differential diagnoses that should be considered, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), syphilis, and other conditions that can cause similar skin lesions.

   The review provides an overview of the treatment options for mpox, including supportive care for mild cases and antiviral medications like tecovirimat for more severe cases or in immunocompromised individuals. It also mentions the role of vaccination in preventing mpox, with a focus on the JYNNEOS vaccine.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, the article underscores the importance of continued research and vigilance in monitoring mpox outbreaks and understanding the evolving clinical presentation of the disease. It highlights the need for dermatologists to be aware of the atypical manifestations of mpox to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.

   <b>Key Points:</b>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <b>Epidemiology:</b> Mpox has shifted from endemic regions in Africa to a global outbreak, primarily affecting MSM.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>Clinical Presentation:</b> The 2022 outbreak showed atypical presentations with fewer lesions, often localized to the genital or perianal area, mimicking STIs.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>Lesion Development:</b> Mpox lesions progress through stages: macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, and crusts. Lesions can be painful or pruritic.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>Diagnosis:</b> PCR testing of lesion samples is the primary diagnostic method.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>Differential Diagnosis:</b> Consider other conditions like HSV, VZV, and syphilis.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>Treatment:</b> Supportive care for mild cases; tecovirimat for severe cases or immunocompromised individuals.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>Prevention:</b> Vaccination with JYNNEOS vaccine is an important preventive measure.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>Importance of Awareness:</b> Dermatologists need to be aware of atypical mpox presentations for accurate diagnosis and management.
