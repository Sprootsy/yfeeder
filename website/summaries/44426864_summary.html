<p>The original source code for LZEXE, also known as the Kosinski compressor, has been released. LZEXE is a file compression tool initially created in 1989 by L. Lu and further developed by Marcin Kasinski. It became a popular method for compressing DOS executables during the late 1980s and early to mid-1990s, often used to reduce the size of programs distributed on floppy disks. Its significance lies in its widespread adoption within the demoscene and software distribution circles of that era. It allowed developers to package their programs into smaller, more manageable files, easing distribution and storage.</p>

<p>The release of the source code allows for deeper examination of the compression techniques used in LZEXE, offering insights into the algorithms and methods employed to achieve effective compression on the hardware available at the time. This is especially useful for those interested in retrocomputing, software preservation, and the history of compression algorithms. It also enables potential reverse engineering and adaptation of the code for contemporary uses or for educational purposes.</p>

<p>The code's release under a permissive license encourages experimentation and modification, fostering a community-driven effort to understand and potentially improve upon the original implementation. It's a valuable contribution to the historical record of computing, providing a tangible resource for researchers, enthusiasts, and anyone curious about the evolution of software compression.</p>
