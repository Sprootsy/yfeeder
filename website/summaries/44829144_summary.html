  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>
   The article discusses a mistake made by OpenAI's GPT-5 demo, specifically regarding the explanation of the Bernoulli effect. The author, a physics PhD, noticed an error in how GPT-5 described the physics behind a ping pong ball levitating in an airstream. The demo incorrectly attributed the lift solely to the Bernoulli effect, which states that faster-moving air has lower pressure. While this effect does play a role, it's not the primary reason for the ball's levitation in this scenario.

   The author explains that the dominant force responsible for keeping the ball aloft is the Coanda effect. This effect describes the tendency of a fluid jet to be attracted to a nearby surface. In the ping pong ball experiment, the airstream curves around the ball and, due to the Coanda effect, adheres to the ball's surface. This curvature and adhesion result in a change in momentum of the air, which, according to Newton's Third Law, creates an equal and opposite force on the ball, pushing it towards the center of the airstream and keeping it levitated.

   The article emphasizes that the Bernoulli effect is still present, as the faster-moving air above the ball does create a slightly lower pressure compared to the slower-moving air below. However, this pressure difference is not significant enough to counteract gravity and other forces acting on the ball. The Coanda effect, driven by the air's tendency to stick to the ball's surface and alter its momentum, is the crucial factor in this case.

   The author acknowledges that simplifying complex physics concepts is necessary for demos, but points out that the GPT-5 demo oversimplified to the point of being inaccurate. The author suggests that a more correct explanation should at least mention the Coanda effect as the main driver of the levitation.

   The piece concludes by reflecting on the challenges of explaining scientific phenomena in a clear and concise manner and highlights the importance of maintaining accuracy even when simplifying complex topics. It also subtly points out the potential pitfalls of relying solely on AI models for understanding physical phenomena without critical evaluation.
