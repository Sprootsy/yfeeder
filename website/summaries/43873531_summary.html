According to an article by Leonard David, remnants of an old Soviet Venus descent craft are expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere soon. These remnants are associated with the Venera missions, a series of probes sent by the Soviet Union to explore Venus. The expected re-entry poses a low risk to people on the ground. The object in question is orbiting Earth and its decay is monitored. No further details are given about the exact composition, size or mission of the object.
