  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The provided HTML code represents the scoreboard for the ICPC World Finals 2025. It is a dynamic webpage likely generated using JavaScript to display real-time standings of teams participating in the competition. The scoreboard is structured as a table, with rows representing individual teams and columns representing various metrics related to their performance, such as rank, solved problems, penalty time, and details about individual problem submissions.</p>

  <p>The table includes interactive features such as column sorting and team filtering. Users can click on column headers (e.g., "Rank", "Solved", "Penalty") to re-order the table based on the values in that column.  A search bar allows users to quickly locate specific teams by entering their name or a part of their name. The scoreboard data is dynamically updated with new submissions. A "Reveal All" button gives the option to show all teams that might be hidden by default.</p>

  <p>Each row in the table presents the following information for a team: their rank, team name, number of problems solved, accumulated penalty time, and a detailed breakdown of their submissions for each problem. Problem submission details typically include the submission time, the outcome of the submission (e.g., Accepted, Wrong Answer, Time Limit Exceeded), and potentially other information related to the submission attempt.</p>

  <p>The design includes visual cues to highlight various states.  For example, an "Accepted" submission is often indicated by a green background or a checkmark, while incorrect submissions might be marked with red. First solves may be highlighted. The penalty time is calculated based on the time of the first correct submission for each problem, plus any penalty points incurred for incorrect submissions prior to the correct one.</p>

  <p>The scoreboard is a critical component of the ICPC World Finals, providing a transparent and engaging way for participants, spectators, and organizers to track the progress of the competition in real-time.</p>
