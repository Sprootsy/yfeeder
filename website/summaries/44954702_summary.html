    <h2>Medical cannabis patient data exposed by unsecured database</h2>

   <h2>Summary</h2>
   <p>
     An unsecured database belonging to a cannabis software company,
     THSuite, exposed the private medical information of over 30,000
     medical cannabis patients across the United States. The database,
     which was left without a password or any security protections, contained
     highly sensitive data, including patients' full names, dates of birth,
     home addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, cannabis purchase
     histories, the amounts they purchased, and the medical conditions for
     which they were prescribed cannabis. In some instances, even scanned
     copies of patients' driver's licenses and medical cannabis
     recommendations were exposed.
   </p>
   <p>
     The breach was discovered by security researchers Noam Rotem and Ran
     Locher, who promptly notified THSuite about the vulnerability.
     THSuite, a company providing seed-to-sale tracking software for the
     cannabis industry, is used by dispensaries to manage inventory and
     patient information, raising serious questions about data protection
     practices within the burgeoning cannabis sector. The exposed data
     originated from several states where medical cannabis is legal,
     including Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Pennsylvania.
   </p>
   <p>
     The lack of security on the database meant that anyone with basic
     technical skills could have accessed the patient information, potentially
     leading to identity theft, blackmail, or other malicious activities.
     Given the stigma still associated with cannabis use in some circles, the
     disclosure of patients' medical conditions and cannabis use could have
     significant personal and professional repercussions.
   </p>
   <p>
     Following notification from the researchers, THSuite secured the
     database. However, the incident highlights the critical need for stricter
     data security measures within the cannabis industry, particularly as it
     handles sensitive patient information subject to HIPAA-like regulations in
     many states. It also underscores the broader importance of robust data
     protection practices for companies handling personal information,
     especially in sectors dealing with health-related data.
