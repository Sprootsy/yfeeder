  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    A team of researchers at Université de Montréal (UdeM), led by doctoral student
    Étienne Artigau, has confirmed the existence of a fifth planet orbiting the red
    dwarf star L 98-59, located 35 light-years away. This exoplanetary system is
    notable because it is the closest one discovered to date that resembles our
    own solar system.
  </p>
  <p>
    The initial discovery of three planets in this system was made by NASA's
    Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The UdeM team, using the
    Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRPS) installed on the European Southern
    Observatory's (ESO) telescope in Chile, has now confirmed the existence of a
    fourth and fifth planet. This is the first time a planet has been detected in
    this system using the radial velocity method, which measures the wobble of a
    star caused by the gravitational pull of its orbiting planets.
  </p>
  <p>
    The newly confirmed planets include L 98-59 e, which is only about 2.9 times
    the mass of Earth, and L 98-59 f, which resides in the habitable zone of the
    star. The habitable zone is the region around a star where temperatures could
    allow liquid water to exist on a planet's surface, making it potentially
    habitable for life as we know it. L 98-59 f is not the only planet residing in
    the habitable zone, as L 98-59 d was also found to be located in it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The L 98-59 system is of particular interest to astronomers because the planets
    are relatively close to their star, allowing for detailed study of their
    atmospheres (if they have any). The UdeM team's work has also provided valuable
    data on the planets' masses and orbital periods, allowing for a better
    understanding of the system's architecture. Future observations, particularly
    with instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope, could potentially reveal
    more about the atmospheric composition of these planets and whether they could
    potentially host life.
  </p>
  <p>
    The confirmation of these planets, especially the potentially habitable ones,
    makes the L 98-59 system a prime target for future exoplanet research. This
    research highlights the ongoing efforts to discover and characterize exoplanets
    and the potential for finding other habitable worlds beyond our solar system.
