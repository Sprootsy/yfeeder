  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    On November 3, 2023, GitHub experienced an incident affecting multiple services, primarily impacting Actions, API requests, Codespaces, and webhooks. The incident began at 15:17 UTC when GitHub detected elevated error rates.
  </p>
  <p>
    The initial impact was widespread, with users reporting issues across various GitHub functionalities. The team immediately began investigating, focusing on identifying the root cause of the increased error rates.
  </p>
  <p>
    By 15:44 UTC, GitHub identified a potential cause and began implementing mitigation steps. These actions aimed to alleviate the immediate pressure on the affected systems and restore normal service operation.
  </p>
