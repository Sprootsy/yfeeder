  <h3>Summary:</h3>
  <p>The article discusses the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles and argues that it has led to a worse experience for everyone. It focuses on how AI was implemented to optimize operations, from parking and concessions to security and crowd management, but instead created a tech-reliant environment that increased inefficiency. The author presents evidence of increased wait times, technological glitches, and an overall impersonal atmosphere. The article criticizes the move towards AI-driven solutions in contexts where human interaction and flexibility are crucial for a positive user experience, such as at live events. The author believes that BMO stadium, in pursuit of a tech-utopian ideal, diminished the actual experience for fans, staff, and ultimately, the community it serves.</p>
