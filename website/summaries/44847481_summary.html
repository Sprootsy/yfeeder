<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<p>The article "Empire of the Absurd" by Lauri Vahtre discusses the current state of Western civilization, arguing that it has descended into a state of absurdity characterized by a rejection of reason, tradition, and objective truth. Vahtre contends that this "empire of the absurd" is marked by a number of key features, including the dominance of ideology over reality, the embrace of relativism, and the suppression of dissenting voices.</p>

<p>Vahtre begins by observing a growing disconnect between official narratives and lived experience. He suggests that Western societies are increasingly governed by ideas and policies that defy common sense and produce demonstrably negative outcomes. This disconnect, he argues, is not accidental but rather a deliberate strategy employed by those in power to maintain control. The author points to examples such as counter-productive environmental policies and gender ideologies as examples.</p>

<p>A central theme of the article is the rejection of objective truth and the embrace of relativism. Vahtre claims that the idea that all perspectives are equally valid has become a dominant dogma, undermining the possibility of rational discourse and critical inquiry. This relativism, he argues, leads to a situation in which anything can be said and believed, regardless of whether it is supported by evidence or logic.</p>

<p>Vahtre also highlights the suppression of dissent as a key characteristic of the "empire of the absurd." He argues that those who challenge the prevailing orthodoxies are often silenced, ostracized, or even punished. This suppression of dissent, he contends, creates a climate of fear and self-censorship, making it difficult to resist the forces of absurdity.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the author touches upon the decline of traditional institutions and values. He suggests that the "empire of the absurd" is actively dismantling the foundations of Western civilization, including the family, religion, and the nation-state. This dismantling, he argues, leaves individuals isolated and vulnerable to manipulation.</p>

<p>Vahtre doesn't offer explicit solutions but implies a need to reassert reason, defend objective truth, and resist the forces of absurdity. He suggests that overcoming the current crisis will require a willingness to challenge the dominant narratives and defend the values of Western civilization.</p>
