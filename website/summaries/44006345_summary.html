<h2>Summary</h2>
The article introduces OpenAI Codex, a new AI system that translates natural language into code. Codex is the model that powers GitHub Copilot. It is proficient in Python, but also skilled in JavaScript, Go, Perl, PHP, Ruby, Swift, TypeScript, SQL, and even Shell. Codex is a descendant of GPT-3, but it has been trained on a dataset of code, including code from publicly available open source repositories.

Codex understands and generates code, enabling users to build working applications by describing what they want in natural language. This can drastically lower the barrier to entry for programming and allow developers to be more productive. The model can interpret simple commands to perform tasks such as creating a game or designing a website.

The article highlights the potential of Codex to revolutionize software development by making it more accessible and efficient. It details how Codex can be used in a variety of applications, including:

*   **Transforming natural language into code:** Users can simply describe what they want a program to do, and Codex will generate the corresponding code.
*   **Completing code:** Codex can automatically complete partially written code, saving developers time and effort.
*   **Explaining code:** Codex can explain what a piece of code does in natural language, making it easier to understand and debug.
*   **Translating between programming languages:** Codex can translate code from one language to another, which can be useful for porting applications to different platforms.

OpenAI believes that Codex has the potential to empower anyone to build software, regardless of their programming experience. They envision a future where coding is as easy as writing a sentence. They also believe that Codex can help professional developers to be more productive by automating tedious tasks and freeing them up to focus on more creative and strategic work.

OpenAI is releasing Codex through a private beta and is working closely with developers to gather feedback and improve the model. They are also exploring ways to use Codex to teach people how to code.
