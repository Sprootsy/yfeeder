<p>The article "Most People Who Buy Your Game Won't Play It" discusses the phenomenon of low game completion rates and the reasons behind it, as well as offering advice for game developers and marketers. It highlights the significant discrepancy between game sales and actual playtime, suggesting that a large percentage of players who purchase a game never finish it, or even play it at all.</p>

<p>The article delves into various factors contributing to this issue. One key aspect is the abundance of game options available to consumers. With numerous titles vying for attention, players often buy games based on hype, impulse, or future intentions, only to have them languish in their digital libraries due to time constraints or shifting interests. The "pile of shame," a backlog of unplayed games, is a common experience for many gamers.</p>

<p>Another factor discussed is the impact of sales and discounts. Games are frequently offered at reduced prices, leading players to purchase them speculatively, without a strong commitment to playing them immediately. This behavior inflates sales figures but doesn't necessarily translate into increased playtime or engagement.</p>

<p>The article also explores the psychological aspects of game purchasing. Players might buy games to feel a sense of ownership or to support developers they admire, even if they don't have immediate plans to play. The act of buying can provide a sense of satisfaction, regardless of actual game consumption.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the article touches on the role of game design in player retention. Games that are overly long, grindy, or difficult can discourage players from finishing them. Poor onboarding experiences, confusing mechanics, or a lack of compelling narrative can also contribute to low completion rates.</p>

<p>From a marketing perspective, the article advises developers to focus on engaging players early on and creating a positive first impression. This includes optimizing the initial gameplay experience, providing clear tutorials, and offering incentives to keep players hooked. Building a strong community and fostering a sense of belonging can also encourage players to invest more time in a game.</p>

<p>The author also recommends managing player expectations. Accurately representing the game's content and difficulty level in marketing materials can help attract players who are genuinely interested in the experience, rather than those who are simply drawn in by hype or discounts.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the article emphasizes the importance of understanding player behavior and tailoring game design and marketing strategies accordingly. By addressing the factors that contribute to low completion rates, developers can improve player engagement and ultimately create more successful and fulfilling gaming experiences.</p>
