 <div>
  <p>The provided text is a GitHub repository's README file for a project called `mcp-use`. The project provides a comprehensive and streamlined approach to managing and utilizing Mod Config Patch (MCP) configurations for Minecraft modding. The README outlines the purpose, features, usage, and contribution guidelines for the project.</p>
  <p><b>Description:</b></p>
  <p>The `mcp-use` project aims to simplify the application of MCP configurations to Minecraft mods. MCP configurations are crucial for defining mappings between obfuscated and deobfuscated names in Minecraft code, allowing mod developers to work with more readable and maintainable code. Managing these configurations can be complex, involving multiple files and manual steps.</p>
  <p>`mcp-use` addresses this complexity by providing a single command-line tool that automates the process. It handles various aspects of MCP configuration management, including:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Downloading and caching MCP data.</li>
   <li>Applying MCP configurations to build scripts (Gradle).</li>
   <li>Supporting different MCP versions.</li>
   <li>Providing a consistent and easy-to-use interface.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The tool integrates with Gradle, a popular build automation system used in Minecraft modding. By adding a dependency to the `mcp-use` plugin in your `build.gradle` file, you can seamlessly apply MCP configurations during the build process. The plugin automatically downloads the required MCP data, applies the mappings, and sets up the development environment.</p>
  <p>The README provides detailed instructions on how to install and use the `mcp-use` tool. It covers topics such as adding the required repository and dependency to your Gradle build script, configuring the MCP version, and running the tool. It includes code snippets demonstrating how to configure the plugin for both Groovy and Kotlin DSL Gradle build scripts.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the documentation emphasizes the tool's flexibility and customization options. Users can specify the MCP version, whether to use snapshot versions, and other configuration parameters to tailor the tool to their specific needs. The tool also supports caching of MCP data, reducing download times and improving build performance.</p>
  <p>The README also includes information about contributing to the project. It outlines the project's goals, coding conventions, and contribution guidelines. It encourages users to report bugs, suggest new features, and submit pull requests.</p>
  <p>In summary, `mcp-use` is a valuable tool for Minecraft mod developers who want to simplify the management and application of MCP configurations. It provides a command-line interface, integrates with Gradle, and offers a range of features to automate the process of applying MCP mappings, improving code readability and maintainability.</p>
