  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article discusses strategies for obtaining free or discounted internet access on cruise ships, focusing on circumventing the often expensive and limited official internet packages. The author emphasizes that while internet access on cruises has improved, it remains a costly service, making alternative solutions desirable.

    One primary method involves leveraging onboard promotions and loyalty programs. Cruise lines frequently offer free internet as a perk for booking certain cabin types, reaching specific loyalty tiers, or as part of promotional packages. The author advises potential cruisers to carefully examine booking offers and loyalty program benefits to identify opportunities for complimentary internet.

    Another approach involves utilizing internet access in ports of call. The author suggests researching cafes, restaurants, and public spaces in port cities that provide free Wi-Fi. This method allows passengers to connect for essential communications or browsing without incurring onboard charges.  However, this is dependent on the itinerary and the availability of reliable Wi-Fi in the ports visited.

    The article also explores the possibility of using personal mobile hotspots.  The author warns that this may be difficult or impossible due to the ship being too far from cell towers to get any signal.

    Finally, the author suggests that some cruise lines provide complimentary access to certain websites or apps. This may include the cruise line's own app or sites related to essential travel information. Passengers can take advantage of these free resources for basic needs.
