<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Perkeep, formerly known as Camlistore, is a personal storage system designed to let you keep, organize, and share your stuff for life. It prioritizes content-addressability, meaning that files and objects are named based on their content's hash. This ensures that identical files are stored only once, saving space and providing inherent deduplication.</p>

<p>The system comprises a set of open source formats, protocols, and software. At its core, Perkeep stores data in "blobs," which are content-addressed chunks of data.  These blobs are then organized using "permanodes," which are mutable objects that can be updated and annotated with attributes like titles, tags, and creation dates. Permanodes can point to other permanodes or blobs, creating a flexible graph structure to represent complex data relationships.</p>

<p>Perkeep offers several ways to interact with and manage your data. You can import files, photos, and other content using command-line tools or graphical interfaces. A key feature is its ability to automatically index and organize your data based on metadata and relationships. It supports tagging, searching, and browsing your content, allowing you to easily find what you're looking for.</p>

<p>The system supports various storage backends, including local disk, cloud storage services like Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage, and even other Perkeep instances. This flexibility allows you to choose the storage solution that best suits your needs and budget.  Replication features ensure that your data is safely backed up across multiple storage locations.</p>

<p>Perkeep is designed to be extensible and customizable. Its open API allows developers to build custom applications and integrations. It also supports plugins and extensions to add new features and functionality.  One of the main goals is longevity; the data should be accessible decades from now.</p>

<p>Key aspects of Perkeep include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Content-addressability:</b>  Data is named based on its content hash, ensuring deduplication and integrity.</li>
<li><b>Permanodes:</b> Mutable objects that can be used to organize and annotate blobs and other permanodes.</li>
<li><b>Flexible storage:</b> Supports multiple storage backends, including local disk and cloud storage.</li>
<li><b>Extensibility:</b> Open API and plugin support for custom applications and features.</li>
<li><b>Data modeling:</b> Ability to model data relationships using a graph structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, Perkeep aims to be a robust and versatile personal storage system that prioritizes data integrity, organization, and long-term accessibility.</p>
