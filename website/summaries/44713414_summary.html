    <h2>Visa and Mastercard are getting overwhelmed by gamer fury over censorship</h2>

  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The article discusses the challenges faced by adult game developers and platforms in processing payments, particularly highlighting the difficulties in obtaining and maintaining merchant services from major credit card companies like Visa and Mastercard. These companies often have vague or inconsistently applied policies regarding adult content, leading to payment processors dropping support for platforms and developers with little to no warning. This can result in significant financial and operational disruptions.</p>
  <p>The article details examples of these disruptions, focusing on the experiences of platforms like Steam and Itch.io, as well as individual developers who have had their payment processing capabilities abruptly terminated. While Steam has a more established position and resources to navigate these issues, independent platforms and developers are more vulnerable. The article highlights the reliance on alternative payment processors, many of which come with higher fees and less robust fraud protection, adding to the challenges for these businesses. It also mentions that the definition of what constitutes "adult content" can be subjective and varies between payment processors, leading to further uncertainty.</p>
  <p>The article explores the perspectives of different stakeholders, including developers, platform operators, and payment processors, to understand the complexities of the situation. It argues that the lack of transparency and consistent enforcement from major payment networks creates a precarious environment for adult game developers, hindering their ability to operate and innovate. It also suggests that, while chargebacks and fraud are concerns, the inconsistent policies and lack of communication disproportionately impact smaller businesses and independent creators.</p>
