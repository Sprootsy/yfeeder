  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article describes the Jotunn 8, a high-performance RISC-V vector processor IP core developed by V-Sora. It's designed for computationally intensive applications requiring high throughput and energy efficiency. The Jotunn 8 implements the RV64GV ISA, supporting the full vector extension and other key extensions like B, C, F, and Zfhmin, making it suitable for workloads such as AI/ML, image/video processing, and scientific computing.
  </p>
  <p>
    The core features an 8-way SIMD vector processing unit, enabling parallel execution of vector operations. It is highly configurable, allowing designers to tailor the core to specific application requirements. Configuration options include vector register file size, number of lanes, and memory interface width. This adaptability makes it suitable for a range of applications, from edge devices to high-performance servers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Jotunn 8 integrates a multi-issue out-of-order (OoO) scalar core that efficiently handles control code and scalar operations, maximizing overall performance. The vector processing unit can operate in parallel with the scalar core, further improving throughput.
  </p>
  <p>
    The IP core supports various memory interfaces, including AXI and TileLink, allowing for seamless integration into different system architectures. It also includes comprehensive debugging and tracing capabilities, aiding in software development and system integration.
  </p>
  <p>
    V-Sora provides a complete development environment for the Jotunn 8, including a software development kit (SDK) with compilers, debuggers, and performance analysis tools. This comprehensive support accelerates the development cycle and helps customers optimize their applications for the Jotunn 8.
