<h2>Summary</h2>

The article is about a newly discovered exoplanet called TOI 700 e, orbiting the small, cool M dwarf star TOI 700, located about 100 light-years away in the constellation Dorado. This planet was discovered using data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). TOI 700 e is close in size to Earth and is located within the habitable zone of its star, meaning it could potentially support liquid water on its surface.

TOI 700 e is not the first planet discovered in this system. TESS had previously discovered three other planets in the system: TOI 700 b, TOI 700 c, and TOI 700 d. Planet d is also located in the habitable zone. TOI 700 e is smaller than planet d and occupies a position between planets c and d.

The discovery of TOI 700 e adds to the growing list of potentially habitable exoplanets and highlights the importance of missions like TESS in identifying these worlds. Its relatively small size and location in the habitable zone make it a particularly interesting target for future observations to determine its atmospheric composition and potential for habitability. The TOI 700 system is one of only a few systems known to host multiple habitable-zone planets.

<h2>Key Points</h2>

*   **Discovery:** A new Earth-sized planet, TOI 700 e, has been discovered using NASA's TESS data.
*   **Host Star:** TOI 700 e orbits the small, cool M dwarf star TOI 700, about 100 light-years away.
*   **Habitable Zone:** TOI 700 e resides in the habitable zone of its star, where liquid water could potentially exist on its surface.
*   **Planet Size:** TOI 700 e is close in size to Earth.
*   **Multi-Planet System:** TOI 700 e is the fourth planet discovered in the TOI 700 system, which already includes planets b, c, and d.
*   **Another Habitable Zone Planet:** Planet d is also located in the habitable zone.
*   **Significance:** The discovery adds to the list of potentially habitable exoplanets and makes the TOI 700 system one of the few known to host multiple habitable-zone planets.
*   **Future Observations:** TOI 700 e is a compelling target for future studies to assess its atmosphere and habitability.
