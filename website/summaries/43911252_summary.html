  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

  <p>According to a <em>New York Times</em> article dated May 6, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Energy Star program has been eliminated. The program, which for over three decades helped consumers identify energy-efficient appliances and products, was a casualty of budget cuts and a shift in political priorities. The article details how the Energy Star label became a ubiquitous guide for consumers looking to save money on utility bills and reduce their environmental impact. It also explains the process by which manufacturers could apply for and receive the Energy Star certification for their products if they met specific energy efficiency criteria.</p>

  <p>The article explores the impact of the program's elimination. Consumer groups and environmental advocates express concerns about the loss of a trusted resource. They fear that without the Energy Star label, consumers will struggle to make informed decisions about energy-efficient purchases. This could lead to increased energy consumption and higher utility bills for households. Some manufacturers who had invested in developing energy-efficient products are also quoted, lamenting the loss of a valuable marketing tool.</p>

  <p>The article also investigates the political context surrounding the program's demise. It notes that certain politicians and industry groups had long criticized the Energy Star program. They argued that it was an unnecessary government intervention in the marketplace and that it imposed burdensome regulations on businesses. The elimination of the program is presented as a victory for these groups and a reflection of a broader trend toward deregulation.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the article examines potential consequences for energy efficiency standards and innovation in the appliance and electronics industries. Experts suggest that the absence of the Energy Star program could slow down the development and adoption of new energy-saving technologies. They also worry that it will weaken overall efforts to combat climate change.</p>

  <p>The <em>New York Times</em> article concludes by highlighting the uncertainty that now exists in the market for energy-efficient products. Consumers and manufacturers alike are left to navigate a landscape without the familiar guidance of the Energy Star label. The long-term effects of the program's elimination remain to be seen.</p>
