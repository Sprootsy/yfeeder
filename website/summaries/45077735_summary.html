<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Declan Fry's "Just a Little Longer" is a review of Claire G. Coleman's novel, *Enclave*. The review explores themes of climate change, surveillance, race, and class within the context of Coleman's dystopian narrative. The novel is set in a near-future Australia where the wealthy live in technologically advanced enclaves, shielded from the environmental devastation and social unrest that plague the outside world, where marginalized communities struggle to survive.</p>

<p>Fry examines how Coleman uses the dystopian setting to critique contemporary Australian society, particularly its treatment of Indigenous Australians and other minority groups. The review highlights the stark contrast between the privileged lives of the enclave residents and the harsh realities faced by those excluded from this protected environment. The ever-present surveillance and control within the enclave, while intended to ensure safety and order, also serve to stifle dissent and maintain the status quo.</p>

<p>The review delves into the character of Christine, the protagonist, who begins to question the values and assumptions of her enclave society. As Christine becomes increasingly aware of the injustices and inequalities that underpin her privileged existence, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery and resistance. Fry emphasizes the importance of Christine's growing empathy and her willingness to challenge the established power structures.</p>

<p>Fry also discusses Coleman's use of science fiction tropes to explore complex social and political issues. The novel's speculative elements, such as advanced technology and environmental collapse, serve as a backdrop for examining themes of colonialism, environmental degradation, and social stratification. The review notes the relevance of Coleman's work to contemporary concerns about climate change, social inequality, and the erosion of civil liberties.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Fry praises Coleman's novel for its thought-provoking exploration of these themes and its powerful message of hope and resilience. Despite the bleakness of the dystopian setting, *Enclave* suggests that resistance and change are possible, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of listening to marginalized voices and working towards a more just and equitable future.</p>
