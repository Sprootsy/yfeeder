 <h3>Summary:</h3>
 <p>On November 11, 2025, at 06:58 UTC, an X5.1-class solar flare erupted from sunspot region 3697. This was a significant event, being the strongest flare of Solar Cycle 25 to date and the strongest since 2017. The flare was associated with a Type II radio emission with an estimated speed of 1813 km/s and a Type IV radio emission, both indicative of a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME). SpaceWeatherLive.com noted that the location of the eruption was favorably positioned for a potential Earth-directed CME.</p>
 
 <p>Following the flare, a strong and fast CME was indeed observed in coronagraph imagery. Models predicted a high probability of the CME impacting Earth, with potential arrival times ranging from late November 12 to early November 13. Consequently, a G4 (Severe) geomagnetic storm watch was issued for November 13.</p>
 
 <p>The impact of such a geomagnetic storm could include widespread voltage control problems and protective system issues on power grids, potential damage to satellites, and disruptions to radio navigation. Aurorae could be visible as far south as Alabama and northern California.</p>
 
 <p>Updates from SpaceWeatherLive.com indicated that the initial analysis suggested a strong CME, and further analysis was ongoing to refine the arrival time and potential impact. The information provided is based on preliminary data and models and is subject to change as more data becomes available.</p>
