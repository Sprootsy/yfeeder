   <h3>Summary</h3>
   <p>
     The author reflects on the unexpected impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on their cognitive abilities and daily life. Initially excited about the potential of LLMs to enhance productivity and learning, the author has come to realize that these tools are subtly eroding their mental sharpness and problem-solving skills. They used to enjoy tasks like writing, researching, and learning new things, deriving satisfaction from the effort and cognitive engagement involved.

   <p>
     However, with LLMs readily available, the author finds themselves increasingly reliant on these models to generate text, summarize information, and answer questions. This reliance has led to a decline in their writing skills, as they no longer practice articulating thoughts and constructing arguments independently. The ease with which LLMs provide information has also diminished their research skills and curiosity. Instead of actively seeking out and synthesizing information from various sources, they now simply ask an LLM for a summary, bypassing the critical thinking and knowledge retention that comes with traditional research.

     Furthermore, the author observes a decrease in their ability to learn and retain new information. The instant answers provided by LLMs have made them less inclined to grapple with complex concepts and work through challenging problems. This lack of mental effort has resulted in a shallower understanding of subjects and a reduced capacity for critical analysis.

     The author acknowledges that LLMs can be valuable tools for specific tasks, such as automating repetitive processes and providing quick access to information. However, they caution against over-reliance on these models, emphasizing the importance of maintaining cognitive skills and engaging in activities that challenge the mind. They advocate for a balanced approach, where LLMs are used strategically to augment human abilities rather than replace them entirely. The author suggests consciously limiting LLM usage, making an effort to solve problems independently, and engaging in activities that promote cognitive growth. Ultimately, they argue that preserving our mental sharpness and intellectual curiosity is essential for long-term success and fulfillment.
