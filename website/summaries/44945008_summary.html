    <h2>Tiny-tpu: A minimal tensor processing unit (TPU), inspired by Google&#39;s TPU</h2>

  <p>The Tiny TPU project is an open-source initiative focused on creating a simplified, educational version of Google's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). The project aims to provide a platform for understanding the fundamental principles of TPUs and exploring custom hardware accelerators for machine learning. It consists of a software stack that mimics the TPU architecture, including a compiler, runtime, and simulator, and can be implemented on an FPGA.</p>

  <p>The documentation details the project's goals, design, and usage. The primary goal is to offer an accessible tool for learning about TPUs and experimenting with hardware acceleration. The design is based on a systolic array architecture, similar to the TPU, with a focus on matrix multiplication. The software stack includes a compiler that translates high-level machine learning operations into instructions for the Tiny TPU, a runtime that executes these instructions on the hardware, and a simulator for testing and debugging.</p>

  <p>The Tiny TPU architecture is described in terms of its key components: the Matrix Multiply Unit (MMU), the Unified Buffer (UB), and the Activation Unit. The MMU performs the core matrix multiplication operations. The UB acts as a high-bandwidth on-chip memory buffer, and the Activation Unit applies non-linear activation functions to the results. The compiler optimizes the data flow to maximize the utilization of the MMU and minimize memory access overhead.</p>

  <p>The documentation also covers the software tools and libraries needed to develop and run applications on the Tiny TPU. These include a Python-based simulator, a C++ runtime, and a hardware description language (HDL) implementation for FPGA deployment. The project provides examples and tutorials to help users get started with the Tiny TPU and build their own custom accelerators.</p>

  <p>The key aspects of the Tiny TPU, as presented in the provided documentation, are its open-source nature, its educational purpose, its focus on systolic array architecture, and its comprehensive software stack for compilation, simulation, and deployment on FPGAs. It serves as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and engineers interested in learning about TPUs and hardware acceleration for machine learning.</p>
