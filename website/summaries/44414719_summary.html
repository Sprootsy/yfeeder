  <p>The article is a research paper titled "Perceptual causality: How we experience the link between what we do and what happens." It explores the phenomenon of perceptual causality, which is the subjective experience of a causal relationship between one's actions and subsequent events in the environment. This experience plays a crucial role in our understanding and interaction with the world, influencing our sense of agency, learning, and decision-making. The paper investigates the underlying mechanisms that give rise to this experience. The researchers propose and test a computational model that integrates sensory prediction and temporal contiguity to explain how we infer causal relationships between our actions and their outcomes.</p>

  <p>The study uses a combination of behavioral experiments and computational modeling to examine how people perceive causal relationships. In the experiments, participants performed simple actions (e.g., pressing a button) and observed subsequent events (e.g., a visual stimulus appearing on a screen). The researchers manipulated factors such as the temporal delay between the action and the event, and the predictability of the event based on the action. Participants then rated the perceived strength of the causal relationship between their action and the event.</p>

  <p>The results of the experiments showed that both temporal contiguity and predictability significantly influenced perceived causality. People were more likely to perceive a causal relationship when the event closely followed their action in time. Furthermore, when the event was predictable based on their action, the perceived causality was stronger. The computational model successfully captured these effects by integrating sensory prediction and temporal contiguity. The model suggests that the brain constantly generates predictions about the sensory consequences of our actions. When these predictions match the actual sensory input, it reinforces the sense of agency and causality. The model also incorporates a temporal discounting mechanism, which reduces the perceived causality as the time delay between the action and the event increases.</p>

  <p>The authors argue that perceptual causality is not simply a matter of passively observing correlations between events. Instead, it is an active process involving prediction and comparison of predicted and actual sensory input. This active process allows us to learn about the causal structure of the environment and to effectively control our actions to achieve desired outcomes.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, the research provides insights into the mechanisms underlying perceptual causality. By combining behavioral experiments and computational modeling, the study demonstrates the importance of sensory prediction and temporal contiguity in shaping our experience of causal relationships between our actions and the world around us.</p>
