  <p>This page provides information and links to download the Curve25519 software. Curve25519 is a state-of-the-art Diffie-Hellman function designed for high speed and security. According to the author, Daniel J. Bernstein, it reaches speeds 10 times higher than widely deployed older systems. The page emphasizes the advantages of Curve25519, including its resistance to various side-channel attacks due to its design which allows implementations to achieve high speeds without compromising security. The page states the reference implementation is in C, and there are instructions for building and running the software. It also states that it is placed into the public domain to promote widespread adoption and interoperability.</p>
