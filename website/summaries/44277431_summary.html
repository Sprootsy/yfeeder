  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
   The article is a technical blog post discussing the implementation of a custom memory allocator, specifically tailored for high-performance scenarios and embedded systems. The author delves into the intricacies of designing a memory allocator from scratch, highlighting the challenges and trade-offs involved in balancing speed, memory utilization, and fragmentation.
  </p>
  <p>
   The author begins by outlining the limitations of standard library memory allocators (like `malloc` and `free`) in certain contexts, particularly their potential for unpredictable performance due to locking and general-purpose design. The article then introduces the concept of a custom memory allocator, which allows developers to fine-tune memory management to the specific needs of their application.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article goes on to explain the core principles of the custom allocator, which uses a fixed-size block allocation strategy with free lists. The memory arena is pre-allocated as a contiguous region of memory. This arena is then divided into fixed-size blocks, all of the same size. The allocator maintains a free list, which is a linked list of all the available (unused) blocks within the arena. When memory is requested, the allocator simply removes a block from the free list and returns a pointer to it. When memory is freed, the block is added back to the free list.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article elaborates on the data structures used to manage the memory blocks and the free list. This includes a header associated with each block, which is used to track the block's state (free or allocated).
  </p>
  <p>
   The author then describes the implementation details of the allocation and deallocation functions (`allocate` and `deallocate`). The `allocate` function checks if the free list is empty. If it is, it indicates memory exhaustion. If the free list is not empty, it retrieves the first block from the list, removes it from the list, and returns a pointer to the usable memory within the block. The `deallocate` function takes a pointer to a previously allocated block, adds the block back to the free list, making it available for future allocations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The blog post discusses the advantages of this custom allocator, including its speed (due to the simple allocation and deallocation logic and lack of locking), determinism (allocation and deallocation times are predictable), and suitability for real-time systems.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the author also acknowledges the limitations. The most significant limitation is the fixed-size block allocation. This can lead to internal fragmentation, where allocated blocks are larger than the requested memory, resulting in wasted space. Also, the total amount of memory is fixed at initialization. Another limitation is the lack of flexibility in managing different object sizes efficiently. All allocations must fit within the fixed block size, which can be inefficient if the application has objects of varying sizes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article then presents C code snippets illustrating the key functions and data structures of the custom allocator. This allows readers to understand the implementation details and potentially adapt the code for their own use cases. The code includes the structure definition for the memory blocks and the functions for allocation and deallocation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, the blog post concludes by summarizing the benefits and drawbacks of the custom allocator and suggesting scenarios where it might be a suitable alternative to standard library allocators.
