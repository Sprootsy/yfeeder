<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>Scott Aaronson's blog post "I Drank Every Cocktail" humorously recounts his experience attempting to sample every cocktail listed in "The Bartender's Guide" (1989 edition, by Trader Vic). He embarks on this ambitious quest after finding the book at a used bookstore, driven by a desire to explore the world of cocktails and perhaps find a new favorite. The post details the various challenges he encounters, from the sheer volume of drinks to the difficulty in acquiring obscure ingredients and mastering the techniques required for some of the more complex recipes. Aaronson uses a spreadsheet to track his progress, meticulously noting each cocktail he tries and his subjective rating of it.

The article is filled with humorous anecdotes about the often strange and sometimes disgusting concoctions he creates. He vividly describes the unusual ingredients called for in some drinks, such as apricot brandy, and the unexpected combinations that result. He is also frank about the drinks that were utter failures, and the ones that were surprisingly good. He also talks about the physical challenges of drinking so many cocktails, including the weight gain and general malaise he experiences.

Aaronson also reflects on the deeper meaning of his project. He considers whether he is simply indulging in hedonism, or whether there is something more profound to be gained from such an exhaustive and systematic exploration of a particular domain. He wonders if his quest is a metaphor for his approach to other areas of his life, such as his academic pursuits, where he similarly dives deeply into a subject, exploring every nook and cranny.

The post concludes without a definite resolution. Aaronson acknowledges that he hasn't completed his mission to drink every cocktail in the book, and that the project has become more of an ongoing hobby than a strict goal. Despite the challenges and occasional setbacks, he expresses a sense of satisfaction with what he has accomplished, and a continued interest in exploring the world of cocktails. He invites readers to share their own cocktail recommendations and experiences, turning the post into a collaborative exploration of the subject.
