 <h3>Summary</h3>
 <p>
  The article is a detailed retrospective on the development and legacy of the unreleased Bullfrog Productions game, "Dungeon Keeper 3". It delves into the game's conception, its troubled development, and eventual cancellation. The article begins by establishing the context of Bullfrog's history after its acquisition by Electronic Arts (EA), highlighting the creative tensions that arose from this corporate change.

 <p>
  It describes how "Dungeon Keeper 2" was a financial success but internally considered a flawed product, leading to initial reluctance to create a sequel. However, market demand and EA's pressure led to the commencement of "Dungeon Keeper 3". The game was envisioned with significant changes, shifting the perspective to that of the "good guys" and featuring a more expansive overworld setting, a stark contrast to the dungeon-confined gameplay of its predecessors.

 <p>
  The development process faced numerous challenges. The shift in perspective required a complete overhaul of the game's mechanics and aesthetic. The team struggled to adapt the established dungeon management systems to an overworld environment. Technical issues, particularly with the game engine and AI, further hampered progress.

  The article highlights the internal conflicts within Bullfrog, exacerbated by EA's influence. Creative differences among the team members and clashes with EA's management over design direction and resource allocation contributed to a chaotic development environment. The pressure to meet deadlines and EA's increasing control over the project led to compromises that diluted the original vision.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ultimately, "Dungeon Keeper 3" was canceled. The article attributes the cancellation to a combination of factors, including the game's troubled development, the departure of key team members, and EA's strategic shift away from innovative, experimental titles toward more commercially viable projects.

It emphasizes the game's potential and the innovative ideas that were never fully realized.
