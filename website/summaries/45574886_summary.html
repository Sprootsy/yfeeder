<h2>Summary of SpaceX Starship Flight 11</h2>

<p>The article is a live update of SpaceX's eleventh integrated flight test of its Starship spacecraft. The launch occurred from Starbase in South Texas. The goal of the flight was to achieve orbit, gather data during the flight, and execute a controlled reentry of both the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft. The Super Heavy booster successfully separated from Starship and performed a boostback burn, however, it experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly (RUD) – an explosion – before it could attempt a water landing in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>Starship continued its ascent, reaching space and demonstrating on-orbit operations. The article detailed the planned in-space engine relight test of the Starship, to prove the spaceship can restart its engines while in space, a key capability for some mission profiles. Initial reports indicated that Starship was performing well during its coast phase in space. However, during reentry, Starship also experienced a RUD, breaking up before reaching the intended splashdown point in the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>Despite the loss of both the booster and the spacecraft, SpaceX considered the flight a success because of the amount of data collected and milestones achieved. SpaceX views these flight tests as crucial for iterative development, learning from each flight to improve future designs and increase the likelihood of success. The company aims to use Starship for lunar and Martian missions, as well as satellite deployment and potentially point-to-point travel on Earth.</p>
