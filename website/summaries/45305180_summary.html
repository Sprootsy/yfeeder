<p>A new three-minute, at-home test developed by researchers at Ohio State University may help identify symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease years before a traditional diagnosis. The self-administered test, called the SAGE test (Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination), assesses thinking and memory skills. It was designed to detect subtle cognitive changes that could indicate early stages of cognitive decline. The SAGE test includes tasks such as word recall, visuospatial tasks, and assessments of problem-solving abilities. It is available online and can be taken at home, with results then reviewed by a physician. Initial studies suggest that the SAGE test can be effective in identifying individuals who may be at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, potentially allowing for earlier intervention and treatment strategies. Researchers emphasize that the test is not a diagnostic tool but rather a screening measure to help identify individuals who should undergo further evaluation.</p>
