    He begins by highlighting the daunting complexity of Warhammer 40,000, describing the vast lore, countless factions, and the sheer amount of information a player needs to absorb to participate.

    The author humorously recounts his past experiences with 40k, from painting miniatures to engaging in epic battles with friends. He reminisces about the time invested in building armies and learning the game's rules, drawing a parallel to the time and effort parents invest in raising a child.
