        <h1>Mathematicians just solved a 125-year-old problem, uniting 3 theories in physics</h1>

The article discusses the progress being made on Hilbert's sixth problem, one of the 23 mathematical challenges laid out by David Hilbert in 1900. Hilbert's sixth problem asks for the axiomatization of physics, meaning to provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for physical theories. The problem has remained largely unsolved for over a century, partly because it is extremely broad and encompasses many areas of physics.

The article focuses on recent work that aims to address a specific aspect of the problem: providing a rigorous mathematical framework for kinetic theory, which describes the behavior of systems with a large number of particles, such as gases or plasmas. Traditionally, kinetic theory relies on approximations and assumptions that lack a solid mathematical basis. Researchers have been working on deriving the Boltzmann equation, a central equation in kinetic theory, from more fundamental laws of physics, such as Newton's laws or the Schr√∂dinger equation.

One significant achievement discussed is the rigorous derivation of the Boltzmann equation for hard spheres from the underlying Newtonian dynamics. This derivation, achieved through years of work by several mathematicians, provides a mathematically sound foundation for understanding the behavior of dilute gases. The derivation involves dealing with the chaotic nature of particle collisions and controlling the errors introduced by approximations.

The article also mentions ongoing efforts to extend these results to more complex systems, such as plasmas, which involve charged particles and electromagnetic fields. These systems are described by the Vlasov equation, which is closely related to the Boltzmann equation. Deriving the Vlasov equation from first principles is a challenging problem, but researchers have made progress in understanding the long-time behavior of solutions to the Vlasov equation and their relation to plasma physics.

The work on Hilbert's sixth problem is not only of theoretical interest but also has practical implications. A rigorous mathematical foundation for kinetic theory can lead to more accurate and reliable simulations of physical phenomena, which are essential for various applications, such as designing fusion reactors or understanding atmospheric phenomena.

Despite the progress made, Hilbert's sixth problem remains a major challenge. Many aspects of physics, such as quantum field theory and general relativity, still lack a complete and rigorous mathematical formulation. The ongoing research in this area highlights the deep connection between mathematics and physics and the importance of mathematical rigor in understanding the fundamental laws of nature.
