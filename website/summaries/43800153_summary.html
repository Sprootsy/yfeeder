        <h1>Mathematicians just solved a 125-year-old problem, uniting 3 theories in physics</h1>
        <p>

  <p>The article discusses the ongoing efforts to solve Hilbert's sixth problem, one of the 23 mathematical challenges posed by David Hilbert in 1900. Hilbert's sixth problem calls for the axiomatization of physics, aiming to provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for physical theories, particularly mechanics and probability. The challenge lies in the inherent complexity and messiness of the physical world, which contrasts with the precise and abstract nature of mathematics.</p>
  <p>Unlike some of Hilbert's other problems that have been definitively solved, Hilbert's sixth has remained a persistent and multifaceted challenge. While complete success in axiomatizing all of physics remains elusive, significant progress has been made in specific areas. The article highlights the work of researchers who are applying mathematical rigor to particular physical systems, such as the Boltzmann equation in fluid dynamics.</p>
  <p>The Boltzmann equation, which describes the behavior of gases, serves as a model system for researchers attempting to bridge the gap between microscopic and macroscopic descriptions. It relates the movement of individual gas particles to the overall properties of the gas, like temperature and pressure. Deriving the Boltzmann equation from more fundamental physical principles, and proving its mathematical consistency, are central to Hilbert's sixth problem.</p>
  <p>Researchers like Laure Saint-Raymond are making strides in proving the validity and limits of the Boltzmann equation. Her work focuses on deriving the Boltzmann equation from more fundamental models of particle interactions. These derivations often involve sophisticated mathematical techniques and approximations, highlighting the difficulty of establishing rigorous connections between different levels of physical description. The goal is to show that under certain conditions, the behavior of a large number of interacting particles can be accurately described by the Boltzmann equation, thereby providing a mathematical justification for its use.</p>
  <p>One of the major challenges is dealing with the "loss of information" when moving from a detailed microscopic description to a more coarse-grained macroscopic one. The Boltzmann equation, for example, does not track the position and velocity of every single particle, but rather describes the overall distribution of velocities. Establishing a mathematical link between these different descriptions requires careful analysis and often involves assumptions about the nature of the interactions between particles.</p>
  <p>Another area of progress is the development of mathematical tools for handling the complex behavior of fluids. Researchers are working on proving the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the motion of viscous fluids. The Navier-Stokes equations are notoriously difficult to solve, and the question of whether solutions always exist for all possible initial conditions remains a major open problem in mathematics.</p>
  <p>The article emphasizes that Hilbert's sixth problem is not about finding a single, definitive solution, but rather about developing a framework for applying mathematical rigor to physical theories. This involves identifying the fundamental axioms of a physical theory, formulating them in a precise mathematical language, and then deriving the consequences of these axioms using rigorous mathematical methods. While a complete axiomatization of all of physics may be unattainable, the pursuit of Hilbert's sixth problem continues to drive progress in both mathematics and physics.</p>
  <p>The pursuit of solutions often involves strong assumptions, approximations, and a deep understanding of the relevant physical phenomena. It requires navigating between the desire for mathematical rigor and the need to capture the essential features of the physical world.</p>
