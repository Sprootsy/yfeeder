   According to this New York Times article from July 27, 2025, cost overruns and design changes have significantly increased the price of the new Air Force One aircraft, a project initiated during the Trump administration. The projected cost has ballooned to over $6 billion, raising concerns among lawmakers and the public.

   The article details how the initial contract, touted by then-President Trump as a cost-saving measure, has been plagued by modifications. These changes included demands for larger galleys, upgraded communication systems, and alterations to the aircraft's interior design, adding hundreds of millions of dollars to the final bill. Additionally, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, exacerbated by unforeseen global events, have further contributed to the escalating costs and delayed the project's completion.

   The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has issued several reports highlighting the lack of oversight and transparency in managing the Air Force One project. Critics argue that the initial contract was poorly negotiated and lacked sufficient safeguards against cost increases. There are also allegations of political interference, with some suggesting that certain design choices were influenced by personal preferences rather than operational requirements.

   The article explores the political fallout from the escalating costs. Republicans and Democrats have both expressed concerns, albeit for different reasons. Some Republicans criticize the Biden administration for not controlling costs effectively, while Democrats point to the Trump administration's initial mismanagement of the contract. The rising price tag has become a talking point in political debates, with some calling for a reevaluation of the project altogether.

   The delays in the Air Force One project have also raised questions about the current aircraft's reliability. The existing planes, which have been in service for decades, require increasingly frequent and costly maintenance. The article notes that the aging fleet has experienced several mechanical issues in recent years, potentially impacting the president's travel schedule and security.
  </p>

   The article concludes by examining potential options for addressing the cost overruns and delays. These include renegotiating the contract with Boeing, scaling back some of the planned upgrades, or even exploring alternative aircraft options. However, each of these options presents its own challenges and potential risks.
