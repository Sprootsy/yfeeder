  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article is a README file for a C library called libt9, which implements predictive text input, similar to the T9 system used on older mobile phones. The library allows users to input text using a reduced number of keys, typically a numeric keypad. The core idea is to map multiple letters to each key, and then use a dictionary to predict the intended word based on the sequence of key presses. The library appears to offer functionalities such as adding words to the dictionary, searching for words based on key sequences, and retrieving possible word completions. The README provides information on the library's features, usage, and licensing, but it does not give in-depth technical details about algorithms or data structures used.
