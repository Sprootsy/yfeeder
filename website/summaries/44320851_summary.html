<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The article on Texas Highways recounts the history of Juneteenth, a holiday commemorating the emancipation of enslaved African Americans in the United States. It explains that while the Emancipation Proclamation was issued by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863, it wasn't until June 19, 1865, that the news reached Galveston, Texas. On that day, Union General Gordon Granger issued General Order No. 3, which declared that all enslaved people in Texas were free. This event marked the de facto end of slavery in the state and became known as Juneteenth, a portmanteau of "June" and "nineteenth."</p>
<p>The article details how Juneteenth celebrations began in Texas in 1866 and quickly spread throughout the state and beyond. These celebrations often included parades, barbecues, prayer gatherings, historical and cultural readings, and family reunions. They served as a way for African Americans to celebrate their freedom, honor their heritage, and reinforce community ties.</p>
<p>The article also acknowledges the challenges and obstacles Juneteenth faced. In the Jim Crow era, many public spaces were segregated, making it difficult for African Americans to hold large celebrations. Despite this, Juneteenth persevered, often taking place in rural areas or private land. The holiday saw a decline in popularity during the early 20th century as many African Americans migrated to the North and West for better economic opportunities, and integration became a prominent goal of the Civil Rights Movement. However, Juneteenth experienced a resurgence in the 1970s, fueled by the Civil Rights Movement and a growing interest in African American history and culture. In 1979, Texas became the first state to make Juneteenth an official state holiday.</p>
<p>The article uses historical photographs to illustrate the evolution of Juneteenth celebrations, showcasing the diverse ways in which African Americans have commemorated their freedom and resilience. From early gatherings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to more recent parades and festivals, the photographs offer a glimpse into the enduring significance of Juneteenth in African American history and culture. The article emphasizes Juneteenth's journey from a local Texas tradition to a nationally recognized holiday.</p>
