    Zach Perk's blog post, "When Did AI Take Over HN," investigates the perceived increase in AI-generated or AI-influenced content on Hacker News (HN). The author aims to determine whether the community's sentiment about a decline in quality due to AI is justified by analyzing data trends.

    The author initially explores potential indicators of AI influence, such as a rise in generic or repetitive comments, a shift in discussion topics, or changes in user engagement patterns. He plans to look for increased use of specific keywords or phrases associated with AI-generated content. The author suggests that if there's a noticeable shift in the nature of discussions and content, it could indicate the growing influence of AI. The analysis involves visualizing data to find anomalies that point to a rise in AI-related or AI-generated content.

    The blog post suggests that while anecdotal observations might suggest a decline in quality due to AI, a data-driven approach is necessary to validate these claims. The author's approach involves collecting and analyzing Hacker News data to identify trends and markers that could indicate an increase in AI-generated or AI-influenced content. The end goal is to assess whether the concerns about AI "taking over" Hacker News are based on factual evidence or merely perception.
