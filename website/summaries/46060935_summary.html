<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>
According to the article on China-in-Space.com, China is developing three reusable rocket programs. The first is a liquid-propellant vertical take-off, vertical landing (VTVL) rocket developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). This rocket is designed for both space tourism and crewed space station missions. A first flight is expected around 2025.

<p>
The second reusable rocket program is being developed by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT), a subsidiary of CASC. The rockets are part of the Long March series and include the Long March 6C, Long March 8R, and Long March 10. This program aims to create a partially reusable rocket, where the first stage returns to the launch site for a vertical landing after separation.

The third program is by Space Transportation, a commercial company that is developing a spaceplane-like rocket which will take off horizontally.
