   The Financial Times article discusses the increasing scrutiny and pressure on the auditing profession, particularly the Big Four firms (Deloitte, EY, KPMG, and PwC), in the wake of several high-profile corporate collapses and accounting scandals. These events have raised serious questions about the quality and independence of audits, leading to calls for reform and stricter regulation.
  </p>
  <p>
   One of the main issues highlighted is the inherent conflict of interest within the audit business model, where audit firms are paid by the very companies they are supposed to be scrutinizing. This creates a potential bias and can compromise the objectivity of the audit. The article also points out that the dominance of the Big Four has reduced competition and choice in the audit market, further weakening the incentives for firms to challenge their clients.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article notes that regulators and governments in various countries are considering measures to address these problems. These include proposals to separate audit and consulting services within the Big Four, introduce joint audits (where two audit firms audit the same company), and create a new, independent regulatory body with more power to oversee the audit industry. Some countries are also exploring ways to increase competition by encouraging smaller audit firms to take on larger clients.

   Furthermore, the article touches upon the impact of technology and data analytics on the audit profession. While technology can potentially improve the efficiency and effectiveness of audits, it also poses new challenges in terms of data security, privacy, and the need for auditors to develop new skills.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article concludes by suggesting that significant reforms are needed to restore public trust in the auditing profession and ensure that audits provide a true and fair view of companies' financial performance. It emphasizes the importance of striking a balance between regulation, competition, and innovation to create a more robust and reliable audit ecosystem. The future of the audit profession depends on its ability to adapt to these changing demands and demonstrate its commitment to integrity and independence.
