The article details allegations that Elon Musk's Boring Company may have had safety issues and that Nevada Governor Joe Lombardo's office potentially intervened to alter documents related to OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) citations and fines against the company.

A Fortune investigation, based on documents and interviews, suggests a pattern of injuries at Boring Company's Nevada facilities. Initially, OSHA issued citations and fines related to these injuries, citing safety violations. However, these citations and fines were later rescinded, raising questions about potential political influence.

<p>
The core of the controversy revolves around allegations that Governor Lombardo's office, influenced by Musk's political donations, pressured the Department of Business and Industry, which oversees OSHA, to be more lenient towards The Boring Company. Internal communications indicate that the governor's office expressed concerns about the potential negative impact of the fines on the company and its projects in the state.

Specifically, the article points to instances where OSHA findings of safety violations were allegedly downplayed or dismissed after intervention from higher-ups within the state government. Some officials express concerns that the usual processes were bypassed and that the company was receiving preferential treatment due to its connection to Elon Musk and his political influence.

The article raises ethical questions about the relationship between political donations, regulatory oversight, and workplace safety. It suggests that the alleged intervention could have compromised the safety of workers at The Boring Company's Nevada sites. The Governor's office denies that there were any altered documents.
