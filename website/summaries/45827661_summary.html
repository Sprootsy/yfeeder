  <p>
    The article is a detailed technical analysis of a newly discovered IBM AT Model BIOS, specifically version 03/20/86, which predates previously known versions. The author meticulously examines the BIOS code, highlighting differences and similarities compared to later revisions. The analysis covers various aspects of the BIOS, including the power-on self-test (POST) routines, interrupt handlers (particularly INT 13h for disk I/O), and support for different hardware components. The author describes how the BIOS initializes the system, detects and configures installed hardware (memory, display adapters, disk drives), and provides basic services for the operating system.

    A significant portion of the article focuses on the floppy disk controller (FDC) routines and how the BIOS handles different drive types and formats. The author identifies several interesting features and peculiarities in the code, such as the handling of error conditions, the techniques used for data transfer, and the BIOS's attempts to optimize disk access. The analysis also delves into the video BIOS extensions and the routines responsible for displaying text and graphics on the screen. The article contains reverse engineering efforts to understand the purpose and functionality of various code segments, including disassembled code snippets and annotations.

    Furthermore, the author explores the BIOS's handling of the real-time clock (RTC) and CMOS memory, as well as the keyboard controller and its interaction with the system. The analysis also touches upon the memory management routines and how the BIOS allocates and manages system memory. The article highlights the evolution of the BIOS code over time, comparing the newly discovered version with later revisions and noting the changes and improvements that were introduced. It sheds light on the engineering decisions and constraints that shaped the design of the original IBM AT BIOS.
