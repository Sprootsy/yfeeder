<p>FutureHome, a smart home company that filed for bankruptcy, has transitioned its smart home hub to a subscription service. This change impacts users who previously purchased the hub with the expectation of ongoing, free service. The company now requires a monthly fee to maintain the functionality of the hub, effectively turning a previously purchased product into a subscription-based one.</p>

<p>Customers are now faced with the decision of paying the subscription fee or losing the smart home functionality they had previously paid for. The move has sparked considerable backlash from users who feel that the company is unfairly changing the terms of service after the initial purchase. Many users relied on the hub for critical features such as security and automation, and the sudden shift to a subscription model disrupts their established smart home ecosystems.</p>

<p>The subscription includes continued access to core features that were previously available without charge. Users who opt out of the subscription will lose access to these features, rendering their hubs significantly less useful. This decision has raised concerns about the long-term viability of smart home devices and the potential for companies to alter service models after a product has been sold. The shift highlights the risks associated with relying on cloud-based services for essential device functionality.</p>

<p>The situation with FutureHome serves as a cautionary tale for consumers investing in smart home technology, underscoring the importance of considering the long-term service models and financial stability of the companies providing these devices. It also brings attention to the legal and ethical considerations of retroactively changing the terms of service for products that have already been purchased, especially when bankruptcy is involved.</p>
