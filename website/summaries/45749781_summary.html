<p>According to an article by 404 Media, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents are using facial recognition technology on the streets to verify people's citizenship. The report details instances where agents have been observed using handheld devices to scan individuals' faces and then using this information to access government databases, including driver's license photos. This activity has raised serious concerns about privacy, surveillance, and potential civil rights violations, particularly because it appears to be happening without clear legal authorization or public knowledge. The technology enables agents to quickly determine someone's identity and immigration status by comparing their facial features against a vast collection of images stored in government databases.</p>

<p>Privacy advocates argue that this type of surveillance is an overreach of government power and can lead to wrongful detentions, deportations, and other negative consequences for individuals who may be incorrectly identified or targeted based on their appearance. There are also concerns about the accuracy of facial recognition technology, which has been shown to be less reliable when identifying people of color, potentially leading to disproportionate targeting of minority communities. The lack of transparency surrounding these practices is another major issue, as the public has little information about how the technology is being used, what safeguards are in place to protect privacy, and what recourse individuals have if they believe they have been unfairly targeted.</p>

<p>The use of facial recognition technology by ICE and CBP in public spaces represents a significant expansion of government surveillance capabilities, with potentially far-reaching implications for civil liberties and individual privacy. It raises questions about the appropriate limits of law enforcement authority and the need for greater oversight and regulation of facial recognition technology to prevent abuse and ensure accountability.</p>
