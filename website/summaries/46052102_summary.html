  <p>This article introduces the "Generative Burrito Test," a thought experiment designed to evaluate the progress and capabilities of generative AI models, particularly in their ability to understand and execute complex, multi-step instructions within a constrained environment. The test draws an analogy to ordering a burrito, a seemingly simple task that requires understanding various options, dependencies, and potential substitutions. The author argues that current generative AI models, while impressive in some areas, still struggle with the nuanced reasoning, common-sense knowledge, and planning abilities needed to successfully navigate such a scenario. The article explores the specific challenges involved in each step of the burrito ordering process, highlighting the types of errors AI models are prone to make. These challenges include understanding user intent, handling constraints, managing dependencies between choices (e.g., selecting fillings that complement each other), dealing with uncertainty (e.g., unavailable ingredients), and following multi-step instructions. The author anticipates future progress in AI and suggests that the Generative Burrito Test can serve as a benchmark to track advancements toward more robust and reliable AI systems capable of handling real-world tasks.</p>

  <h2>Key Points</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Generative Burrito Test:</b> A thought experiment to assess the capabilities of generative AI in understanding and executing complex instructions.</li>
    <li><b>Real-world Complexity:</b> Highlights the gap between current AI capabilities and the common-sense reasoning required for seemingly simple tasks like ordering a burrito.</li>
    <li><b>Understanding User Intent:</b> AI models need to accurately interpret the user's desired outcome and preferences.</li>
    <li><b>Handling Constraints:</b> AI must manage limitations such as budget, ingredient availability, and dietary restrictions.</li>
    <li><b>Managing Dependencies:</b> Requires understanding how different choices affect each other (e.g., matching flavors in a burrito).</li>
    <li><b>Dealing with Uncertainty:</b> AI must be able to adapt to unexpected situations, like an ingredient being unavailable.</li>
    <li><b>Multi-Step Instructions:</b> Success depends on correctly following a sequence of instructions and actions.</li>
