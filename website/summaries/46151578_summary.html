  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>Jeff Geerling's blog post discusses an impending RAM shortage expected to impact the technology market in 2025. The primary driver of this shortage is the shift to DDR5 memory and the increasing complexity of manufacturing High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), which is crucial for AI applications. Major memory manufacturers like Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix are focusing their production capacity on HBM to meet the high demand from the AI sector, leading to reduced production of DDR5 modules. This shift in production priorities is expected to cause a significant increase in RAM prices, potentially affecting consumers and various industries that rely on memory. Geerling suggests that consumers might need to adjust their expectations regarding system upgrades and purchases, as RAM could become a more expensive component. He also notes that while the DDR5 transition has been slow, the AI boom is accelerating the demand for HBM, further exacerbating the supply issues for DDR5. The article also touches on the potential impact on embedded systems and other devices that require RAM, suggesting a broad impact across the electronics industry.</p>
