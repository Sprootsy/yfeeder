    This article discusses the shortcomings and failures of EnzymeML, a machine learning system designed to accelerate scientific research, particularly in enzyme engineering. The author, writing from a future perspective (June 4, 2025), reflects on the overhyped promises and disappointing reality of EnzymeML. The central premise was that by training large language models (LLMs) on scientific literature, EnzymeML could predict enzyme behavior, design new enzymes with desired properties, and revolutionize fields like drug discovery and materials science. However, the article details numerous reasons why EnzymeML failed to live up to these expectations.
  </p>
  <p>
    One key issue was the "curse of scale." While the LLMs behind EnzymeML were massive, the available data on enzyme behavior remained limited and inconsistent. Scientific papers often lack crucial details, use varying experimental protocols, and sometimes contain outright errors. Feeding this flawed data into the models resulted in unreliable predictions. The models excelled at generating plausible-sounding text but struggled to produce accurate, actionable insights for scientists. The inherent complexity of biological systems, with numerous interacting factors influencing enzyme activity, proved too challenging for the models to fully capture.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another problem was the lack of interpretability. EnzymeML was essentially a "black box." Even when it made seemingly useful predictions, researchers had little understanding of why the model arrived at those conclusions. This lack of transparency made it difficult to trust the model's outputs or to learn anything new about the underlying science. It also hindered the ability to debug or improve the model.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article also highlights the issue of bias in the training data. The scientific literature is not a perfectly representative sample of all possible enzymes or experimental conditions. It tends to focus on certain well-studied enzymes and reactions, neglecting others. This bias was amplified by EnzymeML, leading to models that were better at predicting the behavior of already-well-known enzymes than at discovering truly novel ones.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, the over-reliance on EnzymeML had a negative impact on scientific culture. Funding agencies prioritized projects that heavily incorporated the technology, even when other approaches might have been more appropriate. Young researchers were pressured to use EnzymeML, even if they lacked a solid understanding of the underlying principles of enzyme engineering. This led to a decline in traditional experimental skills and critical thinking.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, the article suggests that the hype surrounding EnzymeML crowded out other promising approaches to enzyme engineering, such as more targeted computational methods and improved experimental techniques. The promise of a quick fix through AI led to a neglect of more fundamental research and development.
