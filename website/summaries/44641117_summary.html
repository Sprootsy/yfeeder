  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The provided content is a status page for Let's Encrypt, a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority (CA). It provides real-time information on the operational status of Let's Encrypt's various systems and services. The status page is hosted by Status.io.</p>
  <p>The page displays the overall system status, indicating whether all systems are operational or if there are any ongoing incidents. It breaks down the status of individual components, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>API</strong>: The main API endpoint for requesting and managing certificates.</li>
    <li><strong>OCSP</strong>: The Online Certificate Status Protocol responder, which provides real-time revocation status of certificates.</li>
    <li><strong>Website</strong>: The Let's Encrypt website (letsencrypt.org).</li>
    <li><strong>Documentation</strong>: Access to Let's Encrypt's documentation.</li>
    <li><strong>Boulder</strong>: The ACME CA software that Let's Encrypt uses.</li>
    <li><strong>Revocation Services</strong>: Services related to certificate revocation.</li>
    <li><strong>ACME v2 Production Endpoint</strong>: The production endpoint for the ACME v2 protocol.</li>
    <li><strong>ACME v2 Staging Endpoint</strong>: The staging endpoint for the ACME v2 protocol, used for testing.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each component's status is indicated by a color-coded symbol, typically green for operational, yellow for under maintenance or experiencing performance issues, orange for partial outage, and red for a major outage. The page also includes a history of past incidents, allowing users to review any previous disruptions and their resolutions. Each incident report typically includes a timeline of updates, detailing the issue, the steps taken to resolve it, and the final resolution.</p>
