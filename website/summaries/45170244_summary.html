    The Ramp article "San Francisco Tech Workers and the 996 Schedule" discusses the prevalence and perceptions of the "996" work schedule (9 a.m. to 9 p.m., 6 days a week) among tech workers in San Francisco. It explores the cultural differences in work expectations between the US and China, where the 996 schedule originated and is more common.

    The article begins by defining the 996 work schedule and noting its association with intense work culture and potential burnout. It contrasts the schedule with the more typical 9-to-5 workday in the US and highlights the legal protections and labor standards that aim to prevent overwork in the United States. However, it acknowledges the increasing pressure on tech workers in competitive environments like Silicon Valley, driven by factors such as ambitious deadlines, the desire to impress investors, and the influence of companies with international operations where 996 is more normalized.
