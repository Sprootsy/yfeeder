The analysis also touches upon the historical context of The Art of Fugue, noting its unfinished state and the debates surrounding its intended instrumentation and purpose. Hein explores how Bach manipulates the subject through diminution, where the notes are shortened, and augmentation, where the notes are lengthened.
