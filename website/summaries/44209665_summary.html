<p>This paper, titled "Immigrant Blackness and the Diasporic Imaginary: The Case of Afro-Caribbean Immigrants in Boston," explores the complex identities of Afro-Caribbean immigrants in Boston, Massachusetts. The author, Tanya Katerí Hernández, examines how these immigrants navigate and negotiate their racial and ethnic identities within the context of American society, which is often structured around a Black/White binary. The study focuses on how Afro-Caribbean immigrants perceive and experience "Blackness" in the United States, and how this perception is shaped by their own cultural backgrounds, migration experiences, and encounters with both African Americans and the broader American racial landscape.</p>

<p>The research delves into the ways in which Afro-Caribbean immigrants construct a "diasporic imaginary" that connects them to a shared history and culture while also differentiating them from African Americans. This diasporic identity is not simply a static or essentialized notion of Blackness, but rather a dynamic and fluid construct that is constantly being negotiated and redefined in relation to their experiences in the US. The study explores the tensions and contradictions that arise as Afro-Caribbean immigrants grapple with issues of race, ethnicity, and national identity.</p>

<p>The author employs qualitative research methods, including interviews and ethnographic observations, to gain insights into the lived experiences of Afro-Caribbean immigrants in Boston. The analysis considers factors such as language, cultural practices, social networks, and political affiliations in shaping their identities. The paper also examines the ways in which Afro-Caribbean immigrants engage with and challenge dominant narratives of race and Blackness in the United States.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the study addresses the issue of intra-group diversity among Afro-Caribbean immigrants, recognizing that they come from various islands and nations, each with its own distinct history and culture. The research explores how these differences intersect with their experiences of race and ethnicity in the United States, leading to diverse expressions of identity and belonging.</p>

<p>In essence, the paper contributes to a broader understanding of the complexities of race and ethnicity in the diaspora, highlighting the ways in which immigrant experiences can challenge and reshape existing categories of identity. It sheds light on the nuanced ways in which Afro-Caribbean immigrants negotiate their identities as Black individuals in the United States, while also maintaining connections to their cultural heritage and forging new forms of diasporic belonging.</p>
