    <h2>Build and Host AI-Powered Apps with Claude – No Deployment Needed</h2>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article discusses Anthropic's new capability called "Claude-Powered Artifacts," which allows users to create and collaborate on documents directly within the Claude interface. This moves beyond simple chatbot interactions to a more persistent and collaborative workspace. Users can now instruct Claude to generate documents, and these documents are saved as "Artifacts" within a dedicated section of the Claude application.
  </p>
  <p>
    The key benefit is the creation of a central hub for collaborative work. Several users can view and edit the same Artifact simultaneously. This is designed to facilitate various use cases such as brainstorming, collaborative writing, project planning, and more. Imagine a team simultaneously working on a project proposal generated and refined with Claude’s assistance, or a group brainstorming ideas, with Claude capturing and organizing them into a structured document.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article highlights that Artifacts are designed to be a workspace that persists, allowing users to return to their projects and continue working on them over time. It is a move beyond the ephemeral nature of typical chatbot conversations toward a more sustained and collaborative interaction model. The feature allows users to iteratively refine and build upon Claude's output, creating a dynamic and evolving document.
  </p>
  <p>
    The new feature is being rolled out to Claude Pro users and Claude Team plan users. Anthropic positions this as a step towards a future where AI assistants can actively participate in and enhance collaborative workflows, making AI a more integrated part of the creative and productive process.
