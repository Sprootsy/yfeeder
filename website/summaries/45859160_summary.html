 <h2>Summary:</h2>
 The article discusses a landmark ruling by the European Court of Justice concerning Facebook's targeted advertising practices. The case originated in Germany, where a consumer protection group challenged Facebook's practice of allowing advertisers to target users based on gender, arguing that this violated EU law prohibiting gender-based discrimination in advertising. The court sided with the consumer group, stating that while the EU's data protection laws don't explicitly forbid gender-based advertising, the interpretation of other EU directives related to advertising standards must ensure that such practices don't lead to discriminatory outcomes.
 

 The ruling highlights the complex interplay between data privacy, targeted advertising, and anti-discrimination laws within the EU framework. It underscores the importance of interpreting data protection regulations in conjunction with broader legal principles aimed at preventing discrimination. The court recognized that even when personal data is processed with user consent, as is the case with Facebook's targeted ads, there is still a responsibility to ensure that the resulting advertising practices are not discriminatory. The decision emphasizes that advertising that reinforces gender stereotypes or disadvantages individuals based on their gender is unlawful.
 

 The implications of the ruling could be significant for online advertising platforms operating in Europe. It may necessitate a review of how these platforms allow advertisers to target specific demographic groups, potentially leading to changes in the tools and options available to advertisers. The decision may also encourage regulators to scrutinize targeted advertising practices more closely, potentially leading to greater enforcement of anti-discrimination laws in the digital sphere.
 

 The ruling serves as a reminder that while data-driven advertising can be a powerful tool for businesses, it must be used responsibly and in compliance with relevant legal and ethical standards. The focus is on preventing online advertising that could perpetuate stereotypes or discriminate against certain groups based on protected characteristics.
