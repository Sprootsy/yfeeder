<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The article describes Tufte CSS, a stylesheet designed to provide simple and elegant web typography. It's inspired by the visual design principles of Edward Tufte's books and handouts. Tufte's design philosophy emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and the effective use of visual elements to enhance understanding. Tufte CSS attempts to bring this aesthetic to web pages, focusing on content and readability above all else. It prioritizes serif fonts for body text, small sans-serif fonts for headings, and the liberal use of sidenotes and margin notes to provide context and elaboration without disrupting the main flow of the text. The stylesheet uses a wide left margin for these sidenotes and margin notes, allowing supplementary information to exist alongside the primary content. It uses semantic HTML elements combined with CSS to create a visually appealing and functional layout. Emphasis is placed on keeping the design minimal and unobtrusive, allowing the content to take center stage. Tufte CSS is meant to be a starting point for creating web pages that are both beautiful and easy to read, especially for documents that require detailed explanations and supplementary information.</p>
