  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The provided text is a GitHub repository description for a project named "hazel" by hazelgrove. Based on the repository's description, "hazel" is a command-line tool designed for creating lightweight, self-contained demos of command-line applications. It allows users to record terminal sessions, including both input and output, and then package these recordings along with the application itself into a single executable file. This executable can then be distributed and run on other machines without requiring the user to install the application or any dependencies, as everything is bundled together.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tool appears to be aimed at improving the user experience when demonstrating or sharing command-line applications.  Instead of requiring recipients to install potentially complex dependencies or follow multi-step setup instructions, they can simply run the "hazel"-generated executable and see the application in action. This simplifies the process of showcasing features, providing tutorials, or creating reproducible examples.
  </p>
  <p>
    The self-contained nature of the demos created by "hazel" makes them ideal for distribution in environments where dependency management is difficult or undesirable, such as workshops, online tutorials, or bug reports.  The repository likely contains the source code for the "hazel" tool, along with instructions on how to use it to create these self-contained demos. The core functionality revolves around capturing terminal interactions and bundling them with the target application into a distributable package.
