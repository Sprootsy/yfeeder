  <p>The Associated Press article discusses allegations of abuse and mistreatment of Palestinian prisoners by Israeli forces following the October 7 Hamas attack. The report details claims from detainees, human rights organizations, and lawyers about severe beatings, denial of medical care, overcrowding, and degrading treatment in Israeli detention facilities. Some prisoners have reportedly died in custody, raising serious concerns about accountability and oversight.

The article highlights the challenges in verifying claims due to restricted access to detention centers and a lack of transparency. It also examines the broader context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the long-standing concerns about human rights violations in the treatment of Palestinian prisoners.</p>
