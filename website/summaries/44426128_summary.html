  <p>The article discusses a lawsuit filed by Proton, the company behind ProtonMail, against Apple. Proton alleges that Apple is using its market power to stifle competition and extract excessive fees from developers. The core of the dispute revolves around Apple's App Store policies, specifically the requirement that developers use Apple's in-app purchase system, which levies a 30% commission on digital goods and services.</p>

  <p>Proton claims that Apple initially rejected its updated ProtonMail app because it included a feature allowing users to upgrade to a paid subscription plan. Apple argued that this violated its App Store guidelines, as Proton was not using Apple's in-app purchase system for these upgrades. Proton contends that it couldn't reasonably comply with this requirement because the subscriptions were also available on Proton's website and other platforms. Forcing users to purchase through the App Store would mean Apple taking a 30% cut of revenue that Proton would otherwise receive in full.</p>

  <p>The article highlights Proton's belief that Apple's policies are designed to protect its own services and generate substantial revenue at the expense of smaller developers. It notes that this issue is not unique to Proton, as many other companies have voiced similar concerns about Apple's App Store practices. The lawsuit argues that Apple's control over the iOS ecosystem gives it the power to dictate terms that are anti-competitive and harmful to innovation.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the article mentions that Proton eventually relented and removed the upgrade feature from its iOS app to comply with Apple's demands. This, according to Proton, demonstrates the extent of Apple's influence and the difficulties faced by developers who rely on the App Store to reach their users.</p>

  <p>The lawsuit seeks to challenge Apple's App Store policies and create a fairer environment for developers. Proton believes that Apple should not be allowed to use its market dominance to impose unfair terms and restrict competition. The outcome of this case could have significant implications for the future of the App Store and the broader mobile app ecosystem.</p>
