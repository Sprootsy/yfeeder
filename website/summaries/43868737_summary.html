    <h2>A Common Lisp jq replacement</h2>
    <div>
 <div>
  <p>This blog post introduces `cl-jq`, a Common Lisp library created as a replacement for the popular command-line JSON processor, `jq`. The author details the motivations behind creating `cl-jq`, which include the desire for a more customizable and extensible JSON processing tool within the Common Lisp ecosystem, and also being able to easily use it with other Lisp libraries and systems.</p>
  <p>The post highlights `cl-jq`'s core functionalities such as reading, parsing, and manipulating JSON data. It showcases how `cl-jq` can perform operations similar to `jq`, like filtering, mapping, and transforming JSON structures. The library is presented as a way to programmatically interact with JSON data within Lisp, thus offering advantages over shell-based `jq` usage, especially when integrating with larger applications or when complex logic is needed.</p>
  <p>The author provides code examples demonstrating how to use `cl-jq` to perform various tasks. These examples show how to load JSON data, extract specific values, iterate through arrays, and perform more complex transformations. The post emphasizes the flexibility that `cl-jq` offers by leveraging the full power of Common Lisp, potentially making it more suitable for advanced JSON processing scenarios compared to `jq` alone.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the blog entry discusses potential future improvements and extensions to `cl-jq`. The author outlines plans for expanding its feature set, optimizing performance, and improving its integration with other Common Lisp libraries. It serves as both an announcement of the library's initial release and a call for contributions and feedback from the Common Lisp community.</p>
  <p>In essence, the post communicates the availability of a new Common Lisp tool for JSON processing, designed to offer more flexibility and integration capabilities than traditional command-line tools like `jq`, particularly within the context of Lisp-based applications.</p>
