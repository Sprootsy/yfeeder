  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The article discusses the increasing use of anti-cheat software in video games and the technologies they employ, specifically Secure Boot and Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs). It explains how anti-cheat systems have evolved from simple methods to kernel-level drivers that operate with high privileges to detect cheating. The author highlights the privacy and security implications of kernel-level anti-cheat, as these systems have deep access to a user's computer and can potentially be exploited. Secure Boot and TPMs are hardware-based security features that can be used by anti-cheat software to verify the integrity of the operating system and game files. Secure Boot ensures that only trusted operating systems and software can boot on a system, while TPMs provide a secure way to store cryptographic keys and perform cryptographic operations. The article explores how these technologies can be used to create a more secure gaming environment by preventing cheaters from modifying game files or using unauthorized software. However, it also raises concerns about the potential for these technologies to be used to restrict user freedom and control over their own computers. The author emphasizes the importance of transparency and user choice when it comes to anti-cheat software and the use of hardware-based security features.</p>
