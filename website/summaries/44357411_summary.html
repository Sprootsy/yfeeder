  <p>
    uv is an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver, written in Rust. It is designed as a drop-in replacement for `pip` and `pip-tools`, with the goal of being significantly faster. uv aims to be a comprehensive tool in the Python packaging ecosystem, eventually encompassing package installation, resolution, virtual environment management, and more.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project is developed by Astral, the same team behind Ruff.  uv leverages Rust for performance and safety. Its initial focus is on dramatically improving the speed of Python package installation and dependency resolution.  It strives for compatibility with existing Python packaging standards and workflows, acting as a direct substitute for familiar tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, uv supports installing packages from PyPI, resolving dependencies, creating and managing virtual environments, and reading `requirements.txt` files.  It offers a command-line interface (CLI) similar to `pip` for ease of use. Benchmarks provided by the uv team demonstrate substantial speed improvements compared to `pip` and `pip-tools`, particularly in scenarios involving complex dependency graphs or large numbers of packages. For example, installing PyTorch with its dependencies is significantly faster with uv.
  </p>
  <p>
    While uv is still under active development, it's already usable for many common Python packaging tasks.  Future plans include expanding its feature set to fully replace tools like `pip`, `pip-tools`, and potentially even virtualenv or venv for virtual environment management. The project's roadmap involves adding support for more advanced features and edge cases, further solidifying its position as a high-performance alternative in the Python packaging landscape.
