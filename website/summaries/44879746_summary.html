  <p>The Newsweek article discusses recent changes to the H-1B visa program approved by the White House, as outlined in a report. The H-1B visa program allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. These occupations generally require a bachelor's degree or its equivalent. The H-1B visa is often used by companies in the tech industry to hire skilled workers from countries like India and China.</p>

  <p>The approved changes aim to reform and strengthen the H-1B visa program to better protect American workers and ensure that the program benefits the U.S. economy. One key aspect of the reform involves stricter enforcement and oversight to prevent fraud and abuse. The goal is to ensure that H-1B visas are awarded to truly qualified individuals and that employers are not using the program to displace American workers or drive down wages.</p>

  <p>Another focus of the changes is to prioritize the selection of H-1B visa applicants based on skill and wage level. The intention is to favor higher-skilled workers and those who would be paid higher wages, which would help to prevent companies from using the program to hire cheaper labor. This shift is intended to ensure that the H-1B program complements the U.S. workforce rather than substitutes it.</p>

  <p>The report also highlights efforts to increase transparency and accountability in the H-1B visa process. This includes providing more information to the public about the program's operation and outcomes, as well as enhancing the ability of government agencies to monitor and investigate potential violations. By improving transparency, the changes seek to build trust in the program and ensure that it is serving its intended purpose.</p>

  <p>These reforms are part of a broader effort to modernize the U.S. immigration system and align it with the country's economic needs. The goal is to attract and retain talented foreign workers who can contribute to innovation and economic growth, while also protecting the interests of American workers and ensuring fair competition in the labor market.</p>
