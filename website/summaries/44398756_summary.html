<p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has captured its first direct image of an exoplanet, a planet orbiting a star outside our solar system. This achievement marks a significant milestone for the telescope and for exoplanet research. The exoplanet, known as HIP 65426 b, is a gas giant located relatively far from its host star, HIP 65426, making it easier to observe directly. It is estimated to be six to twelve times the mass of Jupiter and is thought to be a relatively young planet, formed approximately 15 to 20 million years ago. The image was obtained using JWST's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), each capturing the exoplanet in different wavelengths of infrared light.</p>

<p>Direct imaging of exoplanets is challenging due to the overwhelming brightness of their host stars. JWST's advanced technology, including coronagraphs that block out the starlight, allows scientists to overcome this hurdle and directly observe these distant worlds. The new images of HIP 65426 b showcase JWST's ability to study exoplanets in unprecedented detail, providing valuable insights into their composition, temperature, and formation. Previous observations of HIP 65426 b were made using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile, but JWST's observations provide a much clearer and more detailed view.</p>

<p>The image of HIP 65426 b shows up differently in each of the four filters used to capture the images. This is due to the different wavelengths of light, which in turn helps scientists understand the planet's composition. In the shorter wavelengths, the planet is less bright than in the longer wavelengths.</p>

<p>This discovery demonstrates JWST's potential to revolutionize exoplanet research. Direct imaging allows scientists to study the atmospheres of exoplanets, search for signs of water or other molecules of interest, and potentially even identify planets that may be habitable. As JWST continues its mission, it is expected to provide a wealth of new information about exoplanets and our place in the universe.</p>
