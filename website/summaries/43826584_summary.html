  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
   The article discusses the evolving landscape of AI, particularly focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs) and their increasing capabilities. It highlights the shift from simply prompting these models to a more complex interaction involving agents and tools. These AI agents can now perform tasks autonomously, leveraging tools to achieve specific goals. The piece emphasizes the importance of prompt engineering in this new era, as it becomes crucial for guiding these agents effectively.
