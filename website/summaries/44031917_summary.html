<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The article from TheWrap discusses recent controversies surrounding Scott Adams, the creator of the comic strip "Dilbert," and their impact on his career. It details how Adams made racially charged remarks on a YouTube livestream, prompting numerous newspapers to drop "Dilbert." The controversy began when Adams cited a Rasmussen Reports poll indicating that a significant percentage of Black Americans did not agree with the statement "Itâ€™s OK to be white." Adams interpreted this as evidence that Black people are a "hate group" and advised white people to "get the hell away from Black people."</p>
<p>These remarks quickly generated widespread condemnation. Media outlets, including major newspaper chains like Gannett, the Los Angeles Times, and The Washington Post, announced they would no longer publish "Dilbert." Andrews McMeel Universal, which syndicates "Dilbert," also cut ties with Adams.</p>
<p>The article also touches on Adams' past history of controversial statements and his increasing alignment with right-wing political views. It mentions his previous claims about being blacklisted and his tendency to make provocative statements on various social issues.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the article briefly mentions Adams' disclosure of his prostate cancer diagnosis. It acknowledges that Adams announced he was undergoing treatment for prostate cancer but notes that this revelation has been overshadowed by the backlash from his racist comments. The article also points out that Adams has frequently made remarks critical of President Biden and other political figures, reflecting his increasingly polarized stance.</p>
<p>In short, the article focuses on the fallout from Adams' racially charged comments, the subsequent cancellation of "Dilbert" by numerous media outlets, and the broader context of Adams' history of controversial statements and political views.</p>
