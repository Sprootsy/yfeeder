<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The article discusses how leaders in India, Hungary, and the U.S. are employing nostalgia and nationalism to undermine higher education. These leaders leverage idealized versions of the past and strong nationalistic sentiments to consolidate power, often by attacking universities and academic freedom.
</p>
<p>
In India, the government promotes a Hindu-nationalist agenda, seeking to rewrite history and emphasize ancient Hindu achievements while marginalizing minority perspectives and critical scholarship. This agenda has led to changes in curricula and the appointment of ideologically aligned academics to key positions, threatening the secular and pluralistic nature of Indian higher education.
</p>
<p>
In Hungary, Viktor Orbán's government has similarly used nationalist rhetoric to exert control over universities. By promoting a specific version of Hungarian history and culture, Orbán's administration has restricted academic freedom and forced the closure or relocation of institutions like the Central European University, which were seen as promoting liberal values and foreign influence.
</p>
<p>
In the U.S., conservative politicians and commentators have increasingly attacked universities for allegedly promoting liberal indoctrination and anti-American values. Figures like Donald Trump have questioned the value of higher education and stoked cultural grievances, leading to funding cuts and restrictions on academic research and teaching.
</p>
<p>
The article argues that these attacks on higher education are part of a broader trend of authoritarianism, where leaders manipulate historical narratives and national identity to suppress dissent and maintain power. By undermining universities, these leaders aim to control the production and dissemination of knowledge, ensuring that it aligns with their political agendas. The consequences of these actions include a decline in academic freedom, a narrowing of intellectual inquiry, and a weakening of democratic institutions. The article emphasizes the importance of defending academic freedom and critical thinking in the face of these challenges.
