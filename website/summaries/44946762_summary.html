   The article discusses how Croatian freediver Budimir Šobat, nicknamed "Buda," set a Guinness World Record for the longest time breath-held voluntarily underwater by a male, with a time of 24 minutes and 37 seconds, surpassing his previous record. However, in May 2024, he extended his own world record by holding his breath for 29 minutes and 24 seconds. This incredible feat took place in a controlled environment – a swimming pool in Sisak, Croatia. The achievement was not just a personal one for Šobat, but also served as a fundraiser and awareness campaign for children with disabilities and autism through his foundation.

   Šobat's journey to this record was not without significant challenges. He began preparing for the record attempt several years prior, dedicating himself to rigorous training and mental conditioning. The article emphasizes the extreme physiological demands of static apnea, which involves voluntarily suspending breathing for an extended period. Before the actual breath-hold, Šobat underwent hyperventilation with pure oxygen to maximize oxygen saturation in his body, a common practice in competitive freediving.

   The article highlights the critical risks associated with prolonged breath-holding, including the risk of hypoxia (oxygen deprivation), loss of consciousness, and even death. The entire process was meticulously monitored by a team of medical professionals and experienced freediving experts to ensure Šobat's safety. The Guinness World Records guidelines were strictly adhered to, and the attempt was officially recognized and validated.

   Beyond the physical and technical aspects, the article underscores the profound mental fortitude required for such an endeavor. Šobat's success was attributed to his ability to control his heart rate, manage the urge to breathe, and maintain a state of deep relaxation. He focused on mental exercises and visualization techniques to remain calm and composed throughout the ordeal. His support team played a crucial role in providing encouragement and ensuring a safe and supportive environment.

   The article concludes by recognizing Šobat's dedication, perseverance, and the inspiring nature of his achievement. It highlights his commitment to using his accomplishments to benefit others, particularly children with disabilities, thus adding a philanthropic dimension to his world record. His story serves as an example of human potential and the ability to overcome extraordinary physical and mental challenges through rigorous preparation and unwavering determination.
