  <h3>Summary:</h3>
  <p>
  According to an Axios report, private equity firm Bending Spoons is close to acquiring Yahoo, which includes brands like TechCrunch and Engadget, from Apollo Global Management. The potential deal, which could finalize in the coming days, would value Yahoo at under $8 billion. This is lower than the $5 billion Apollo paid for it in 2021. The agreement between Apollo and Bending Spoons involves a complicated financial arrangement where Apollo would provide financing for the acquisition, keeping some exposure to Yahoo's potential future performance. Bending Spoons intends to use its technology to improve Yahoo's content and advertising. The deal is happening after a period of layoffs and cost-cutting measures at Yahoo under Apollo's control.
