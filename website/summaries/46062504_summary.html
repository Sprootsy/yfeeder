  <h3>Summary:</h3>
  <p>
    The article discusses the impact of the European Union's (EU) regulations on Apple's adoption of new Wi-Fi standards and the subsequent implications for Android devices, particularly regarding Airdrop-like functionality. Due to EU pressure concerning interoperability, Apple has been compelled to support the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), specifically Wi-Fi Direct, in its devices. Wi-Fi Direct enables devices to connect directly to each other without needing a central wireless network.

  <p>
    This change allows Android devices to implement a feature similar to Apple's AirDrop, facilitating seamless file sharing between different operating systems. The absence of a universal standard for quick, direct file transfers has been a long-standing issue, with AirDrop being exclusive to Apple devices and Android relying on manufacturer-specific or third-party solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The EU's intervention levels the playing field and fosters greater competition in the consumer electronics market. The move towards universal standards will benefit consumers by providing them with more choices and flexibility in their device usage.
