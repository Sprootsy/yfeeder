    <h2>Core Devices keeps stealing our work</h2>

  <p>The article is a fictional blog post from the future (November 17, 2025) written by someone from Rebble, a community that kept Pebble smartwatches alive after the company shut down. The post accuses Core Devices, a fictional tech company that acquired Fitbit, of repeatedly taking ideas and code from the Rebble community and incorporating them into their products without attribution or compensation.

  <p>
   The author begins by mentioning previous instances where Core Devices allegedly copied Rebble's work, such as improvements to sleep tracking and a timeline-based interface. They acknowledge that these were difficult to prove definitively, but the author had strong suspicions based on similarities and the timing of the features' appearance in Core Devices' products.

  <p>
   The latest incident, however, is presented as being much more blatant. Rebble had been working on a feature called "Quick Actions" which allowed users to quickly perform tasks with their smartwatches with a streamlined UI. The author presents side-by-side comparisons of Rebble's Quick Actions interface and Core Devices' newly released "Core Actions" feature, highlighting near-identical design elements and functionality. The author expresses frustration and anger at what they see as a clear case of plagiarism and accuses Core Devices of exploiting the open-source nature of Rebble's work for their own profit.

   The author emphasizes that Rebble is a small, volunteer-driven community, and that Core Devices is a large corporation with vastly more resources. They argue that Core Devices is taking advantage of this power imbalance by taking code and ideas from Rebble without giving back to the community. They also express concern that this behavior discourages innovation and open-source contributions, as it creates a situation where large companies can simply copy the work of smaller communities without consequence.

   The author details the difficulty of proving intellectual property theft, especially when code has been rewritten, but the design and functional similarities between Rebble's and Core Devices' features are too obvious to ignore. The author states that while Rebble cannot afford expensive legal battles, they are calling on the community to raise awareness of Core Devices' actions and to put pressure on the company to acknowledge Rebble's contributions and compensate them fairly.
  </p>

   The article concludes with a plea for support and a call for greater ethical responsibility within the tech industry, particularly from large corporations that benefit from open-source communities.
