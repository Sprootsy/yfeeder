  <p>Summary:</p>
  <p>The article "Knowledge-Based Society, My Ass" by Mihai Olteanu critiques the prevalent idea of a "knowledge-based society." Olteanu argues that while knowledge is theoretically valued, the reality is that many individuals are trapped in jobs that require little to no intellectual stimulation, performing repetitive tasks that could easily be automated. He points out the discrepancy between the rhetoric of a society that rewards knowledge workers and the actual distribution of labor, where a significant portion of the workforce is engaged in manual or service-oriented jobs. Olteanu suggests that the "knowledge-based society" narrative is often a top-down construct pushed by elites to justify existing power structures and maintain control, while masking the exploitation of labor. He also touches upon the education system, implying that it might be geared more toward producing compliant workers than fostering genuine knowledge and critical thinking. The author expresses skepticism about the feasibility of everyone becoming a knowledge worker in the current economic system, highlighting the need for more realistic and equitable approaches to work and education.</p>
