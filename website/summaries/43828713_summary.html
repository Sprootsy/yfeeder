    The article is a critical and sarcastic commentary on the notion of a "knowledge-based society." The author argues that despite the widespread use of the term, society is far from truly valuing or operating based on knowledge. He contends that various factors, including the prioritization of appearances, social connections, and conformity over genuine expertise, hinder the development of such a society. He criticizes the education system for focusing on rote memorization and standardized testing rather than fostering critical thinking and creativity. The author also points out the prevalence of misinformation, "fake news," and the tendency to dismiss experts in favor of popular opinion or emotionally driven narratives.

    The author goes on to suggest that the pursuit of knowledge is often undermined by economic incentives that favor short-term gains and the exploitation of intellectual property rather than the open sharing and advancement of knowledge. He further argues that the hierarchical structures of many organizations stifle innovation and discourage dissenting opinions, making it difficult for true knowledge and expertise to be effectively utilized. He notes that while access to information has increased exponentially, the ability to filter and critically evaluate that information has not kept pace, leading to information overload and a susceptibility to manipulation. He believes that social media, with its echo chambers and algorithmic biases, contributes to the polarization of opinions and further undermines the possibility of a knowledge-based society.

    The author satirically portrays the idea that simply having access to information or possessing a degree equates to being knowledgeable or contributing to a knowledge-based society. He expresses disillusionment with the current state of affairs, where superficial metrics often outweigh genuine understanding and where the pursuit of knowledge is often viewed as impractical or even detrimental to career advancement. The tone is cynical and provocative, intended to challenge the reader's assumptions about the value and role of knowledge in contemporary society. He concludes by implying that the "knowledge-based society" is more of a marketing buzzword than a reality, serving to mask the underlying problems and contradictions of modern society.
