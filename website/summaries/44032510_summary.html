    <h2>So why *did* U.S. wages stagnate for 20 years?</h2>

  <p>The article "So Why Did US Wages Stagnate For So Long?" by Noah Smith discusses the reasons behind the stagnation of US wages, particularly for male workers, from the 1970s to the mid-2010s. Smith argues that the conventional explanation of a slowdown in productivity growth isn't sufficient, as productivity continued to increase, albeit at a slower pace, while wages for many did not. The article delves into various contributing factors, dismissing some common assumptions and highlighting more nuanced explanations.</p>
  
  <p>Smith begins by stating that focusing solely on the aggregate productivity slowdown is misleading. He points out that productivity did not stop growing, but the benefits of that growth were not evenly distributed. He then tackles the idea that a shift from manufacturing to services is to blame. Smith counters that while manufacturing jobs declined, the service sector includes many high-paying jobs, and the issue is more about the types of service jobs that grew and the distribution of income within the service sector.</p>
  
  <p>The decline of unions is mentioned as a potential factor. Smith acknowledges that union membership decreased significantly during the period, weakening workers' bargaining power. He suggests this could have contributed to wage stagnation, especially for blue-collar workers. However, he notes this doesn't fully explain the entire phenomenon.</p>
  
  <p>The article also addresses the impact of globalization and trade. While imports from low-wage countries may have put downward pressure on wages in some sectors, Smith suggests that the overall effect of trade on wage stagnation is probably less substantial than often believed. He cites research suggesting that the impact of trade on manufacturing job losses, and therefore wage stagnation, might be overstated.</p>
  
  <p>Technological change and automation are presented as a more significant driver. Smith argues that technological advancements have disproportionately benefited highly skilled workers while potentially displacing or devaluing the work of lower-skilled and middle-skilled workers. This has created a "skills-biased technological change," where the demand for cognitive and non-routine skills has increased, leaving many behind.</p>

  <p>Smith emphasizes the role of increased market power among firms. He argues that as industries have become more concentrated, companies have gained more power to suppress wages and capture a larger share of the economic pie. This reduced competition in labor markets could explain why productivity gains didn't translate into higher wages for many workers.</p>

  <p>The article notes that CEO compensation skyrocketed during the stagnation period. Smith suggests that this increase in executive pay, along with higher profits for corporations, came at the expense of worker wages, further widening the income gap.</p>
  
  <p>Finally, Smith mentions the decline in real minimum wage. While not a primary driver of overall wage stagnation, the decline in the inflation-adjusted minimum wage affected a significant segment of the workforce, especially those at the lower end of the wage distribution.</p>
  
  <p>In conclusion, Smith argues that US wage stagnation was a complex issue with multiple contributing factors, including the decline of unions, technological change, increased market power of firms, rising CEO compensation, and the declining real minimum wage. He suggests that while productivity did grow, its benefits were not shared equitably due to these factors, leading to wage stagnation for many American workers.</p>

   <li>The decline of unions weakened workers' bargaining power, contributing to wage stagnation, especially for blue-collar workers.</li>
   <li>Globalization and trade may have played a role, but their impact on wage stagnation is likely less substantial than often believed.</li>
   <li>Technological change and automation disproportionately benefited highly skilled workers, leading to "skills-biased technological change".</li>
   <li>Increased market power among firms allowed companies to suppress wages and capture a larger share of economic gains.</li>
   <li>Rising CEO compensation and corporate profits came at the expense of worker wages, widening the income gap.</li>
   <li>The decline in the real minimum wage affected a significant segment of the low-wage workforce.</li>
   <li>Wage stagnation was a multifaceted problem with no single cause, but rather a confluence of factors that resulted in unequal distribution of economic gains.</li>
