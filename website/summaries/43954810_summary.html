    <strong>Summary:</strong>
    During Donald Trump's presidency, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established the Community Change Grants program. One notable aspect of this program involved funding initiatives aimed at reducing food waste. Despite the Trump administration's broader deregulatory agenda, this particular effort aligned with bipartisan support for addressing food waste, recognizing its environmental and economic consequences. The grants supported various community-based projects focused on preventing food from going to landfills, promoting food recovery, and raising public awareness about the issue. These projects often involved partnerships between local governments, non-profit organizations, and businesses. By investing in such initiatives, the EPA aimed to foster innovative solutions and create replicable models for reducing food waste at the local level, contributing to broader sustainability goals.
