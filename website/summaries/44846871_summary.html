    <h2>MCP overlooks hard-won lessons from distributed systems</h2>

   <p>This article by Jul Simon discusses the potential pitfalls of Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) disregarding well-established Remote Procedure Call (RPC) best practices. The author argues that MCPS's approach, which isn't clearly defined in the article but is implied to be unconventional, carries significant risks for enterprise-level systems.</p>
 

   <p>The central theme revolves around the importance of adhering to proven methodologies in distributed computing, particularly concerning RPC. The article suggests that a departure from these established norms can lead to a host of problems. While the specific RPC implementation or architecture used by MCPS isn't detailed, the author warns against the dangers of ignoring decades of accumulated knowledge in the field.</p>
 

   <p>The author highlights potential consequences such as increased system complexity, reduced maintainability, and heightened vulnerability to errors. He emphasizes that RPC is a mature technology with widely recognized patterns and standards, and that deviating from these without a compelling reason is generally ill-advised. A lack of adherence to these best practices can result in systems that are difficult to understand, debug, and scale.</p>
 

   <p>Furthermore, the article suggests that MCPS's approach could lead to integration challenges with other systems and services. Interoperability is a key concern in modern enterprise environments, and non-standard RPC implementations can create barriers to seamless communication between different components. This can result in increased development costs and longer project timelines.</p>
 

   <p>In essence, the author is cautioning against reinventing the wheel and advocating for the adoption of industry-standard RPC practices. He argues that while innovation is important, it should be approached with caution in the context of fundamental technologies like RPC, where established patterns have proven their value over time. Failure to heed this warning, the author suggests, could result in significant operational and financial consequences for MCPS.</p>
