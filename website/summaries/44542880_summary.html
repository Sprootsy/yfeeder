  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>The article "Vibe Coding: A PCB Surprisingly Good" discusses the author's experience designing and building a custom PCB (Printed Circuit Board) for a unique keyboard project. The author, initially intimidated by PCB design, details their journey of learning KiCad, a free and open-source EDA (Electronic Design Automation) software suite. They emphasize the importance of breaking down the project into manageable chunks and thoroughly understanding each component's function and data sheet. The author explores various aspects of PCB design, including schematic creation, component selection, footprint assignment, and routing. They highlight the challenges faced, such as managing ground loops, minimizing noise, and ensuring proper signal integrity. The author describes the iterative process of design, review, and revision, underscoring the value of seeking feedback from experienced PCB designers. They also delve into the manufacturing process, from generating Gerber files to selecting a PCB manufacturer. The author is thrilled with the final product, a functional and aesthetically pleasing PCB. The board features a specific microcontroller, the RP2040, and supports advanced features such as per-key RGB lighting and USB-C connectivity. The author also shares tips for troubleshooting common PCB assembly issues, such as soldering fine-pitch components. The board's unusual shape is explained as being driven by ergonomic considerations and aesthetic appeal. The PCB integrates seamlessly with the keyboard's custom-designed case and keycaps. The author concludes by expressing satisfaction with the project's outcome and encouraging others to embark on their own PCB design journeys.</p>
