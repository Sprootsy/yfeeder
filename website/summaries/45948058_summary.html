    <h2>I have recordings proving Coinbase knew about breach months before disclosure</h2>

  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The article is a detailed timeline and analysis of a security breach experienced by Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, in early 2024. It meticulously reconstructs the events, starting from the initial phishing attack that compromised an employee's credentials to the eventual detection and containment of the breach. The attacker(s) successfully gained access to internal systems and exfiltrated sensitive data, including employee PII and customer information.</p>

  <p>The timeline begins with the initial compromise: an employee falling victim to a sophisticated phishing campaign. This provided the attacker with access to Coinbase's internal network. The attacker then performed reconnaissance, moving laterally through the network, escalating privileges, and identifying valuable data stores. The author highlights the attacker's careful and methodical approach, indicating a high level of skill and planning.</p>

  <p>The breach involved the exploitation of several vulnerabilities, including weak multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementations, inadequate internal segmentation, and insufficient monitoring and alerting. The attacker bypassed MFA using a "man-in-the-middle" (MITM) attack, intercepting and replaying authentication tokens. The lack of robust segmentation allowed the attacker to move freely within the network once the initial foothold was established. Delayed detection also contributed to the severity of the incident, allowing the attacker to remain undetected for a prolonged period.</p>

  <p>Once inside, the attacker targeted specific databases and systems containing sensitive data. This included employee personal identifiable information (PII), customer data, and potentially other confidential information related to Coinbase's operations. The author emphasizes the importance of data encryption and access controls in mitigating the impact of such breaches. Even though the attacker gained access, strong encryption could have rendered the stolen data unusable.</p>

  <p>The article then covers the detection and response phase, describing how Coinbase's security team eventually identified the anomalous activity and initiated incident response procedures. This included isolating affected systems, conducting forensic analysis, and implementing containment measures to prevent further data exfiltration. The author likely praises Coinbase for their transparency in disclosing the breach and for their efforts to notify affected individuals and improve their security posture.</p>

  <p>The author uses the Coinbase breach as a case study to illustrate common attack vectors and vulnerabilities in modern organizations. The article underscores the importance of robust security practices, including strong MFA, network segmentation, continuous monitoring, and effective incident response plans. It serves as a cautionary tale for other companies, urging them to proactively assess their security posture and address potential weaknesses before they can be exploited by attackers.</p>

  <p>Finally, the article concludes with recommendations for improving security, focusing on areas such as employee training, security awareness programs, and the implementation of advanced threat detection and prevention technologies. It emphasizes the need for a layered security approach, where multiple security controls are in place to protect against different types of attacks.</p>
