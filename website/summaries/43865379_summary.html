    <h2>Chrome Origin Trial: Device Bound Session Credentials</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article discusses the Deprecation of third-party cookies and introduces the Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC) origin trial. As third-party cookies are phased out, websites need alternative solutions for various use cases, including fraud prevention. DBSC is proposed as a new Privacy Sandbox API to address fraud prevention specifically. DBSC allows websites to cryptographically bind a user session to a specific device, which helps in detecting and preventing fraudulent activities like bot-driven attacks or account takeovers. The origin trial enables developers to test and evaluate the DBSC API in real-world scenarios and provide feedback to improve its design and functionality. The article provides information on how DBSC works, the use cases it supports, how to participate in the origin trial, and resources for developers to learn more about the API. The goal is to gather data and insights to refine DBSC and ensure it effectively addresses fraud prevention needs while respecting user privacy in a cookieless web environment.
