<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>On May 29, 2024, at 13:14 UTC, solar active region 3697 produced a significant M8.2 (R2 - Moderate) solar flare. This flare was associated with a Type II radio emission with an estimated speed of 1477 km/s and a Type IV radio emission, both indicative of a coronal mass ejection (CME). The CME is anticipated to reach Earth, prompting NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) to issue a G4 (Severe) geomagnetic storm watch for June 1-2, 2024. This geomagnetic storm could potentially affect satellite operations, power grids, and radio communications. The article details the event's timeline, characteristics, and expected impacts, emphasizing the importance of monitoring space weather conditions.</p>
