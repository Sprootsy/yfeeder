    <h2>An embarrassing failure of the US patent system: Nintendo&#39;s latest patents</h2>

   According to a video game IP lawyer, Nintendo's recent patents regarding certain Pokémon mechanics represent a failure of the U.S. patent system. The lawyer argues that these patents, specifically related to aspects like Pokémon evolution and trading, should not have been granted. The core of the argument is that the patented mechanics were either already obvious or previously implemented in other games, and therefore lack the novelty required for patent protection. This raises concerns about the patent office's examination process and the potential for stifling innovation within the gaming industry by allowing companies to patent well-known or commonly used concepts.
