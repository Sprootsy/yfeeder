  <h3>Summary:</h3>
  <p>
    The U.S. Census Bureau projects that by 2030, older adults will outnumber children for the first time in U.S. history. This demographic shift is driven by several factors, including the aging of the Baby Boom generation, increased life expectancy, and declining birth rates. The report highlights that all Baby Boomers will be age 65 and older by 2030, contributing significantly to the growth of the older adult population.

    The Census Bureau uses various demographic measures to understand these population changes, including population size, age, sex, race, and ethnicity. These measures are crucial for policymakers, researchers, and businesses in planning and decision-making. As the population ages, there will be implications for healthcare, social security, housing, and the labor force. Understanding these demographic trends helps in preparing for the future needs of an aging society.
