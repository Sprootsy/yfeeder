  <p>The article discusses how the iconic shark design from the movie "Jaws" may have inadvertently entered the public domain due to a series of copyright-related issues and oversights. The author, Ironic Sans, delves into the complexities of copyright law as it pertains to derivative works, specifically focusing on the differences between the "Jaws" book cover shark and the mechanical shark (Bruce) created for the film.</p>

  <p>The article starts by explaining that while the "Jaws" novel by Peter Benchley is still under copyright, the image of the shark on the book cover, designed by Roger Kastel, is arguably in the public domain. The key point is that Kastel's painting was based on a 1974 Bantam Books cover, which itself was based on a promotional illustration for the 1967 novel "The Shark Hunter" by Ben Cropp. Because the Bantam Books cover was created without proper permission from Cropp, it can be argued that it was an infringing work. Consequently, Kastel's painting, being a derivative of an infringing work, may also lack copyright protection.</p>

  <p>The author then examines the copyright status of the mechanical shark, nicknamed "Bruce," used in the "Jaws" movie. The article highlights that while the film itself is protected by copyright, the design of the shark prop could potentially be considered separate. The author looks at the argument that because the shark's design was not registered with the US Copyright Office as a sculpture, it may not be protected. Furthermore, if the shark's design is substantially similar to a real-life great white shark, it could be argued that it lacks originality and is therefore uncopyrightable.</p>

  <p>The article further explores the concept of "scènes à faire," which refers to elements that are standard or necessary to a particular genre and therefore cannot be copyrighted. The author suggests that the general appearance of a great white shark might fall under this category, making it difficult to claim copyright over a shark design that closely resembles a real shark.</p>

  <p>The author also mentions the visual similarities between Bruce and a real great white shark photographed by Ron Taylor, implying that the film's shark design drew inspiration from existing sources, further weakening any potential copyright claim. The article concludes that while there are complexities and uncertainties, the "Jaws" shark design might indeed be in the public domain, allowing anyone to use it without fear of copyright infringement. The author presents a well-reasoned argument based on copyright law principles and the specific circumstances surrounding the creation of the shark imagery for "Jaws," suggesting that the iconic shark might be freer than many realize.</p>

    <li>The mechanical shark ("Bruce") from the "Jaws" movie may not be protected by copyright because its design was not registered as a sculpture.</li>
    <li>The design of the shark resembles real great white sharks, potentially making it difficult to claim copyright due to a lack of originality.</li>
    <li>The concept of "scènes à faire" suggests that generic elements of a great white shark's appearance may not be copyrightable.</li>
    <li>The shark design may have been inspired by existing photographs of real sharks, further weakening any copyright claim.</li>
    <li>While the film "Jaws" is copyrighted, the individual design of the shark may be free to use by the public.</li>
