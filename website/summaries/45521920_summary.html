    <h2>A competitor crippled a $23.5M bootcamp by becoming a Reddit moderator</h2>

<p>The article discusses a coordinated attack on the reputation of Codesmith, a software engineering residency program, on Reddit. The author, Lars Lofgren, noticed a sudden influx of negative comments and posts about Codesmith in various subreddits, particularly r/codingbootcamps. These comments often mirrored each other, using similar language and focusing on negative aspects of the program, such as its cost, intensity, and claims about job placement rates. Lofgren investigated the situation and found evidence suggesting that the negative campaign was orchestrated, potentially by competitors or disgruntled individuals.</p>

<p>The author details several key observations that led him to believe the attacks were coordinated. First, there was a sudden increase in negative posts and comments, far exceeding the usual level of discussion about Codesmith. Second, many of the accounts posting negative comments were relatively new or had low karma, raising suspicions about their authenticity. Third, the language used in the comments was often similar, suggesting a common source or script. Fourth, some of the commenters appeared to be misrepresenting or exaggerating negative experiences, or simply repeating unsubstantiated claims. Fifth, some of the accounts seemed to be promoting alternative coding bootcamps or resources, suggesting a competitive motive.</p>

<p>Lofgren also provides specific examples of comments and posts that he found suspicious, highlighting the similarities in language and the questionable nature of the claims made. He notes that while legitimate criticism of Codesmith or any coding bootcamp is valid and important, the coordinated nature of this attack suggested a deliberate attempt to damage the program's reputation unfairly. He emphasizes the importance of being aware of such tactics and encourages readers to critically evaluate information they find online, especially when it appears to be part of a coordinated campaign.</p>

<p>The article does not explicitly identify the individuals or entities behind the attack but implies that it could be competitors seeking to gain an advantage in the coding bootcamp market or individuals with a personal vendetta against Codesmith. The author also acknowledges that some of the criticism may be genuine but argues that the sheer volume and coordinated nature of the negative comments suggest a larger, more malicious effort.</p>

<p>The author concludes by urging readers to be discerning consumers of online information and to consider the source and motivations behind the content they encounter. He also suggests that online platforms should take steps to address coordinated reputation attacks and ensure that discussions are based on accurate and fair information.</p>
