<p>The article "No Instagram, No Privacy" by Wouter Jan Leyseele discusses the privacy implications of using Instagram, even without actively posting content. The author argues that merely having an Instagram account, and even passively browsing the platform, allows Meta (Instagram's parent company) to collect a significant amount of data about users, their contacts, and their interests, with or without their knowledge. </p>

<p>Leyseele begins by detailing the types of data Instagram collects. This includes obvious information like profile details (name, username, bio), content uploaded (photos, videos, stories), and interactions (likes, comments, follows). However, he emphasizes that the data collection extends far beyond direct user activity. Instagram tracks users' activity on the platform, including the accounts they view, the posts they linger on, and the searches they perform. This behavioral data is then used to build a profile of the user's interests, preferences, and social connections.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the article highlights how Instagram can infer information about users even if they don't explicitly provide it. For example, by analyzing the content a user interacts with, Instagram can deduce their age, gender, location, and even political or religious affiliations. The platform also leverages location services to track users' whereabouts, adding another layer to their personal data profile.</p>

<p>A key concern raised in the article is the extent to which Instagram tracks users' contacts. Even if a user doesn't upload their contact list, Instagram can identify their connections based on mutual followers, shared interests, and interactions. This allows Instagram to build a network of relationships around each user, further enhancing its ability to target them with personalized content and advertising.</p>

<p>The author emphasizes that this data collection is not limited to users who actively post content. Even those who only browse Instagram are still subject to tracking and profiling. Every interaction, no matter how small, contributes to the data Instagram collects.</p>

<p>Leyseele criticizes Instagram's privacy policies, arguing that they are often vague and difficult to understand. He suggests that many users are unaware of the full extent of data collection and the ways in which their information is used.</p>

<p>The article also touches upon the potential risks associated with data breaches and the misuse of personal information. The author warns that the vast amount of data collected by Instagram makes it a prime target for hackers and malicious actors. In the event of a data breach, users' personal information could be exposed, leading to identity theft, financial fraud, or other harms.</p>

<p>The article concludes by urging users to be more aware of the privacy implications of using Instagram and other social media platforms. Leyseele encourages users to take steps to protect their privacy, such as reviewing their privacy settings, limiting the amount of personal information they share, and being mindful of their online activity.</p>
