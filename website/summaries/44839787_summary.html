<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
The article discusses a significant development in the ongoing legal battles surrounding AI and copyright law. The AI industry is facing what is described as the largest copyright class action ever certified. This lawsuit involves a broad class of copyright holders who claim their works were used without permission to train AI models. The plaintiffs argue that the AI companies' practice of training their models on vast datasets of copyrighted material constitutes copyright infringement on a massive scale.

The certification of the class action is a major victory for the plaintiffs, as it allows them to pursue their claims collectively, which is far more efficient and impactful than individual lawsuits. The article emphasizes the potential implications of this case for the AI industry. If the plaintiffs are successful, it could force AI companies to fundamentally change their training practices, potentially requiring them to obtain licenses for the copyrighted material they use or develop new methods for training AI models that do not infringe on existing copyrights.

The AI industry is reportedly "horrified" by the certification, understanding the magnitude of the threat this lawsuit poses. The outcome of the case could set a precedent for future copyright disputes involving AI and reshape the legal landscape surrounding AI development and usage.
