<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
On January 7, 2024, about 13:28 local time, a Boeing 737-9 MAX, operated by Alaska Airlines as flight AS1282, experienced a rapid decompression shortly after takeoff from Portland International Airport (PDX), Portland, Oregon. The flight was en route to Ontario International Airport (ONT), Ontario, California. The incident occurred when the left mid cabin door plug, which is installed in place of an optional emergency exit door, separated from the aircraft.
</p>
<p>
The aircraft, registered as N704AL, was a relatively new Boeing 737-9 MAX, having been delivered to Alaska Airlines on October 31, 2023. The flight crew consisted of two pilots and four flight attendants. There were 171 passengers and 6 crew members on board. The aircraft reached a maximum altitude of approximately 16,000 feet before the incident.
</p>
<p>
Following the decompression, the flight crew declared an emergency and initiated a descent. They were able to return to Portland International Airport and landed safely approximately 22 minutes after the door plug separated. Despite the rapid decompression and the ensuing chaos, there were no serious injuries reported among the passengers or crew.
</p>
<p>
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) immediately launched an investigation into the incident. As part of the investigation, the NTSB examined the recovered door plug and the surrounding structure of the aircraft. The focus of the investigation is to determine why the door plug detached from the aircraft during flight.
</p>
<p>
The recovered door plug was found in the backyard of a residence in Portland, Oregon. The NTSB is analyzing the door plug for any signs of pre-existing damage, manufacturing defects, or other factors that may have contributed to the failure. They are also examining the installation process and maintenance records for the door plug to identify any potential discrepancies or errors.
</p>
<p>
The investigation is ongoing and involves multiple parties, including Alaska Airlines, Boeing, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The NTSB is collecting data from various sources, including the aircraft's flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR), as well as conducting interviews with the flight crew, passengers, and maintenance personnel.
</p>
<p>
The incident has raised concerns about the integrity of door plugs on Boeing 737-9 MAX aircraft and has led to a temporary grounding of similar aircraft by the FAA for inspections. The NTSB's final report will include a detailed analysis of the factors that led to the incident and will provide safety recommendations aimed at preventing similar occurrences in the future.
