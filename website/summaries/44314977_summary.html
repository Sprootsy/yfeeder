  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article discusses the Zed editor's debugger, its features, and the design principles behind its development. It emphasizes the importance of a good debugging experience for developers and highlights the challenges in creating a debugger that is both powerful and easy to use.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Zed debugger supports various languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Python, C, and C++, with more languages planned for future support. The debugger allows users to set breakpoints, step through code, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions. It also supports advanced features such as conditional breakpoints, logpoints, and attaching to running processes.
  </p>
  <p>
    A key aspect of the Zed debugger is its integration with the editor. The debugger UI is designed to be non-intrusive, providing debugging information directly within the editor window without obscuring the code. The article highlights the use of overlays to display variable values inline and the ability to control the debugger through keyboard shortcuts and mouse actions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The design of the Zed debugger focuses on providing a fast and responsive experience. The article mentions the use of asynchronous operations and efficient data structures to minimize delays during debugging. It also discusses the challenges of dealing with different debugging protocols and the need to abstract away the underlying debugger implementation details.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article also touches upon the collaborative debugging features planned for the future. The ability to share debugging sessions with other developers is seen as a valuable tool for remote collaboration and pair programming.
