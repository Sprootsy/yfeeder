  <p>This article by Sean Goedecke discusses the principles of good API design. It emphasizes that a good API should be easy to learn and use, even without extensive documentation. The author draws parallels between API design and UI/UX design, highlighting the importance of user experience. He suggests focusing on the "happy path" – the most common and straightforward use case – and ensuring that it's intuitive. API designers should put themselves in the shoes of the developers who will be using the API.
  </p>
  <p>The article covers several key aspects of API design. Consistency is a major theme: APIs should use consistent naming conventions, data formats, and error handling. This reduces cognitive load for developers and makes the API more predictable. The author advocates for RESTful principles, where appropriate, including the use of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes. He suggests using JSON for data serialization due to its human-readable format and widespread support.
  </p>
  <p>The article also addresses versioning. API evolution is inevitable, and the author suggests using version numbers in the API URL to allow clients to choose which version they want to use. This allows for backward-compatible changes and gives developers time to migrate to newer versions. He touches upon the importance of documentation. Although a good API should be relatively self-explanatory, comprehensive documentation is still essential for advanced features and edge cases. The author suggests tools like Swagger/OpenAPI for generating documentation.
  </p>
  <p>Error handling is another critical area. The API should provide informative error messages that help developers diagnose and fix problems. The author recommends using standard HTTP status codes to indicate the type of error. API rate limiting is also mentioned as a way to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.
  </p>
  <p>Security is briefly touched upon, with a reminder that APIs should be secured using appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., OAuth).
  </p>
  <p>In summary, the author advocates for a user-centered approach to API design, emphasizing simplicity, consistency, clear error handling, and well-maintained documentation.</p>
