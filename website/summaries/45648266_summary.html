<h2>Summary of iOS 26.1 Rumors</h2>

<p>According to a report from <i>MacRumors</i>, a purported early internal build of iOS 26.1 is circulating, revealing a potential new feature codenamed "Liquid Glass." This feature, if implemented, would introduce a system-wide toggle allowing users to adjust the level of skeuomorphism in the user interface. Skeuomorphism, characterized by design elements mimicking real-world counterparts (like shadows and textures), has been largely phased out in favor of flatter, more minimalist aesthetics in recent iOS versions.</p>

<p>The rumored "Liquid Glass" toggle would seemingly allow users to customize the visual depth and realism of interface elements, potentially enabling a return to more pronounced shadows, glossy textures, and other skeuomorphic design traits. This would offer a more tactile and visually rich experience for those who prefer it, while users who prefer the current flat design could simply leave the toggle disabled.</p>

<p>The source also mentions that the internal build is preliminary, and there is no guarantee that this feature will make it into the final release of iOS 26.1 or any future version. Apple often experiments with new features internally, and many of these never see the light of day in public releases.</p>
