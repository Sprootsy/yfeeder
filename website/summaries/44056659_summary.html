    <h2>ITXPlus: A ITX Sized Macintosh Plus Logicboard Reproduction</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p>The article discusses a project called ITXplus, which aims to reproduce the logic board of a Macintosh Plus computer in the ITX form factor. This would allow enthusiasts to build a modernized Macintosh Plus using readily available PC components for the case and power supply. The project is spearheaded by a user named 'pizzazz' on the 68kmla.org forum.</p>

<p>The original Macintosh Plus logic board is described as relatively simple, making it a good candidate for reverse engineering and reproduction. The creator outlines the initial steps, which include sourcing a Macintosh Plus for reference, taking detailed photos, and creating a schematic of the original board. They plan to use KiCad for the PCB design and are considering using a 4-layer board.</p>

<p>Several challenges are anticipated. One is adapting the original Macintosh Plus ports (such as the DE-9 serial ports and the DB-19 floppy port) to more common or readily available connectors.  Another is sourcing some of the original ICs, which may require purchasing old Macintosh Plus computers for parts or finding suitable replacements.  A significant challenge is the CRT analog video output, which is being solved through a custom adapter to HDMI and potentially a direct LCD panel replacement.</p>

<p>The thread documents the progress of the project, including discussions on the placement of components, the routing of traces, and the selection of alternative components. The community provides feedback and suggestions, particularly regarding the use of FPGAs for some of the more difficult-to-source chips and the design of the video output. The discussion also covers the possibility of adding modern features, such as Ethernet or more memory, while maintaining compatibility with the original Macintosh Plus software. The project also explores using a Raspberry Pi for the floppy disk emulation.</p>

<p>The project's goals are to create a functional reproduction of the Macintosh Plus logic board in a smaller, more modern form factor, allowing users to run classic Macintosh software on updated hardware. The ITXplus project is still a work in progress, with ongoing discussions and refinements to the design.</p>
