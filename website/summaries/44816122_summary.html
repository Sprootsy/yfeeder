  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
   The Microsoft article discusses the compatibility of 16-bit applications with Windows 8. It explains that Windows 8 and later versions of Windows (including Windows 10 and 11) do not natively support 16-bit applications. This is because these operating systems are designed with a different architecture that is incompatible with the older 16-bit technology.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article elaborates on the reasons for this incompatibility, highlighting that 16-bit applications require a specific subsystem (NTVDM - NT Virtual DOS Machine) that is not included in the 64-bit versions of Windows. While 32-bit versions of Windows XP could run 16-bit applications using NTVDM, the transition to more modern operating systems has phased out this support.
  </p>
  <p>
   The discussion further suggests alternative solutions for users who still need to run 16-bit applications. One primary recommendation is to use virtualization software such as VMware or VirtualBox. These tools allow users to create a virtual machine running an older operating system like Windows XP or an earlier version that supports 16-bit applications. Within this virtual environment, the 16-bit application can run as it would on its native operating system.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another suggested workaround is to use DOSBox, an emulator specifically designed for running DOS-based applications. While DOSBox is primarily intended for DOS programs, it can sometimes be used to run certain 16-bit Windows applications if they rely heavily on DOS functionality.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article emphasizes that direct execution of 16-bit applications is not possible on modern Windows versions and that using virtualization or emulation are the most viable options for running these older programs.

   <li>Windows 8 and later versions (Windows 10, Windows 11) do not natively support 16-bit applications.</li>
   <li>64-bit versions of Windows do not include the NTVDM (NT Virtual DOS Machine) subsystem required for running 16-bit applications.</li>
   <li>The primary solution is to use virtualization software (VMware, VirtualBox) to run a virtual machine with an older, compatible operating system (e.g., Windows XP).</li>
   <li>DOSBox can be used as an emulator for DOS-based applications, and sometimes for certain 16-bit Windows applications with DOS dependencies.</li>
   <li>Directly opening 16-bit applications in modern Windows versions is not possible.</li>
