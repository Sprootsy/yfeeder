  <p>Summary:</p>
  <p>The article "From Data to Decisions: A Survey of Risk-Aware Decision-Making" provides a comprehensive overview of risk-aware decision-making (RADM) approaches. It emphasizes the increasing importance of explicitly considering risk in decision-making processes, particularly in complex and uncertain environments. The survey covers various facets of RADM, ranging from foundational concepts to practical applications, and highlights the interdisciplinary nature of the field, drawing from areas such as operations research, artificial intelligence, economics, and control theory.</p>
  <p>The article begins by defining risk and outlining different types of risk measures, including those based on probabilities, quantiles, and coherent risk measures. It discusses the importance of accurately quantifying and representing risk preferences, noting that decision-makers' attitudes toward risk can significantly influence optimal strategies. Various utility functions and risk preference models are examined. The survey also explores methods for learning risk preferences from data, which is crucial when explicit elicitation is difficult or impossible.</p>
  <p>The survey then delves into different decision-making frameworks incorporating risk. These include stochastic programming, robust optimization, and distributionally robust optimization. Stochastic programming addresses uncertainty by modeling it using probability distributions and optimizing expected outcomes or other risk-related criteria. Robust optimization focuses on finding solutions that are feasible and near-optimal under the worst-case realization of uncertain parameters. Distributionally robust optimization bridges the gap between stochastic and robust optimization by considering ambiguity sets of probability distributions instead of relying on a single distribution or worst-case scenarios.</p>
  <p>The article also explores the use of reinforcement learning (RL) in risk-aware settings. It discusses various RL algorithms adapted to incorporate risk measures directly into the learning objective or to learn policies that satisfy specific risk constraints. This includes approaches such as risk-sensitive Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and algorithms that optimize Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) or other risk metrics.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the survey addresses the computational challenges associated with RADM. It discusses approximation techniques, decomposition methods, and sampling-based approaches used to solve large-scale risk-aware optimization problems. The article also touches upon the use of simulation and scenario generation techniques for evaluating the performance of RADM strategies under different risk scenarios.</p>
  <p>Finally, the article presents a range of applications of RADM in various domains, including finance, supply chain management, energy systems, healthcare, and robotics. In each application area, the survey highlights how risk-aware approaches can lead to more effective and robust decision-making compared to traditional risk-neutral methods.</p>
