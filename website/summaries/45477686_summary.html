    <h2>Unchecked and Unaccountable: How DOGE Jeopardizes Americans&#39; Data</h2>
    <div>

  <p>A report led by Senator Gary Peters has raised serious concerns about the privacy and security practices of Doge, a company that collects and publishes individuals' personal information online. The report alleges that Doge operates without proper safeguards, likely violating federal privacy and security laws, thereby endangering the personal information of Americans. The investigation was initiated following numerous reports and complaints regarding Doge's data collection methods and the potential misuse of the information it compiles.</p>
  
  <p>The central finding of the report is that Doge aggregates personal data from various sources, including publicly available records, data brokers, and social media platforms, to create detailed profiles of individuals. This information includes names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, family relationships, employment history, and other sensitive details. The report highlights that Doge does not obtain consent from individuals before collecting and publishing their data, nor does it provide a clear and accessible mechanism for individuals to opt out or correct inaccuracies in their profiles.</p>
  
  <p>Furthermore, the report questions Doge's compliance with federal privacy laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Driver's Privacy Protection Act (DPPA). It suggests that Doge's activities may fall under the purview of the FCRA if the information it provides is used for determining an individual's eligibility for credit, insurance, or employment. Additionally, the report raises concerns about potential violations of the DPPA, which restricts the disclosure of personal information obtained from state motor vehicle records.</p>
  
  <p>The report also criticizes Doge's security measures, asserting that the company fails to adequately protect the sensitive data it collects from unauthorized access and cyber threats. It notes that Doge's website and databases may be vulnerable to hacking, which could result in the mass exposure of personal information. The lack of robust security protocols raises the risk of identity theft, stalking, harassment, and other forms of harm to individuals whose data is compromised.</p>
  
  <p>In light of these findings, the report recommends that federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), investigate Doge's practices and take appropriate enforcement actions to ensure compliance with privacy and security laws. It also calls for Congress to consider strengthening existing privacy laws and enacting new legislation to address the risks posed by data brokers and online platforms that collect and disseminate personal information without adequate safeguards.</p>
  
  <p>Overall, the report paints a concerning picture of Doge's operations, emphasizing the potential for significant harm to individuals whose personal information is exposed and misused. It underscores the need for greater oversight and regulation of the data broker industry to protect Americans' privacy and security in the digital age.</p>
