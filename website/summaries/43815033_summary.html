        <h1>AI Coding assistants provide little value because a programmer&#39;s job is to think</h1>

  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The article "Programming Is A Thinker's Game" argues that programming is fundamentally an intellectual activity, a form of applied philosophy, rather than simply a technical skill. It emphasizes that successful programming relies heavily on critical thinking, problem-solving, logic, and a deep understanding of the underlying principles of computation. The author contends that while tools and technologies evolve rapidly, the core principles of thinking and reasoning remain constant and are crucial for a programmer's long-term success. It is the ability to analyze problems, devise effective solutions, and articulate those solutions clearly that sets apart a proficient programmer.</p>
  <p>The article starts by challenging the common perception of programming as merely writing code. Instead, it posits that programming is about understanding the essence of a problem and formulating a clear, logical plan to solve it. The author uses the analogy of programming being closer to philosophy than to, say, bricklaying, highlighting that programmers must deal with abstract concepts, define relationships between entities, and create systems that behave predictably.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the article stresses the importance of problem decomposition. Complex problems should be broken down into smaller, manageable sub-problems, which can then be addressed individually. This approach simplifies the overall task and makes it easier to develop and test solutions. The author underlines that this ability to decompose a problem effectively is a hallmark of a skilled programmer.</p>
  <p>Another critical point is the need for clear and precise communication. Programmers must be able to articulate their ideas, both in code and in plain language. They need to explain their solutions to others, whether it's fellow developers, stakeholders, or end-users. Clear communication ensures that everyone is on the same page and helps to avoid misunderstandings and errors.</p>
  <p>The author also delves into the importance of understanding data structures and algorithms. These are fundamental building blocks of programming, and a solid grasp of them enables programmers to write efficient and effective code. The article emphasizes that choosing the right data structure or algorithm can have a significant impact on the performance of a program.</p>
  <p>The article concludes by reinforcing the idea that while specific programming languages and tools may come and go, the ability to think critically and solve problems will always be in demand. By focusing on developing these core thinking skills, programmers can ensure their long-term success in the field. The author advocates for a shift in perspective, from viewing programming as a set of technical skills to recognizing it as a demanding and rewarding intellectual pursuit.</p>
