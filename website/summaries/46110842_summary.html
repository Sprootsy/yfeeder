    The article describes Ghostty Web, a cloud-based terminal emulator,
    accessible via a web browser. Ghostty Web is presented as an alternative
    to traditional desktop terminal applications and aims to provide a
    seamless, feature-rich terminal experience within a web browser. It is
    built using web technologies and Go on the backend and is part of the
    Ghostty project, which seeks to reimagine the terminal experience.

    The architecture section details the components involved, such as the
    frontend (written in web technologies like TypeScript, React and WebAssembly),
    the backend (written in Go), and the communication protocols used between
    them (likely WebSockets). It also mentions how Ghostty Web can be deployed
    in various cloud environments and how it integrates with existing
    infrastructure.
