<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Teachable Machine is a web-based tool developed by Google that allows users to create machine learning models quickly and easily, without requiring coding expertise or extensive technical knowledge. It simplifies the process of training machine learning models for image, audio, and pose recognition by providing a user-friendly interface. Users can train models directly in the browser by uploading or capturing examples of the data they want the model to recognize. The platform then uses these examples to train a custom machine learning model.</p>

<p>The tool supports three primary types of projects: image projects, audio projects, and pose projects. In image projects, users can train the model to recognize different images by uploading images into different classes. For audio projects, the model learns to recognize different sounds. Similarly, pose projects enable the model to identify different body positions or movements based on camera input.</p>

<p>Once a model is trained, users can test it directly within the Teachable Machine interface to see how well it performs. If the model doesn't perform as expected, users can add more examples to improve its accuracy. After the model is satisfactory, it can be exported in various formats, including TensorFlow.js, TensorFlow Lite, and a standard TensorFlow format. These formats allow the models to be deployed on websites, mobile apps, and other applications.</p>

<p>Teachable Machine is designed to be accessible to a wide audience, including educators, artists, students, and anyone interested in exploring machine learning. It democratizes AI by removing the technical barriers typically associated with machine learning model development. The platform encourages creativity and experimentation, allowing users to quickly prototype and implement machine learning solutions in their projects.</p>
