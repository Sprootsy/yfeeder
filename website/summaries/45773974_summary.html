  <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is joining a growing number of European organizations in moving away from Big Tech software in favor of open-source alternatives. This decision stems from concerns about digital sovereignty, data security, and the desire to reduce reliance on US-based tech giants. The ECDC is replacing Microsoft Office with Nextcloud, Collabora Online, and other open-source tools. This migration aims to provide the agency with more control over its data and IT infrastructure, aligning with the broader European movement towards digital independence. The ECDC's move follows similar decisions by other European entities, such as the German Federal Labour Court and the city of Munich, which have opted for open-source solutions to enhance security, control, and cost-effectiveness. The shift also reflects a growing awareness of the potential risks associated with entrusting sensitive data to foreign companies, particularly in light of evolving data protection regulations and geopolitical considerations. The transition is expected to enhance the ECDC's ability to collaborate securely and efficiently while maintaining greater control over its digital assets. Furthermore, the adoption of open-source solutions is seen as a way to foster innovation and support the development of European tech companies.</p>
