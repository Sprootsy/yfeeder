    According to The Walrus article, the publishing industry is increasingly reliant on bestsellers to stay afloat, leading to a winner-takes-all market that disadvantages mid-list authors and smaller publishers. This dependence on a few blockbuster titles creates instability and risk within the industry. The focus on potential bestsellers influences acquisitions, marketing, and overall publishing strategies, often at the expense of literary merit and diversity.

    The article describes how the pursuit of bestsellers leads to a concentration of resources on books deemed most likely to succeed commercially, while other worthy books may be neglected. This can result in a lack of discoverability for a wide range of authors and stories, stifling creativity and innovation. Additionally, the pressure to generate hits can lead to risk-averse decision-making, with publishers favouring familiar genres and established authors over taking chances on new voices and experimental works.

    The current publishing model often results in mid-list authors, who form the backbone of the industry, struggling to earn a living. Their books may receive minimal marketing support, and they face increasing difficulty in gaining visibility in a market saturated with high-profile releases. This can lead to authors leaving the profession, diminishing the overall quality and diversity of published works.

    The article also touches on the impact of Amazon on the publishing landscape. Amazon's dominance in book sales and its focus on algorithms and data-driven recommendations further exacerbate the bestseller phenomenon, prioritizing commercially successful titles over others.
