    <h2>Why &#34;everyone dies&#34; gets AGI all wrong</h2>

<p>The article by Ben Goertzel discusses common misconceptions about Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), death, and the relationship between the two. Goertzel argues that many people misunderstand the nature of AGI and its potential impact on humanity, particularly in the context of lifespan extension and potential post-biological existence. He criticizes simplistic views of AGI as merely a tool or a slightly enhanced version of current AI, emphasizing that true AGI would possess a level of autonomy, adaptability, and self-understanding that far surpasses anything we have today.</p>

<p>Goertzel argues against the common fear that AGI will inevitably destroy humanity, suggesting that this fear stems from a lack of imagination regarding the potential for beneficial AGI development. He proposes that AGI, with proper ethical grounding, could be instrumental in solving some of humanity's most pressing problems, including aging and death.</p>

<p>The article challenges the common perception of death as an unavoidable biological imperative. Goertzel suggests that aging and death are primarily consequences of biological processes that, in principle, can be understood and overcome. He posits that AGI could accelerate the development of technologies to extend human lifespan significantly, potentially leading to a form of indefinite lifespan.</p>

<p>Goertzel also delves into the philosophical implications of AGI and extended lifespans. He discusses the possibility of transitioning human consciousness into non-biological substrates, such as advanced computer systems. He suggests that this could lead to new forms of existence and exploration of reality that are currently beyond our comprehension. The article touches upon the potential for AGI to develop its own unique forms of consciousness and experience, which may be vastly different from human consciousness.</p>

<p>He also cautions against anthropomorphizing AGI and assuming that its motivations and goals will necessarily align with human values. Instead, he advocates for proactive efforts to guide the development of AGI in a way that promotes beneficial outcomes for humanity and the broader universe.</p>

<p>The article concludes by emphasizing the need for a more nuanced and imaginative understanding of AGI and its potential impact on the future of humanity. He urges researchers, policymakers, and the public to engage in open and informed discussions about the ethical and societal implications of AGI, to ensure that its development is guided by wisdom and foresight.</p>
