    According to an article by Ken Klippenstein, a Trump-era National Security Presidential Memorandum (NSPM-7), drafted in 2017, labeled several common beliefs and political viewpoints as potential indicators of violent extremism. The document, titled "Countering Violent Extremism," identified ideologies across the political spectrum, associating them with potential terrorist activity.
  </p>
  <p>
    The NSPM-7 listed various beliefs that it suggested could be linked to violent extremism. Among these were:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Opposition to abortion.</li>
    <li>Beliefs regarding excessive government control.</li>
    <li>Concerns about illegal immigration.</li>
    <li>Advocacy for gun rights.</li>
    <li>Beliefs associated with Black nationalism.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The document suggests that individuals holding these beliefs should be given scrutiny, raising concerns about the potential for government overreach and the targeting of individuals based on their political views.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article highlights the breadth of ideologies included in the memorandum, spanning both left-leaning and right-leaning viewpoints. This suggests a broad net being cast in the effort to identify potential extremists. The inclusion of commonly held beliefs as indicators of violent extremism raises concerns about the potential for misidentification and the infringement of civil liberties.
  </p>
  <p>
    The NSPM-7 faced criticism for potentially conflating legitimate political discourse with genuine threats of violence. Critics argued that the document could lead to the surveillance and targeting of individuals and groups based on their beliefs, rather than on any actual evidence of violent intent or activity.
