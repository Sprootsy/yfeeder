    <h2>EU Eyes Ditching Microsoft Azure for France&#39;s OVHcloud</h2>
    <div>

  <p>According to a scoop by Euractiv, the European Commission is considering switching from Microsoft Azure to OVHcloud, a French cloud service provider, due to concerns about digital sovereignty. The Commission fears that using US-based cloud services like Azure could expose sensitive EU data to foreign surveillance, particularly under laws like the US CLOUD Act. This act allows US authorities to access data stored on servers controlled by US companies, regardless of where those servers are located.</p>
  <p>The potential move to OVHcloud is driven by a desire to maintain control over EU data and ensure compliance with European data protection regulations, such as GDPR. OVHcloud is seen as a more secure option because it is based in the EU and subject to EU laws. The Commission is reportedly exploring ways to develop its own "sovereign cloud" infrastructure, and the shift to OVHcloud could be a step in that direction. This initiative aligns with broader EU efforts to strengthen its digital autonomy and reduce reliance on foreign technology providers.</p>
  <p>The Commission's concerns also stem from the increasing geopolitical tensions and the potential for data breaches or cyberattacks. By using a European cloud provider, the Commission aims to mitigate these risks and safeguard sensitive information related to its operations. The move could also set a precedent for other EU institutions and member states, encouraging them to prioritize digital sovereignty when choosing cloud services.</p>
  <p>The decision to switch to OVHcloud is still under consideration, and the Commission is likely to conduct a thorough assessment of the technical and economic implications. However, the fact that it is being seriously considered reflects the growing importance of digital sovereignty in the EU's political agenda. The Commission is actively seeking ways to ensure that its data is protected and that it has control over its digital infrastructure.</p>
  <p>This potential shift highlights the ongoing debate about the balance between using established cloud providers and fostering European alternatives. While US-based providers offer scalability and a wide range of services, they also raise concerns about data security and compliance with EU regulations. The Commission's move could provide a boost to European cloud providers like OVHcloud and encourage further investment in the European cloud sector.</p>
  <p>The article underscores the EU's increasing focus on digital sovereignty and its determination to protect its data and infrastructure from foreign interference. The potential switch from Microsoft Azure to OVHcloud is a concrete example of this commitment and a signal that the EU is willing to take bold steps to achieve its digital autonomy goals.</p>
