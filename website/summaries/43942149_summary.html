  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>
    This article is a detailed explanation of how to create a WebGL water effect using various techniques. It covers the rendering process, including the use of shaders to simulate realistic water behavior. The author focuses on achieving a balance between visual fidelity and performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article starts by setting up the basic WebGL environment and loading the necessary extensions. It then delves into the geometry of the water surface, discussing the use of a grid for representing the water and how to optimize it for rendering. The author also explores different methods for generating waves, including simple sine waves and more complex techniques like Gerstner waves.

    Shaders play a crucial role in creating the water effect. The article provides detailed explanations of the vertex and fragment shaders used. The vertex shader is responsible for displacing the vertices of the grid to create the wave motion, while the fragment shader handles the coloring and lighting of the water surface.

    Reflection and refraction are key components of the water effect. The author explains how to use framebuffers to render the scene from the perspective of the water, creating reflection and refraction textures. These textures are then used in the fragment shader to simulate the way light interacts with water.

    The article also discusses the use of normal maps to add detail to the water surface. Normal maps are textures that store the direction of the surface normal at each point, allowing for the simulation of small-scale ripples and waves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lighting is another important aspect of the water effect. The author explains how to use the Phong lighting model to calculate the diffuse and specular components of the light reflected from the water surface. This helps to create a more realistic and visually appealing effect.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, the article covers various optimization techniques for improving the performance of the WebGL water effect. These include reducing the number of vertices in the grid, using lower-resolution textures, and simplifying the shaders.
