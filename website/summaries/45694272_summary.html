  <p>The article on GitHub, titled "tiny8", introduces a minimalist 8-bit virtual machine and associated assembler written in standard C. The project aims to provide a simple, educational platform for understanding computer architecture and low-level programming concepts. It is designed to be easily understandable and modifiable, making it suitable for learning purposes. The virtual machine includes a basic instruction set, memory model, and I/O capabilities. The assembler translates human-readable assembly code into machine code that the virtual machine can execute. The repository provides the source code for both the virtual machine and the assembler, along with example programs and documentation to help users get started. The project emphasizes simplicity and clarity, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about computer architecture, assembly language programming, or virtual machine design. The repository also includes instructions on how to build and run the virtual machine and assembler on different platforms. It is intended to serve as a foundation for further experimentation and development, encouraging users to modify and extend the virtual machine and assembler to suit their needs. The project's documentation covers the architecture of the virtual machine, the syntax of the assembly language, and the usage of the assembler and virtual machine tools. It also includes examples of how to write simple programs for the virtual machine, demonstrating the use of various instructions and addressing modes.</p>
