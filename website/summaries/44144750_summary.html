<p>The article describes the author's journey in creating a highly accurate and precise clock, the Precision Clock Mk. IV. The project aims to achieve timekeeping accuracy superior to typical real-time clocks (RTCs) and even Network Time Protocol (NTP) synchronization. The author details the hardware and software design choices, challenges faced, and solutions implemented. The clock uses a temperature-compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO) as its primary time source, which is further disciplined by a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to correct for long-term drift. The system employs a microcontroller (an ESP32) to manage the GPS data, control the TCXO's frequency via a DAC, and display the time. A key challenge was mitigating the effects of temperature variations on the TCXO's frequency. The author experimented with different temperature sensors and control algorithms to achieve optimal temperature compensation. The clock also includes a web interface for monitoring its performance and configuring settings. The project demonstrates a combination of hardware and software techniques to achieve high-precision timekeeping.</p>
