  <h3>Summary:</h3>
  <p>The article "Every Industry Is An Overcrowded Industry" argues that regardless of the specific field, every industry feels saturated and competitive. It explores the reasons behind this perception of overcrowding and offers a perspective shift for individuals and businesses looking to thrive. The author contends that this feeling of saturation stems from a combination of factors, including low barriers to entry in the digital age, increased access to information and resources, and the human tendency to compare ourselves to others. Furthermore, the article challenges the notion that success is a zero-sum game, where one person's gain necessarily means another's loss. Instead, it promotes the idea that value creation and differentiation are key strategies for standing out in a crowded market. The author suggests that focusing on identifying unmet needs, developing unique solutions, and building strong relationships can help individuals and businesses carve out their own space and achieve success, even in seemingly overcrowded industries. Ultimately, the article encourages readers to adopt a mindset of abundance and innovation, rather than being discouraged by the perception of market saturation. It offers practical advice on how to differentiate oneself, find niche opportunities, and create genuine value for customers.</p>
