    <h2>An Efilist Just Bombed a Fertility Clinic. Was This Bound to Happen?</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <p>Summary:</p>
  <p>The article discusses the bombing of a fertility clinic in Toronto and identifies the bomber as an individual influenced by Effective Accelerationism, also known as e/acc. The author explains e/acc as an ideology that combines aspects of Effective Altruism (EA) with accelerationist thought. While EA focuses on maximizing positive outcomes and minimizing suffering through rational analysis, e/acc merges this with the idea that accelerating technological and societal change, regardless of the risks, is the best way to achieve a better future. The author contrasts EA's more cautious and evidence-based approach with e/acc's embrace of radical and potentially dangerous actions to force change. The article highlights that while most people involved in EA do not condone violence or illegal activities, the bomber's actions raise concerns about the potential for extremist interpretations and applications of these ideas. It also explores the tension between EA's focus on long-term goals and e/acc's more immediate and disruptive tactics. The author suggests that this incident underscores the need for greater scrutiny and critical examination of the potential consequences of ideologies that advocate for rapid and uncontrolled change, even if they are initially rooted in seemingly positive intentions.</p>
