    <h2>How good engineers write bad code at big companies</h2>

<p>The article "Bad Code at Big Companies" by Sean Goedecke discusses the prevalence of bad code within large, established tech companies, challenging the common assumption that only startups struggle with code quality. Goedecke argues that despite having ample resources, experienced engineers, and established processes, big companies often harbor significant amounts of poorly written, difficult-to-maintain code. The article explores several reasons for this phenomenon. One primary cause is the accumulation of technical debt over time. As companies grow and prioritize shipping features quickly to meet market demands, shortcuts are often taken and best practices are sometimes ignored. This results in a codebase that becomes increasingly complex and fragile, making future development slower and more error-prone.</p>

<p>Another contributing factor is the "not invented here" syndrome, where teams are reluctant to adopt existing solutions or libraries, preferring to build their own from scratch. This can lead to duplication of effort, inconsistent implementations, and increased complexity. Organizational silos and a lack of communication between teams also exacerbate the problem. When teams operate independently, they may make conflicting design decisions or introduce incompatible code, making integration and maintenance more difficult. Furthermore, the article highlights the challenges of refactoring large, complex codebases. Refactoring can be a risky and time-consuming undertaking, and it often gets deprioritized in favor of new feature development. This can lead to a situation where bad code persists for years, becoming increasingly entrenched in the system.</p>

<p>The article also touches on the impact of legacy systems. Many large companies have systems that have been in operation for decades, and these systems may be written in outdated languages or use obsolete technologies. Maintaining these systems can be a major challenge, and it can be difficult to attract and retain engineers who are willing to work on them. Moreover, the constant pressure to deliver new features can lead to a culture of "quick fixes" and hacks, which further degrades the quality of the codebase. The article suggests that addressing the problem of bad code requires a multi-faceted approach. It emphasizes the importance of investing in code quality, promoting best practices, and fostering a culture of collaboration and communication. It also highlights the need for effective leadership and a willingness to prioritize refactoring and technical debt reduction. By recognizing the challenges and taking proactive steps to address them, big companies can improve the quality of their code and ensure the long-term maintainability and scalability of their systems.</p>
