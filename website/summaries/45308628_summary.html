<p>The Trump administration planned to propose a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications to fund job training programs. This proposal, if enacted, would significantly increase the cost for companies employing foreign workers in the United States. The fee was intended to generate revenue for initiatives aimed at training American workers, aligning with the administration's broader "America First" agenda.
</p>
<p>The proposed fee was met with criticism from various stakeholders, including businesses and immigration advocates. Concerns were raised about the potential negative impact on the U.S. economy, as companies might reconsider hiring foreign specialized workers due to the increased financial burden. Additionally, some critics argued that the fee would make it more difficult for U.S. companies to compete in the global market.
</p>
<p>It's important to note that the proposal was never implemented.
