<h2>Summary:</h2>

The U.S. Armed Forces have prohibited service members from registering or operating the Tesla Cybertruck on military installations. The ban stems from the Cybertruck's non-compliance with the Department of Defense's safety standards outlined in DOD Instruction 6055.04, specifically concerning vehicle safety. The regulation mandates that privately owned vehicles (POVs) operating on military bases must meet certain safety requirements, including having rounded edges and pedestrian-friendly designs to minimize potential harm in the event of a collision. The Cybertruck's sharp, angular design, particularly its stainless-steel body panels, poses a significant risk to pedestrians and other vehicles, making it non-compliant with these safety standards. While some military branches initially considered allowing the Cybertruck on bases, the DOD ultimately decided to enforce the existing safety regulations uniformly across all branches. This decision reflects the military's commitment to maintaining a safe environment for all personnel and civilians on its installations. The ban applies to all service members, regardless of rank or duty station, and aims to prevent potential injuries and property damage associated with the Cybertruck's unique design.
