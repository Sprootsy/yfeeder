  <p>According to <em>The National News</em> article, a copy of Jerry Lewis's infamous and unreleased film, <em>The Day the Clown Cried</em>, has been discovered and is now in the possession of the Library of Congress. The film, completed in 1972, tells the story of a German circus clown named Helmut Dorque who ends up leading Jewish children to their deaths in Auschwitz. This premise has made it a subject of great controversy and curiosity for decades.</p>
  <p>Lewis, who both directed and starred in the film, largely kept it locked away, and it has never been officially released. Over the years, there have been scattered reports and rumors about its existence and content, contributing to its almost mythical status. Many who have seen it, or claim to have seen it, have described it as a deeply flawed and misjudged project. Some have suggested that the film's failure led Lewis to keep it out of the public eye, perhaps out of embarrassment or regret.</p>
  <p>The Library of Congress acquired the copy as part of a larger collection of Lewis's work that he donated before his death in 2017. The agreement stipulated that <em>The Day the Clown Cried</em> could not be screened until at least 2024. Now that the embargo has passed, the Library of Congress is in possession of the film and is undertaking the task of preserving it. There is anticipation within film circles and among historians about the possibility of eventually seeing the film, though no public screenings or releases have been announced.</p>
  <p>The article highlights the ethical and artistic questions raised by the film's subject matter. The idea of using humor, especially clowning, in the context of the Holocaust is inherently contentious. Some critics and scholars have argued that such a concept is inherently tasteless or offensive, while others suggest that it could potentially be a powerful, albeit risky, way to explore the horrors of that period.</p>
  <p>The discovery and preservation of <em>The Day the Clown Cried</em> ensures that it will be available for future generations of film scholars and historians to study, regardless of its artistic merit or lack thereof. It remains a significant, if troubled, part of Jerry Lewis's legacy and a unique case study in the challenges and potential pitfalls of filmmaking.</p>
