    <h2>Goiaba: An experimental Go compiler, written in Rust</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <p>The article describes "goiaba," a Go library providing utility functions, data structures, and extensions that are often missing from the standard Go library. Goiaba aims to offer a collection of practical tools to simplify common programming tasks and improve developer productivity. The library is structured into several modules, each addressing a specific area of functionality. These modules include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Arrays:</b> Provides functions for manipulating arrays, such as checking if an array contains a specific element, finding the index of an element, or removing duplicates.</li>
    <li><b>Strings:</b> Offers utilities for string manipulation, including functions for trimming whitespace, converting strings to different cases, and checking if a string starts or ends with a specific substring.</li>
    <li><b>Numbers:</b> Includes functions for working with numeric types, such as generating random numbers within a specified range, rounding numbers, and converting between different numeric types.</li>
    <li><b>Collections:</b> Implements common collection data structures, such as sets, maps, and stacks, with additional functionalities like filtering, mapping, and reducing elements within the collection.</li>
    <li><b>Types:</b> Offers type-checking and conversion utilities, including functions for determining the type of a variable and converting it to a different type safely.</li>
    <li><b>Functions:</b> Provides higher-order functions and function utilities, such as memoization, function composition, and function currying.</li>
    <li><b>Times:</b> Includes utilities for working with time and date values, such as formatting dates, calculating time differences, and manipulating time zones.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The library emphasizes ease of use and a clean API. The goal is to reduce boilerplate code and provide developers with ready-to-use solutions for common problems. The documentation provides examples of how to use each function and data structure, making it easy to integrate goiaba into existing Go projects.</p>
