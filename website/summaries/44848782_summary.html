  <p>Debian, a widely-used free operating system, is approaching its next major release, Debian 13, codenamed Trixie. The development cycle for Trixie has officially begun following the release of Debian 12, Bookworm, in June 2023. As is the Debian tradition, Trixie follows an alphabetical naming convention, taking the name after a character from the Toy Story franchise. The announcement signals to Debian developers, contributors, and users that the focus has shifted toward the new release. </p>

  <p>The development process involves transitioning from the 'testing' distribution, which Bookworm was prior to its stable release, to housing new package versions and features destined for Trixie. The article also mentions the 'unstable' distribution, codenamed Sid, which continuously receives the latest package updates but is not intended for production use due to its inherent instability. Packages are migrated from Sid to Testing (Trixie) after undergoing a period of testing and stability checks. The Debian release team will monitor the status of Trixie, addressing critical bugs and ensuring the overall quality of the distribution. As Trixie matures, it will eventually transition into the 'stable' release, at which point a new 'testing' distribution will be created to begin the cycle anew.
