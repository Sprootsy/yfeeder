  <p>The article reports that YouTube has removed numerous videos providing tutorials on how to bypass Windows 11's hardware requirements, specifically the TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot requirements. These videos demonstrated methods for installing Windows 11 on older or unsupported hardware. The takedowns were reportedly due to copyright claims filed by Microsoft. While the exact legal justification for the copyright claims is unclear, it appears Microsoft is asserting copyright over elements within the Windows 11 installation process that are being modified or circumvented in these bypass methods. The removal of these videos makes it more difficult for users with older PCs to find instructions on installing Windows 11 without meeting the official hardware specifications. The article suggests that these actions by YouTube are a result of Microsoft's efforts to enforce its hardware requirements for Windows 11.</p>
