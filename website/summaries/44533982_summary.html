    <h2>Pa. House passes &#39;click-to-cancel&#39; subscription bills</h2>

  <p>The Pennsylvania House of Representatives has passed two bills aimed at making it easier for consumers to cancel online subscriptions. These bills, known as the "click-to-cancel" bills, require businesses offering online subscriptions to provide a simple online method for cancellation. This method must be the same one the consumer used to sign up for the subscription in the first place. The goal is to prevent companies from trapping customers in unwanted subscriptions by making cancellation difficult or requiring them to jump through hoops.</p>

  <p>One of the bills, House Bill 1350, focuses on general online subscriptions. It mandates that businesses allow consumers to cancel their subscriptions online if they initially enrolled online. The cancellation process should be straightforward and not involve excessive steps or phone calls. The other bill, House Bill 1351, specifically addresses subscriptions for automatically renewing products and services. It also requires a simple online cancellation option.</p>

  <p>These bills come at a time when the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is also trying to crack down on deceptive subscription practices. However, a federal court recently struck down an FTC rule targeting such practices, creating uncertainty at the federal level. The Pennsylvania legislation is therefore seen as a way to protect consumers in the state regardless of federal action.</p>

  <p>The bills have received support from both Democrats and Republicans in the House, indicating broad agreement on the need to protect consumers from unfair subscription practices. Supporters argue that these bills will empower consumers and prevent them from being charged for services they no longer want.</p>

  <p>It is important to note that the bills still need to pass the Pennsylvania Senate and be signed into law by the governor before they take effect. The future of these bills is thus still uncertain.</p>
