  <h2>Summary of Ovi by Character AI</h2>
  <p>Ovi is a research project by Character AI focused on building embodied agents capable of operating in complex, visually rich simulated environments. The project aims to create agents that can not only navigate and interact with their surroundings but also exhibit human-like behavior, complete tasks, and understand instructions given in natural language. The core motivation behind Ovi is to bridge the gap between the capabilities of current AI models and the embodied intelligence necessary for real-world applications.</p>

  <p>The Ovi framework revolves around a simulated 3D environment where agents can interact with objects and other actors. The agents are equipped with visual perception, allowing them to "see" and interpret their surroundings. They also possess natural language understanding, enabling them to comprehend and respond to instructions provided by users. The architecture involves training agents using a combination of techniques, including reinforcement learning and imitation learning, to perform tasks and achieve goals within the simulated world.</p>

  <p>Key aspects of the Ovi project include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Embodied AI:</strong> Focuses on creating AI agents that exist and interact within a physical or simulated environment.</li>
    <li><strong>Visual Perception:</strong> Agents are equipped with the ability to process and understand visual information from their surroundings.</li>
    <li><strong>Natural Language Understanding:</strong> Agents can interpret and respond to instructions given in natural language.</li>
    <li><strong>Task Completion:</strong> Agents are trained to perform specific tasks and achieve goals within the simulated environment.</li>
    <li><strong>Simulated Environment:</strong> A 3D environment where agents can interact with objects and other actors.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Ovi's development is driven by the desire to create more capable and versatile AI systems that can eventually be deployed in real-world scenarios. The project represents a significant step towards building AI agents that can understand and interact with the world in a more human-like way.</p>
