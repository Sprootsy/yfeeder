<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>Japan's Defense Ministry has requested a record budget of 7.738 trillion yen ($49.9 billion) for fiscal 2024, marking a significant increase aimed at bolstering the nation's defense capabilities amid a challenging security environment. This proposed budget, up 12.9% from the initial budget for the current fiscal year, is part of a broader effort to achieve a target of doubling defense spending to 2% of GDP by fiscal 2027. The request includes funds for acquiring stand-off defense capabilities, strengthening air defense, and enhancing unmanned defense capabilities, as well as improving the working environment for Self-Defense Forces personnel.</p>
<p>A key focus of the budget request is the acquisition of stand-off defense capabilities, which would allow Japan to strike enemy targets from a distance. This includes plans to mass-produce domestically made cruise missiles and improve the range of existing missiles. The ministry also seeks to strengthen its air defense capabilities by procuring interceptor missiles, including the U.S.-made SM-6, and developing a next-generation interceptor missile jointly with the United States. Furthermore, the budget allocates funds for research and development of unmanned defense capabilities, such as unmanned surface vehicles, to address manpower shortages and enhance operational effectiveness.</p>
<p>In addition to hardware investments, the Defense Ministry aims to improve the working environment for Self-Defense Forces personnel. This includes measures to enhance recruitment, retain talent, and address concerns related to long working hours and insufficient compensation. The ministry also seeks to strengthen cybersecurity measures to protect against cyberattacks and ensure the security of critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>The record budget request reflects Japan's growing concerns about the security environment in the region, including China's increasing military assertiveness and North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. By investing in advanced defense capabilities and improving the working conditions for its personnel, Japan aims to enhance its deterrence and response capabilities and contribute to regional peace and stability.</p>
