<div>
<p>The Caddy project is seeking new maintainers to ensure its continued growth and success. The current lead maintainer, Matt Holt, has been managing the project largely single-handedly for years and needs assistance to prevent burnout and ensure the project's long-term viability. The announcement emphasizes that Caddy is at a critical point where its future depends on expanding the maintainership team.</p>

<p>Matt Holt expresses the need for additional maintainers to help with various tasks, including reviewing code contributions (pull requests), triaging issues, participating in community discussions, and guiding the project's overall direction. He acknowledges that he has been the primary bottleneck for too long and that the project's growth has been constrained by his limited availability.</p>

<p>The post outlines the qualities and skills desired in potential maintainers. Ideal candidates should have a strong understanding of Caddy's architecture, be proficient in Go (the programming language Caddy is written in), possess excellent communication skills, and be active members of the Caddy community. Experience in maintaining open-source projects is also highly valued.</p>

<p>The maintainer role is described as requiring a significant time commitment and a deep understanding of the project's goals and principles. Maintainers are expected to be responsive to the community, fair in their decisions, and committed to upholding Caddy's quality standards.</p>

<p>The process for becoming a maintainer is not explicitly defined in the announcement but would likely involve demonstrating a consistent track record of contributions to the project, active participation in the community, and alignment with the project's vision. The selection process would likely be collaborative, involving Matt Holt and potentially other existing contributors.</p>

<p>The announcement serves as a call to action for experienced Caddy users and developers who are passionate about the project and willing to dedicate their time and expertise to its continued development. The addition of new maintainers is seen as essential for Caddy to reach its full potential and remain a leading web server and reverse proxy solution.</p>

<p>The post encourages interested individuals to step forward and express their interest in becoming a maintainer. This is an opportunity to take on a leadership role in a popular open-source project and make a significant contribution to the web server community.</p>
