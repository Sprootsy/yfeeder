    The author, "Benjie," creates a series of Olympic events tailored for humanoid robots, each revealing the current limitations and challenges in the field. These events include the "100m Dash," where robots struggle with balance and speed; the "Weightlifting" competition, highlighting the difficulty robots face in handling variable and unstable loads; the "Gymnastics" event, showcasing the lack of grace and fluidity in robotic movements; the "Marathon," which exposes the energy inefficiency and maintenance requirements of current humanoid robots; the "High Jump," demonstrating the challenges in achieving dynamic and precise movements; the "Swimming" event, where robots contend with waterproofing and hydrodynamic design issues; the "Equestrian" event, humorously pairing robots with unpredictable biological partners; the "Synchronized Swimming" event, further emphasizing the difficulty of coordinated and fluid motion; and the "Figure Skating" event, which underscores the limitations in robotic artistry and adaptability.
