    <h2>Airlines are charging solo passengers higher fares than groups</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>The article discusses a potential issue where airlines might be charging solo travelers more for flights compared to those booking for two or more people. This practice, if true, is not transparent and could be considered discriminatory towards solo travelers. The author highlights anecdotal evidence and social media discussions where individuals have noticed price discrepancies when searching for single tickets versus multiple tickets for the same flight. The author conducted their own experiments to compare prices and found instances where booking for one person was indeed more expensive than booking for two. While airlines haven't explicitly confirmed this pricing strategy, possible explanations include algorithms optimizing for higher revenue based on booking patterns, or the assumption that groups tend to spend more on ancillary services. The author suggests that travelers should be aware of this potential pricing tactic and advises trying different booking scenarios (e.g., searching for one ticket versus two, even when traveling solo) to find the best possible fare. The article emphasizes the importance of transparency in airline pricing and raises concerns about the fairness of potentially penalizing solo travelers.</p>
