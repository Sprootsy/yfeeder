<p>According to the article, Apple has demanded that the EU repeal the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Apple argues that the DMA poses unacceptable risks to user privacy and data security. They claim that the DMA's requirements force them to degrade security protections and make harmful changes to core functionalities, impacting users globally, not just in the EU. Apple contends that the DMAâ€™s mandated interoperability and sideloading requirements open the door to malware, privacy breaches, and a fragmented user experience. Apple also claims that the DMA hinders their ability to innovate and differentiate their products.</p>
