  <p>The article "Stop Talking to Technology Executives Like They Have Anything to Say" critiques the tendency to treat technology executives as profound thinkers and visionaries, arguing that their pronouncements are often vapid, self-serving, and ultimately unhelpful. The author contends that technology executives, driven by profit motives and insulated from genuine societal concerns, are ill-equipped to offer meaningful insights on complex issues. Their statements are frequently filled with buzzwords and platitudes, lacking substance and genuine understanding. The article suggests that the media and public should critically assess the words of these executives, recognizing that their primary goal is to promote their companies and maintain a positive image, rather than contribute to thoughtful discourse. The author encourages people to seek wisdom and guidance from more credible sources, such as academics, researchers, and activists, who possess a deeper understanding of the challenges facing society.</p>
