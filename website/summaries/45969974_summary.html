<p>Former President Donald Trump is suing NPR and its former senior business editor, Uri Berliner, for defamation. The lawsuit, filed in Florida, alleges that NPR and Berliner falsely portrayed Trump as a racist. This stems from an essay Berliner wrote criticizing NPR's perceived liberal bias and its coverage of Trump. Trump claims that Berliner's statements, which NPR allegedly amplified, damaged his reputation.</p>

<p>The lawsuit targets an essay Berliner published where he claimed NPR lacked viewpoint diversity and exhibited bias in its coverage of various topics, including Trump. Trump's legal team argues that Berliner's assertions, particularly those implying Trump is racist, are demonstrably false and were made with malicious intent or reckless disregard for the truth. The suit claims NPR gave Berliner's opinions a broader platform, thereby exacerbating the alleged harm to Trump.</p>

<p>Berliner resigned from NPR shortly after his essay was published. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and a jury trial.</p>
