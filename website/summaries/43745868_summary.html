        <h1>Find the Odd Disk</h1>
        <p>Okay, here&#39;s a summary of the article you linked, adhering strictly to the content presented on that webpage:

**Summary:**

The article presents &#34;colors2,&#34; a color palette generator created by Alessandro Roussel. It&#39;s described as a tool for generating harmonious color palettes, inspired by the principles of Johannes Itten&#39;s color theory. The core of the tool is an interactive color wheel that allows users to explore color relationships and create palettes based on different color harmonies.

The website emphasizes the importance of understanding color relationships in design, referencing Itten&#39;s work on color contrasts and harmonies. Itten identified seven distinct types of color contrast, including contrast by saturation, contrast by hue, light-dark contrast, cold-warm contrast, complementary contrast, simultaneous contrast and contrast by extension. It is claimed that colors2 helps users create palettes based on these principles.

The application itself is a visual and interactive tool. Users can manipulate points on the color wheel to select base colors. Based on the base colors, the tool automatically generates color palettes according to different color harmonies (monochromatic, analogous, complementary, split complementary, triadic, and tetradic). The user can then fine-tune the generated palettes by adjusting individual colors, lightness, and saturation.

The interface displays the generated color palette with each color&#39;s hexadecimal code. It also offers options to adjust the size of the preview swatches and to view the palette in different color spaces (like sRGB or HSL). The tool also provides a &#34;lock&#34; functionality, allowing users to fix certain colors in the palette while exploring variations of the other colors. Users can &#34;lock&#34; colors they like and explore variations of the unlocked colors. The website does not require login or payment, and all code is available on Github.
