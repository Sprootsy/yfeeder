<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Blender 5.0 is a major release that focuses on core improvements, quality of life enhancements, and laying the groundwork for future development. It includes significant upgrades to core systems like Cycles, EEVEE, geometry processing, and the user interface.  One major goal of this release was to modernize and refactor the codebase, making it more maintainable and robust for future development efforts.</p>

<p><b>Cycles</b> sees improvements in performance, memory usage, and features.  Notably, the introduction of Light Linking allows for selective lighting of objects, offering finer control over scene illumination. The implementation of cached shadow maps boosts rendering speed in many scenes, especially those with complex lighting. Shadow caustics are more accurate and faster. There are also changes in how volumes are handled, impacting rendering times in some cases.  The Cycles code has been updated to be more future-proof, paving the way for further advancements.</p>

<p><b>EEVEE</b> also receives improvements, including a new "Render Passes" system which matches the one used by Cycles, allowing for compositing operations. There's increased consistency between EEVEE and Cycles, particularly in shadow handling and material properties. This aims to streamline the workflow for artists who switch between the two render engines.</p>

<p><b>Geometry Nodes</b> have been enhanced with new nodes and functionalities. A new simulation system provides greater flexibility for procedural animation and effects, including better control over particle systems and simulations. The release focuses on making Geometry Nodes more user-friendly and capable of handling complex tasks. There are many workflow improvements.</p>

<p>The <b>User Interface</b> benefits from several refinements, improving workflow and usability. These changes include a more streamlined "Add" menu, improved search functionality, and more intuitive options for customizing the interface. The goal is to make Blender more accessible and efficient for users of all skill levels.</p>

<p><b>Python API</b> has been improved, including improvements for type hinting and changes to function and class definitions, and will require some add-ons to be updated.</p>

<p><b>USD (Universal Scene Description)</b> receives updates to its integration. This is important for interoperability with other DCC (Digital Content Creation) tools and pipelines.</p>

<p>Many smaller features, bug fixes, and performance improvements across various modules further contribute to the overall stability and efficiency of Blender 5.0. This release represents a significant step forward in Blender's evolution, focusing on core strengths and preparing the software for future innovations.</p>
