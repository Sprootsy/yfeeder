    The article, titled "Jank is C++," announces a significant shift in the development of the Jank programming language. Initially envisioned as a unique, memory-safe language, the Jank team has decided to reimplement Jank using C++ as its core foundation. This decision stems from a pragmatic assessment of the challenges and trade-offs involved in building a new language and ecosystem from scratch.
  </p>
  <p>
    The primary motivation behind this change is to leverage the mature C++ ecosystem, including its extensive libraries, tooling, and compiler infrastructure. Building a compiler and standard library is a substantial undertaking, and the team recognized that reimplementing these components in C++ would allow them to focus on Jank's unique features and value proposition, rather than reinventing the wheel. The reliance on the existing C++ infrastructure will enable faster development and allow the team to concentrate on language-specific features.
  </p>
  <p>
    Memory safety, a key goal of the original Jank design, remains a priority. The team plans to achieve this through a combination of techniques, including static analysis, runtime checks, and careful API design within the C++ implementation. They aim to provide a high level of memory safety without sacrificing performance. They will use modern C++ features and libraries to help ensure memory safety.
  </p>
  <p>
    The transition to C++ will impact the language's feature set. Some features initially planned for Jank, such as advanced type systems or novel concurrency models, may be deferred or re-evaluated in light of the new implementation strategy. However, the core design principles of Jank, such as simplicity, expressiveness, and performance, will remain central to the language's evolution.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article also addresses concerns about potential performance overhead introduced by the C++ layer. The team acknowledges that there may be some performance trade-offs, but they believe that the benefits of leveraging the C++ ecosystem outweigh the drawbacks. They plan to optimize the C++ implementation to minimize any performance impact and to ensure that Jank remains competitive with other high-performance languages. Furthermore, they plan on making it possible to seamlessly use C++ code from Jank and vice versa.
  </p>

    The author emphasizes that this change is not a sign of failure but rather a strategic pivot to accelerate development and increase the likelihood of Jank's long-term success. By building on the foundation of C++, the Jank team hopes to create a language that is both powerful and practical, with a vibrant ecosystem and a strong community. The author seems optimistic about the future of Jank, despite the change.
