The article analyzes the internal construction of several recalled portable power banks using industrial CT scanning to identify potential design and manufacturing flaws that could lead to overheating and fire hazards. The power banks examined were models that had been recalled due to these safety concerns.

Luma Labs conducted detailed 3D scans of the power banks, looking at aspects like battery cell placement, thermal management features (or lack thereof), and the quality of soldering and connections. The analysis reveals several recurring issues across different brands and models. One common problem is the inadequate spacing or physical protection of the battery cells. In some cases, cells were packed too tightly together without sufficient insulation or spacing, increasing the risk of thermal runaway if one cell were to overheat. Another issue was poor thermal management in general, with some power banks lacking heat sinks or other mechanisms to dissipate heat effectively.

The quality of the soldering and connections within the power banks was also inconsistent. Some units showed signs of poor soldering, which can lead to increased resistance and localized heating. Additionally, the physical construction often lacked robustness. Components were sometimes poorly secured, which can lead to movement and potential short circuits during use or transport. The article highlights that cost-cutting measures in design and manufacturing appear to be a significant contributing factor to these flaws. By using cheaper materials, simplifying designs, and implementing less stringent quality control, manufacturers increase the risk of product failure and potential safety hazards.

The investigation underscores the importance of rigorous testing and quality control in the production of portable power banks. It emphasizes that manufacturers need to prioritize safety over cost savings to prevent recalls and protect consumers from potential harm. The analysis also showcases the value of using advanced imaging techniques like CT scanning to identify hidden flaws in electronic devices and improve product safety.
