    <h2>Orders of Infinity</h2>

<p>This blog post by Terry Tao on his WordPress blog, dated May 4, 2025, discusses different ways to compare the "size" or "order of infinity" of sets, primarily focusing on infinite sets. The central theme revolves around the concept that not all infinities are equal and that there exist different levels or orders of infinity.</p>

<p>Tao starts by revisiting the familiar territory of finite sets, where comparing sizes is straightforward: a set with more elements is considered larger. However, this simple comparison breaks down when dealing with infinite sets. He introduces the crucial concept of <em>equinumerosity</em> (or equipotency), which means two sets have the same cardinality (size) if there exists a bijection (a one-to-one and onto mapping) between them. This notion is fundamental for comparing infinite sets.</p>

<p>The post highlights Cantor's groundbreaking discovery that the set of natural numbers (ℕ) and the set of real numbers (ℝ) are not equinumerous. Cantor proved that the cardinality of ℝ is strictly greater than the cardinality of ℕ. This is demonstrated through Cantor's diagonal argument, a powerful technique showing that no matter how you try to map the natural numbers to the real numbers, you'll always be able to construct a real number that's not in your mapping.</p>

<p>Tao then delves into the concept of countable and uncountable sets. A set is <em>countable</em> if it is finite or equinumerous with the set of natural numbers (i.e., its elements can be listed in a sequence). The set of integers (ℤ) and the set of rational numbers (ℚ) are shown to be countable, despite appearing "larger" than ℕ at first glance. This is demonstrated by constructing bijections between these sets and ℕ.</p>

<p>In contrast, the set of real numbers (ℝ) and the power set of the natural numbers (P(ℕ), the set of all subsets of ℕ) are <em>uncountable</em>. Their cardinality is strictly greater than that of ℕ. The cardinality of ℕ is often denoted by ℵ₀ (aleph-null), while the cardinality of ℝ and P(ℕ) is denoted by 2<sup>ℵ₀</sup>, also known as the cardinality of the continuum. Cantor's diagonal argument proves the uncountability of ℝ, and a separate argument (often involving representing real numbers in binary) demonstrates the equinumerosity of ℝ and P(ℕ).</p>

<p>The post touches upon Cantor's theorem, which generalizes the idea that the power set of any set always has a strictly greater cardinality than the set itself. In other words, for any set A, the cardinality of P(A) is always greater than the cardinality of A. This leads to a hierarchy of infinities: ℵ₀ &lt; 2<sup>ℵ₀</sup> &lt; 2<sup>2<sup>ℵ₀</sup></sup>, and so on, demonstrating that there's no "largest" infinity.</p>

<p>The Continuum Hypothesis is mentioned briefly. This hypothesis states that there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the natural numbers (ℵ₀) and the real numbers (2<sup>ℵ₀</sup>). In other words, 2<sup>ℵ₀</sup> is the next cardinal number after ℵ₀, denoted as ℵ₁. The Continuum Hypothesis is independent of the standard axioms of set theory (ZFC), meaning it can neither be proved nor disproved within ZFC.</p>

<p>The post concludes by emphasizing the profound implications of these concepts for understanding the nature of infinity and the richness of set theory. It highlights how the seemingly simple question of "how many" can lead to deep and surprising results when dealing with infinite sets.</p>

<h3>Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Equinumerosity:</b> Two sets have the same "size" if there's a bijection between them. This is the fundamental way to compare infinite sets.</li>
<li><b>Countable vs. Uncountable:</b> A set is countable if it's finite or equinumerous with the natural numbers. Otherwise, it's uncountable.</li>
<li><b>Cantor's Diagonal Argument:</b> Proves that the real numbers (ℝ) are uncountable, having a larger cardinality than the natural numbers (ℕ).</li>
<li><b>Cardinality of the Continuum:</b> The cardinality of ℝ (and the power set of ℕ) is denoted by 2<sup>ℵ₀</sup>.</li>
<li><b>Cantor's Theorem:</b> The power set of any set has a strictly greater cardinality than the set itself.</div>
