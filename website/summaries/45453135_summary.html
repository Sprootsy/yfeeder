  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
   Fastmail's blog post "Not Written With AI" discusses the company's deliberate choice not to use AI in creating content for their users. They believe in the value of human-generated content, emphasizing that their blog posts, help articles, and other communications are written by people, for people.

  <p>
   The core argument revolves around the importance of trust and authenticity. Fastmail believes that AI-generated content, while potentially efficient, lacks the nuance, personal experience, and genuine understanding that human writers can bring. They are concerned that AI-written text can often sound generic, repetitive, or even nonsensical in certain contexts. Fastmail emphasizes that their users rely on them for accurate, reliable, and helpful information, and they believe that human writers are better equipped to deliver this.

   The post also highlights the unique perspective and personality that human writers inject into their work. Fastmail believes this human touch makes their content more engaging and relatable. They value the ability of their writers to draw upon their own experiences, insights, and empathy to create content that truly resonates with their audience.

   Fastmail acknowledges the potential benefits of AI in other areas, but firmly states that they will continue to prioritize human-generated content for user-facing materials. They view this as a commitment to quality, accuracy, and the preservation of the human element in their communication. They believe this approach fosters stronger relationships with their users, built on trust and the assurance that they are receiving information crafted by real people who understand their needs.

  <p>
   In essence, Fastmail positions its stance against AI-generated content as a dedication to providing a superior user experience through authentic, human-crafted communication. They see it as a key differentiator and a reflection of their values as a company.
