 <h3>Summary:</h3>
 <p>
 The article, "You Sent the Message, But Did You Communicate?", discusses the difference between merely transmitting information and actually achieving effective communication. It emphasizes that sending a message is only the first step, and true communication requires ensuring the message is received, understood, and elicits the intended response.
 </p>
 <p>
 The author posits that many communication breakdowns occur because individuals focus solely on their role as senders, neglecting the crucial aspects of the receiver's understanding and interpretation. The article highlights several factors that can impede effective communication. One significant barrier is the assumption that others share the same background, knowledge, or perspective as the sender. This can lead to the use of jargon, technical terms, or culturally specific references that the receiver may not comprehend.
 </p>
 <p>
 Another point raised is the importance of considering the receiver's state of mind and emotional condition. A message delivered when the receiver is distracted, stressed, or preoccupied is less likely to be fully processed and understood. Similarly, the medium used to convey the message plays a vital role. A complex or sensitive message may be better delivered in person or via a phone call, allowing for immediate clarification and feedback, whereas a quick update might be suitable for an email or text message.
 </p>
 <p>
 The author stresses the need for active listening and seeking feedback to confirm understanding. Asking clarifying questions, paraphrasing the message to ensure accuracy, and observing non-verbal cues are all presented as strategies for gauging the receiver's comprehension. Furthermore, the article advocates for tailoring the message to the specific audience. This involves considering their level of knowledge, their interests, and their preferred communication style.
 </p>
 <p>
 The piece also touches on the role of trust and rapport in effective communication. When there is a strong foundation of trust and mutual respect, messages are more likely to be received openly and interpreted accurately. Conversely, if there is a lack of trust or a history of misunderstandings, the receiver may be more skeptical or defensive, hindering the communication process.
 </p>
 <p>
 Finally, the article underscores that communication is a two-way street, requiring both the sender and the receiver to actively participate and take responsibility for ensuring mutual understanding. It encourages readers to shift their focus from simply sending messages to actively facilitating communication, emphasizing that the goal is not just to transmit information but to create shared meaning and understanding. This involves being mindful of the receiver's perspective, seeking feedback, and adapting one's communication style to maximize clarity and impact.
