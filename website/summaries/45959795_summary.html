  <p>According to Windows Latest, Microsoft is planning to integrate an AI agent directly into Windows 11. This AI agent, codenamed "personified AI," is designed to run in the background and will have access to personal folders and data. The report suggests that this level of access raises significant privacy and security concerns. The AI is expected to be deeply integrated into the operating system and could potentially manage tasks and provide assistance based on user data. Concerns have been raised about how Microsoft will handle user privacy, the potential for misuse of personal data, and the security risks associated with granting an AI agent such extensive access to sensitive information. The specifics of how the AI agent will function and the exact extent of its access are still unclear, but the report highlights the potential implications for Windows 11 users.</p>
