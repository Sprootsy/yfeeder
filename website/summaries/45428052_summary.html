<p>The article is a personal essay by a freelance writer who reflects on the increasing capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) in content creation and its potential impact on her livelihood. She begins by humorously noting her reliance on em-dashes and how AI might soon master even that stylistic quirk. She acknowledges AI's growing ability to generate coherent and grammatically correct text, which was previously considered a uniquely human skill. The writer expresses concern that as AI becomes more sophisticated and cheaper to use, businesses may opt for AI-generated content over hiring human writers, thus threatening her job security. She highlights the value of human creativity, critical thinking, and personal experiences in writing, which she believes are still superior to AI-generated content. However, she also acknowledges that AI is improving rapidly and may eventually surpass human writers in certain areas. The writer grapples with the uncertainty and anxiety surrounding the future of her profession in the age of AI, questioning whether her skills will remain valuable and whether she will be able to adapt to the changing landscape.</p>
