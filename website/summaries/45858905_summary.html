  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The provided URL directs to the official website for Marko, a modern and lightweight JavaScript framework developed by eBay for building user interfaces. The site highlights Marko's key features, benefits, and use cases, primarily focusing on its server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities, component-based architecture, and performance optimizations. Marko aims to provide a streamlined development experience and efficient runtime performance for web applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Marko emphasizes its ability to render HTML on the server, enabling faster initial page loads and improved SEO. This is achieved through techniques like streaming rendering, where the server sends HTML chunks to the browser as they are generated, rather than waiting for the entire page to be ready. The framework also supports progressive rendering, which allows the browser to display content as it becomes available, further enhancing the user experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    The component-based architecture of Marko promotes code reusability and maintainability. Components encapsulate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript logic, making it easier to build complex UIs from smaller, independent parts. Marko's syntax is designed to be familiar to web developers, blending HTML with JavaScript expressions and directives for dynamic content generation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Performance is a central theme throughout the Marko website. The framework employs various optimization strategies to minimize JavaScript bundle sizes, reduce memory consumption, and improve rendering speed. Key features contributing to performance include its efficient DOM diffing algorithm, which minimizes the amount of DOM manipulation required to update the UI, and its ability to compile templates into highly optimized JavaScript code. Marko also supports features like code splitting and lazy loading to further optimize application performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The site also highlights Marko's features such as custom tags, which allow developers to extend the HTML vocabulary with reusable UI elements, and its support for various JavaScript tools and libraries. The website likely showcases success stories and case studies of companies using Marko in production, demonstrating its scalability and reliability.
  </p>
  <p>
    In essence, the Marko website positions the framework as a compelling solution for developers seeking to build high-performance, server-rendered web applications with a focus on developer experience and maintainability. It highlights features like streaming rendering, component architecture, and performance optimizations, showcasing Marko's capabilities in addressing common challenges in modern web development. The website serves as a central resource for learning about Marko, exploring its features, and getting started with building applications.
