   <h2>Summary:</h2>
   <p>
     The Zed editor has announced a change to its pricing model for LLM (Large Language Model) usage, moving from a per-user, per-month flat rate to a token-based consumption model. Previously, Zed offered unlimited LLM usage for $25 per user per month. However, due to the high costs associated with running LLMs, particularly with the increasing demand and generous usage by users, the previous model was unsustainable.
   </p>
   <p>
     The new token-based system aims to align costs more closely with actual usage. Users will now be charged based on the number of tokens processed by the LLM. The announcement emphasizes that this change is necessary to ensure the long-term viability of offering LLM features within Zed. The new pricing takes effect on June 1, 2024.
   </p>
   <p>
     Zed assures users that they are committed to providing a transparent and predictable pricing structure. Users will be able to monitor their LLM usage and associated costs through a dashboard. They also state that they will provide tools and guidance to help users optimize their usage and manage their spending.
   </p>
   <p>
     The blog post also highlights Zed's intention to remain competitive and offer more affordable LLM usage compared to other services. They will achieve this through techniques such as model optimization and caching. Users who do not use LLM features will not be affected by this pricing change.
   </p>
   <p>
     Furthermore, Zed plans to introduce a system that enables users to bring their own API keys from LLM providers, giving them even greater control over pricing and model selection. This feature is expected to be available in the future.
