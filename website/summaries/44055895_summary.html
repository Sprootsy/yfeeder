    This GitHub repository hosts the Advanced Code Engine (ACE) for RISC-V, an open-source project developed by IBM. ACE is designed to facilitate the development of high-performance computing (HPC) applications on RISC-V architectures. It provides optimized libraries and tools that target key HPC workloads, aiming to improve performance, energy efficiency, and scalability.
  </p>
  <p>
    The repository includes several components, such as optimized mathematical libraries (e.g., BLAS, LAPACK), communication libraries (e.g., MPI), and tools for performance analysis and tuning.  These components are specifically tailored for RISC-V processors and are designed to take advantage of the unique features and capabilities of the architecture. The goal is to enable researchers, developers, and users to effectively leverage RISC-V in demanding computational environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project emphasizes portability and interoperability, ensuring that applications developed with ACE can be easily deployed across different RISC-V platforms. It also promotes collaboration and community involvement, encouraging contributions and feedback from the open-source community to continuously improve the software stack. By providing a robust and optimized software infrastructure, ACE aims to accelerate the adoption of RISC-V in the HPC domain and foster innovation in RISC-V-based computing solutions.
