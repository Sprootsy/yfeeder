<p>According to an article by Micah Lee, TeleMessage, an Israeli messaging company, whose services were used by Trump administration officials, can access plaintext chat logs despite misleading marketing claims. The article investigates TeleMessage's capabilities and security practices, based on the company's marketing materials, a security review by researchers at Cure53, and statements from the company itself.</p>
<p>TeleMessage offers various messaging solutions, including archiving services that capture and store communications for regulatory compliance. It markets its services as secure and compliant with regulations such as SEC 17a-4 and FINRA, implying a high level of security and data protection. However, the article raises concerns about the company's ability to access and potentially expose the content of supposedly private messages.</p>
<p>The Cure53 security review, commissioned by TeleMessage, revealed vulnerabilities in the company's systems. While TeleMessage addressed some of these issues, the report indicated potential access to unencrypted message data. Specifically, the review highlighted that TeleMessage's archiving solutions could technically allow the company to access plaintext messages, even if end-to-end encryption was used during transmission.</p>
<p>The article emphasizes that TeleMessage's marketing materials may be misleading by suggesting a level of security that doesn't fully reflect the company's capabilities. While the company offers encryption features, the archiving process could bypass these protections, allowing TeleMessage and potentially unauthorized individuals to view message content.</p>
<p>The use of TeleMessage by Trump administration officials, particularly for communications related to official business, raises concerns about compliance with record-keeping laws. If messages were not properly archived or if the company's security practices were inadequate, it could lead to violations of regulations such as the Presidential Records Act.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the article suggests that TeleMessage's claims of security and compliance should be viewed with skepticism. Despite offering encryption, the company's archiving capabilities and potential vulnerabilities could allow access to plaintext message data, posing risks to privacy and regulatory compliance.</p>
