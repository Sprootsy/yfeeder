 <h2>Summary</h2>
 <p>The article discusses Meta's substantial expenditure of $14 billion annually on recruitment, benefits, and stock-based compensation for its approximately 70,000 employees. This figure translates to an average cost of $200,000 per employee, excluding base salary. The author argues that while this level of investment might be justifiable for a company aiming to lead in cutting-edge technological advancements, it raises questions regarding Meta's current priorities and strategic direction. The company's focus on the Metaverse, despite its uncertain future and profitability, is contrasted with potentially more promising areas like AI, where the author believes Meta is lagging behind competitors like Google and Microsoft.</p>
