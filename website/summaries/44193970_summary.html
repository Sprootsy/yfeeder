A recent study has revealed that millions of people in Western countries are unaware that they have aggressive fatty liver disease, also known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). This condition, a more severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), can lead to liver scarring, cirrhosis, liver cancer, and cardiovascular issues if left untreated.

The study highlights that MASH often progresses silently, with many individuals experiencing no noticeable symptoms until the advanced stages of the disease. This lack of awareness poses a significant public health challenge, as early detection and intervention are crucial for preventing serious complications. Risk factors for MASH include obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and abnormal blood lipid levels.

Researchers emphasize the need for increased screening and diagnostic efforts to identify individuals at risk for MASH. They also advocate for lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, as primary strategies for managing and potentially reversing the disease in its early stages. The study underscores the importance of raising awareness among both healthcare professionals and the general public about the prevalence and potential severity of MASH.
