   <h2>Summary:</h2>
   <p>The article, published in The New York Times on May 14, 2025, discusses the evolving role of radiologists in the age of artificial intelligence, focusing on a case study at the Mayo Clinic. It explores how AI is being integrated into radiology workflows and its impact on the profession. While some initially feared that AI would replace radiologists, the article highlights a different reality: AI is augmenting their work, improving efficiency, and potentially enhancing diagnostic accuracy. The piece centers on Dr. Erik Weber, a radiologist at the Mayo Clinic, and how his daily tasks have changed with the implementation of AI tools. Specifically, AI is assisting in detecting subtle anomalies in medical images that might be missed by the human eye, as well as automating mundane tasks. This enables radiologists to focus on more complex cases and spend more time consulting with patients and other doctors. The article points out that the integration of AI is not without challenges. There are concerns about the cost of implementing and maintaining these AI systems, as well as the need for ongoing training for radiologists to effectively use the new technology. Data privacy and security are also crucial considerations. However, the overall tone of the article is optimistic. It suggests that AI is not a replacement for radiologists but rather a powerful tool that can help them provide better care. The story emphasizes the collaboration between humans and machines, with AI handling the repetitive and time-consuming aspects of the job, while radiologists leverage their expertise and clinical judgment to make final diagnoses. The example of the Mayo Clinic demonstrates a proactive approach to embracing AI, with the institution investing in research and development to integrate AI tools seamlessly into its radiology department.</p>
