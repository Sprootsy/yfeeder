  <p>The article discusses a newly discovered connection between the mathematical concept of infinity and theoretical computer science, specifically relating to the field of program verification. Mathematicians have long explored different sizes of infinity, a concept formalized by Georg Cantor in the 19th century. Cantor demonstrated that not all infinities are equal, with the set of real numbers being a "larger" infinity than the set of natural numbers. This hierarchy of infinities, characterized by cardinal numbers, has intrigued mathematicians for generations.</p>
  <p>Recently, researchers have found an unexpected link between these cardinal numbers and the complexity of program verification. Program verification is the process of formally proving that a computer program will behave as intended under all possible circumstances, a notoriously difficult problem. The article highlights the work of Boris Tsirelson, a physicist who explored non-locality in quantum mechanics, and his connection to the continuum hypothesis, which deals with the size of infinity between the natural numbers and real numbers. The independence of the continuum hypothesis from the standard axioms of set theory (ZFC) means it can neither be proven nor disproven within that system.</p>
  <p>The new research demonstrates that certain program verification problems require axioms beyond ZFC to be resolved. Specifically, the complexity of verifying certain programs is linked to the cardinal numbers that characterize different sizes of infinity. This connection reveals that the hierarchy of infinities, previously considered abstract and purely mathematical, has concrete implications for computer science.</p>
  <p>The researchers show that the difficulty of verifying programs can increase dramatically depending on which axioms, related to the sizes of infinity, are assumed. Some program verification problems are solvable using only the standard axioms of set theory, while others require additional axioms that specify the relationships between different cardinal numbers. This suggests that the limits of what computers can be proven to do are fundamentally tied to the nature of infinity itself.</p>
  <p>This discovery has several implications. It provides a new perspective on the limits of computation and formal verification. It also suggests that tools and techniques from set theory and the study of infinity could be applied to tackle challenging problems in computer science. Furthermore, it highlights the deep and often surprising connections between seemingly disparate areas of mathematics and computer science.</p>
  <p>In summary, the article describes a groundbreaking link between the abstract mathematical concept of different sizes of infinity and the practical problem of program verification in computer science. This connection reveals that the complexity of verifying computer programs is fundamentally tied to the hierarchy of infinities, suggesting new avenues for research and a deeper understanding of the limits of computation.</p>
