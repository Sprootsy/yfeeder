Noem stated on social media that she was sending the South Dakota National Guard to Los Angeles, prompting swift backlash. Padilla described Noem's statement as dangerous and irresponsible, accusing her of trying to incite violence and fear. He emphasized that decisions about law enforcement and public safety in California are the responsibility of California authorities.
