    <h2>Show HN: VectorVFS, your filesystem as a vector database</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p>VectorVFS is a Python package designed to provide a unified file system interface that abstracts away the underlying storage mechanisms. It allows developers to interact with various storage systems, such as local file systems, cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage), and even in-memory storage, using a consistent API. This abstraction simplifies file system operations and enables seamless switching between different storage backends without modifying application code.</p>

<p>The library is built around the concept of a "Virtual File System" (VFS), which is a hierarchical namespace that maps logical paths to physical storage locations. The VFS is composed of one or more "mounts," each representing a specific storage backend. Each mount is associated with a root path within the VFS, and all operations performed on paths within that subtree are routed to the corresponding backend.</p>

<p>VectorVFS supports a wide range of file system operations, including creating, reading, writing, deleting, and listing files and directories. It also provides utilities for managing metadata, such as file sizes, timestamps, and permissions. The library is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to create custom storage backends to support specific storage systems or requirements.</p>

<p>Key features of VectorVFS include:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Unified API:</b> Provides a consistent interface for interacting with different storage backends.</li>
<li><b>Abstraction:</b> Hides the complexities of underlying storage systems, simplifying file system operations.</li>
<li><b>Extensibility:</b> Allows developers to create custom storage backends.</li>
<li><b>Mount Points:</b> Enables mapping logical paths to specific storage locations.</li>
<li><b>Metadata Management:</b> Provides utilities for managing file and directory metadata.</li>
<li><b>Support for Multiple Storage Backends:</b> Includes built-in support for local file systems, cloud storage (S3, GCS), and in-memory storage.</li>
<li><b>Thread Safety:</b> Designed to be thread-safe, allowing concurrent access to the VFS from multiple threads.</li>
<li><b>Path Manipulation Utilities:</b> Offers tools for working with file paths, such as joining, splitting, and normalizing paths.</li>
<li><b>Error Handling:</b> Provides a consistent error handling mechanism for dealing with file system errors.</li>
</ul>

<p>VectorVFS aims to simplify file system management in applications by providing a flexible and extensible abstraction layer. It promotes code reusability, reduces dependencies on specific storage systems, and facilitates testing and deployment in different environments.</p>
