  <p>This article, titled "Live birth rates after frozen embryo transfer are similar using artificial intelligence-based and conventional embryo selection: a multicenter randomized controlled trial," published in Human Reproduction, investigates whether the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for embryo selection in frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycles improves live birth rates compared to conventional morphological assessment. The study is a multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted across multiple fertility clinics.</p>
  <p>The study addresses the growing interest in AI applications within assisted reproductive technology (ART), specifically for embryo selection. Selecting the embryo with the highest implantation potential is crucial for the success of in vitro fertilization (IVF). Traditional embryo selection relies on morphological assessment by embryologists, which can be subjective. AI-based systems offer the potential for more objective and standardized assessment of embryo quality, potentially improving outcomes.</p>
  <p>The researchers randomly assigned patients undergoing FET to either AI-based embryo selection or conventional morphological assessment. In the AI group, an AI algorithm was used to rank embryos based on their predicted implantation potential. In the conventional assessment group, embryologists selected embryos based on standard morphological criteria. The primary outcome was live birth rate.</p>
  <p>The authors hypothesized that AI-based embryo selection would result in a higher live birth rate compared to conventional morphological assessment. The trial was designed to rigorously test this hypothesis through randomization and a well-defined primary endpoint.</p>
  <p>The results of the study indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in live birth rates between the AI-based embryo selection group and the conventional morphological assessment group. This suggests that, at least with the specific AI system used in the trial, AI-based selection did not offer a significant advantage over traditional methods for improving live birth rates in FET cycles.</p>
  <p>The article discusses the implications of these findings for the field of ART. While AI holds promise for improving various aspects of IVF, this study suggests that further research and development are needed to optimize AI-based embryo selection tools. The authors also emphasize the importance of rigorous clinical trials, like this RCT, to evaluate the effectiveness of new technologies before they are widely adopted in clinical practice.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, the study provides evidence that, in the context of FET, AI-based embryo selection, as implemented in this trial, does not significantly improve live birth rates compared to conventional morphological assessment. This finding contributes to the ongoing evaluation of AI applications in ART and highlights the need for continued research and validation.</p>
