    <h2>Proposed NOAA Budget Kills Program Designed to Prevent Satellite Collisions</h2>

<p>The article discusses concerns within the astronomical community regarding proposed cuts to NOAA's budget that would eliminate the Space Weather Follow-On (SWFO) program, specifically the Lagrange 1 (L1) mission. This mission is designed to monitor space weather conditions and provide critical data for predicting and mitigating potential disruptions to satellites and other space-based infrastructure.</p>

<p>The SWFO-L1 mission is intended to replace the aging Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite, which currently provides crucial information about solar activity. The data from ACE allows operators to take preventative measures to avoid satellite collisions and protect them from damage caused by solar flares and coronal mass ejections. Without a successor like SWFO-L1, there's a significant risk of losing this capability, which could lead to increased satellite failures and disruptions to services that rely on space-based technology.</p>

<p>The article highlights the growing problem of space debris and the increasing number of satellites in orbit, which has heightened the risk of collisions. The loss of space weather monitoring capabilities would severely hamper efforts to avoid these collisions. The astronomical community, including organizations like the American Astronomical Society (AAS), is concerned about the potential consequences of this budget cut, emphasizing the importance of space weather forecasting for protecting both governmental and commercial space assets.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the article notes that the decision to eliminate the SWFO-L1 mission appears to contradict previous congressional mandates and funding allocations aimed at improving space weather forecasting capabilities. The proposed budget cut has raised questions about the government's commitment to protecting its space infrastructure and ensuring the continued operation of vital satellite services. It also could impact the new generation of telescopes on Earth. Geomagnetic storms cause fluctuations in Earth's ionosphere, which distorts radio signals from space. The distortions make it difficult to get precise measurements of pulsars and other objects.</p>
