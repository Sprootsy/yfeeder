        <h1>Stuffed-Na(a)N: stuff your NaNs</h1>
        <p>
<div>
  <p>The GitHub repository si14/stuffed-naan-js is a project described as a JavaScript implementation of a "stuffed naan," with an emphasis on immutability and functional programming principles. While the name humorously alludes to a culinary dish, the repository appears to provide utilities and data structures designed for handling immutable data in JavaScript.</p>

  <p>Based on the available information, the project likely focuses on providing tools to manage data in a way that avoids direct modification of existing objects or arrays. Immutability is a key concept in functional programming and helps prevent unintended side effects, making code more predictable and easier to debug. The "stuffed naan" metaphor suggests a data structure that encapsulates and protects its contents (the "stuffing"), ensuring that changes create new instances rather than altering the original. Functional programming, another cornerstone of the project, emphasizes the use of pure functions (functions without side effects) and declarative programming styles, leading to more modular and testable code.</p>

  <p>Without specific code examples or detailed documentation, it's challenging to provide a precise breakdown of the repository's features. However, one could anticipate that it includes data structures like immutable lists, maps, or sets, along with functions for transforming and manipulating these structures. These functions would likely return new instances of the data structures, leaving the original data unchanged. Common operations might include adding elements, removing elements, filtering data, and mapping functions over collections, all while adhering to immutability constraints.</p>

  <p>The choice of JavaScript as the implementation language allows for the use of these immutable data structures and functional programming techniques within web browsers and Node.js environments. The repository might also leverage features of modern JavaScript, such as ES6+ syntax, to improve code readability and maintainability. The benefits of using such a library in a JavaScript project include improved data integrity, reduced risk of bugs caused by unexpected state changes, and enhanced support for concurrent or parallel programming paradigms.</p>

  <p>In summary, si14/stuffed-naan-js is a JavaScript library that implements immutable data structures and functional programming utilities. The project aims to provide developers with the tools to manage data in a predictable and safe manner, reducing the risk of side effects and improving code quality.</p>
