<h3>Summary:</h3>
The article is a personal reflection on the author's experiences with ultraviolet (UV) light and its impact on their health and awareness. Initially, UV light was a somewhat abstract concept, primarily associated with sunburns. However, the author's perspective shifted dramatically after developing Polymorphous Light Eruption (PMLE), a condition causing an allergic reaction to UV exposure.

The author recounts their early experiences with sunburns, noting a typical pattern of underestimating the sun's intensity and experiencing delayed reactions. This often involved being caught off guard by the sun's power, particularly in situations where exposure was incidental, like driving. These experiences contributed to a general sense of carelessness regarding sun protection.

The diagnosis of PMLE changed everything. The author describes the condition as a distressing experience, characterized by itchy rashes and a general feeling of being unwell after even brief sun exposure. This led to a significant lifestyle adjustment, including diligent sun protection measures like wearing long sleeves, hats, and sunscreen, and carefully planning outdoor activities to minimize UV exposure.

Beyond the physical impact, the author reflects on how PMLE has heightened their awareness of UV light as a pervasive environmental factor. They discuss the challenges of navigating a world not designed for UV-sensitive individuals, such as the difficulty of finding adequate shade and the constant need to be vigilant about potential exposure. The author also touches on the social implications of their condition, including the need to explain their sun-avoidance behavior to others.

The article delves into the complexities of UV light itself, discussing the different types of UV radiation (UVA, UVB, and UVC) and their varying effects on the skin. It touches upon the fact that UV light is present even on cloudy days and can penetrate certain materials, like windows.

Ultimately, the author expresses a sense of both frustration and acceptance regarding their condition. While PMLE has undoubtedly restricted their lifestyle, it has also led to a deeper understanding of the environment and the importance of protecting oneself from harmful UV radiation. They conclude by emphasizing the need for greater awareness and consideration of UV sensitivity, advocating for more shaded public spaces and a general shift in societal attitudes toward sun protection. The piece is a personal narrative interwoven with scientific information, highlighting the lived experience of dealing with a chronic sensitivity to UV light.
