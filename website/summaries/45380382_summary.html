  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Cloudflare has introduced Net Dollar, a new business model designed to support and foster growth on the AI-driven internet. This initiative aims to address the challenges faced by developers and operators of AI models and applications, specifically concerning the high costs associated with bandwidth and compute resources. Net Dollar allows AI innovators to pay only for the actual value derived from network usage, rather than being constrained by traditional bandwidth-based pricing models. This new model is designed to support the bandwidth-intensive nature of AI applications, enabling innovation without the burden of unpredictable or excessive costs.</p>
 

  <p>Cloudflare's Net Dollar seeks to revolutionize how AI applications are monetized and scaled. By aligning costs with the true utility gained from network resources, the platform aims to reduce the financial barriers to entry for AI startups and independent developers. This approach encourages more experimentation and deployment of AI solutions, as developers can more accurately predict and manage their operational expenses. The intention is to foster a more dynamic and accessible AI ecosystem, driving innovation and creating new opportunities across various industries.</p>
 

  <p>The Net Dollar initiative complements Cloudflare's existing suite of services, providing a comprehensive solution for AI developers. It enhances the value proposition of Cloudflare's AI platform, making it more attractive for businesses looking to build and deploy AI applications. By addressing the cost concerns associated with bandwidth, Cloudflare aims to stimulate further investment and participation in the AI space. This move reflects Cloudflare's commitment to supporting the evolving needs of the internet and its users, particularly in the context of rapidly advancing AI technologies.</p>
