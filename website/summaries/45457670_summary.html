     The author outlines several specific issues encountered, including seniors struggling with fundamental tasks like understanding the Home button, swiping, and the concept of apps. Many had trouble remembering instructions and frequently asked the same questions repeatedly. A significant obstacle was their unfamiliarity with touchscreen interfaces and the need for precise finger movements. Some seniors also had difficulty with vision and dexterity, making it harder to see small icons and perform gestures accurately.
