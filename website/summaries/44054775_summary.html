 <h2>Summary</h2>
 <p>
  The article delves into the fascinating story of Bhutan's innovative and unique playable record postage stamps, issued in the 1960s. These weren't just ordinary stamps; they were miniature vinyl records containing spoken words and music, showcasing Bhutanese culture and history. The idea originated with Burt Todd, an American entrepreneur who envisioned using new technologies to promote international understanding. He convinced the Bhutanese government, then under the leadership of King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, to embrace this novel concept.

  The first set of these stamps was released in 1964, featuring seven different designs. Each stamp played a message when placed on a record player. These messages ranged from a brief history of Bhutan to folk songs and even a lesson in Dzongkha, the national language. The stamps were a hit, capturing the imagination of collectors and the public alike. The initiative was seen as a clever way to promote Bhutan on a global scale and to highlight its unique cultural heritage.

  The technical aspects of creating these stamps were quite complex for the time. The records were very thin and fragile, requiring careful handling. The sound quality, while not comparable to regular vinyl records, was surprisingly clear given the miniature size. The stamps were produced in Japan, which possessed the necessary technology and expertise.

  Beyond their novelty, the playable stamps served a significant purpose. They helped to introduce Bhutan to the world during a period when the country was relatively isolated. They also helped to preserve and promote Bhutanese culture and language. The stamps became a symbol of Bhutan's willingness to embrace innovation while still cherishing its traditions.
