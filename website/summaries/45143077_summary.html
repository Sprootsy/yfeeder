  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
   The author reflects on their past engagement with online comment culture, particularly on news articles and social media platforms. They describe a past where they actively participated in commenting, driven by a desire to correct misinformation, offer alternative perspectives, and engage in debate. Over time, the author grew disillusioned with this practice. They realized that many commenters were not genuinely interested in understanding different viewpoints but rather in reinforcing their own beliefs, often resorting to aggressive or dismissive tactics. The author found that these interactions rarely led to meaningful change in anyone's perspective and instead left them feeling drained and frustrated. They highlight the prevalence of negativity, echo chambers, and the amplification of extreme voices within comment sections.

   The article also touches upon the anonymity afforded by the internet, which can embolden individuals to express opinions more harshly than they would in face-to-face interactions. The author acknowledges their own occasional lapses into unproductive commenting habits, driven by emotions or a desire to "win" an argument. They emphasize the time-consuming nature of engaging in online debates and the opportunity cost of not using that time for more fulfilling or productive activities.

   Ultimately, the author made a conscious decision to disengage from comment culture. This "kissing off" of comment culture involved refraining from reading comment sections, avoiding the temptation to respond to inflammatory or misinformed posts, and redirecting their energy toward more constructive pursuits. The author describes this shift as a positive change in their life, leading to reduced stress, increased mental clarity, and a greater focus on activities that align with their values. They suggest that others who feel similarly burdened by online comment culture might benefit from a similar approach, prioritizing their own well-being and focusing on more meaningful forms of engagement. The author concludes by advocating for more thoughtful and constructive online interactions but recognizes that achieving this requires a collective effort to shift away from the current state of negativity and polarization.
