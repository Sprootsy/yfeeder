  <p>The article is a forum post on the Mozilla Support website where a user, Tonnes, is inquiring about the possibility of automatically saving complete web pages, including all associated resources like images, CSS, and JavaScript, into a single, self-contained HTML file. Tonnes expresses a desire to archive web pages in a format that can be reliably viewed offline in the future, even if the original website disappears or changes. They are specifically asking if Firefox has a built-in feature or an add-on that can achieve this, similar to the "Webpage, complete" option but saving everything into a single .html file instead of creating a folder with separate files.</p>

  <p>Several other users responded to Tonnes' query, offering various suggestions and insights. One user, cor-el, explains that Firefox's "Webpage, complete" option saves the HTML file and all associated resources in a separate folder, which is the standard behavior for this saving method. They mention that while saving to a single HTML file (like "Webpage, HTML only") is possible, it won't include the associated resources, thus defeating the purpose of offline viewing with all elements intact.</p>

  <p>Another user, jscher2000, provides a more detailed explanation and several potential solutions. They clarify that saving a webpage as "Webpage, complete" indeed creates a folder for associated files, which is the typical way browsers handle such saves. They then suggest some add-ons that might achieve the desired single-file saving, such as "SingleFile" or "Save Page WE." They also mention that some archive sites, like the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, have tools or methods to create single-file archives.</p>

  <p>Jscher2000 further elaborates on the challenges of saving a webpage into a single HTML file. They explain that all resources need to be encoded and embedded within the HTML, often using Base64 encoding for images and other binary files. They also acknowledge that very complex pages might exceed the browser's or add-on's capacity to handle the encoding and embedding process. They propose that the "SingleFile" add-on is likely the best option for Firefox and provide a link to it. Additionally, they suggest using the "Save Page WE" extension as an alternative.</p>

  <p>In summary, the forum post discusses the need for a method to save complete webpages into a single HTML file for archival purposes and offline viewing. While Firefox doesn't natively offer this functionality, users in the forum suggest using add-ons like "SingleFile" or "Save Page WE" as potential solutions, while also explaining the technical challenges involved in embedding all resources into a single HTML file.</p>

  <h2>Key points:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The user, Tonnes, wants to save complete web pages (including images, CSS, JavaScript) into a single HTML file for offline archival.</li>
    <li>Firefox's built-in "Webpage, complete" option saves resources in a separate folder, not a single file.</li>
    <li>Saving as "Webpage, HTML only" doesn't include associated resources.</li>
    <li>Users suggest using add-ons like "SingleFile" or "Save Page WE" to achieve single-file saving.</li>
    <li>Saving to a single file involves encoding and embedding all resources (e.g., Base64 encoding).</li>
    <li>Complex pages may exceed the capacity of browsers/add-ons for single-file saving.</li>
