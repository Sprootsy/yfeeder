  <p>Ahmed Saoudi's blog post "Domains I Love" is a personal reflection on the domain names that have resonated with him over the years, categorized by the reasons for his admiration. He doesn't focus on metrics like traffic or revenue but rather on the inherent qualities that make a domain name memorable, effective, or simply pleasing. The author emphasizes the subjective nature of his preferences, acknowledging that others may not share his taste. The domains are grouped into several categories. The first category is <b>"Category-Defining Domains"</b> which represents domain names that have become synonymous with their respective industries or services. Examples include "Booking.com," which is instantly recognizable as a platform for booking accommodations, and "monday.com," which has successfully branded itself as a leading project management tool. These domains have achieved a level of brand recognition that transcends the specific company behind them. Next are <b>"Descriptive and Clear Domains"</b> which directly convey the purpose or content of the website. These domains are easy to understand and remember, reducing the cognitive load on users. Examples include "ineedadiagnostic.com," which clearly indicates a service related to medical diagnostics, and "californiawine.com," which straightforwardly represents information and products related to Californian wine. Next up are <b>"Brandable and Catchy Domains"</b>, which are memorable, unique, and well-suited for building a strong brand identity. These domains often feature short, pronounceable words or phrases that are easy to recall. Examples include "jasper.ai," which is a concise and brandable domain for an AI-powered writing assistant, and "copy.ai," which clearly communicates the product's function while remaining catchy and memorable. Then there are <b>"Location-Based Domains"</b>, which are geographically specific and useful for businesses targeting a particular region or city. Examples include "londonreal.tv," which represents a London-based media platform, and "brooklyn.pizza," which clearly indicates a pizza business located in Brooklyn. These domains are particularly effective for local SEO and attracting local customers. Next are the <b>"Clever and Playful Domains"</b>, which use wordplay, humor, or creative combinations to create a memorable and engaging domain name. Examples include "ship.com," which is short, memorable, and suggestive of shipping services, and "eat.app," which is a catchy and modern domain for a food-related application. These domains stand out due to their originality and ability to create a positive association with the brand. Then are the <b>"Nostalgic Domains"</b> which evoke a sense of the past or a feeling of familiarity. The author seems to have a soft spot for domains from the early internet era. Then the author wraps up with <b>"My Own Domains"</b>, providing some personal context and insight into his own domain name choices. He reflects on his approach to selecting domain names for his own projects, considering factors like brandability, relevance, and memorability. Overall, the article provides a valuable perspective on the qualities that make a domain name effective and appealing, going beyond purely data-driven metrics to explore the subjective aspects of domain name selection.</p>
