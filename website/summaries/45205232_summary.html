  <p>The article, titled "Doomscrolling: The Game," humorously reimagines the act of doomscrolling as a video game. It presents doomscrolling—the practice of compulsively consuming negative news online—as a kind of absurdist, low-stakes challenge. The author describes the mechanics of this hypothetical game, outlining how a player engages with an endless feed of increasingly dire news items. The objective isn't to win, but rather to continue scrolling and absorbing information despite the emotional toll. The game features "upgrades" like stronger coffee or noise-canceling headphones to improve focus, and "achievements" for reaching milestones of continuous scrolling or encountering particularly outrageous headlines. Ultimately, the article uses the gaming analogy to highlight the addictive and somewhat pointless nature of doomscrolling, suggesting that while it may feel compelling in the moment, it rarely leads to positive outcomes.</p>
