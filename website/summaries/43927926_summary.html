  <p>
    The article is a README file for Void, a text editor written in C++ with a focus on performance, extensibility, and user experience. It aims to be a modern editor, drawing inspiration from other editors like Sublime Text, VS Code, and Zed, while also incorporating its own unique features and design philosophies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Void emphasizes a fast and responsive UI, achieved through careful implementation and optimization.  The editor is designed to be highly customizable, offering flexibility in configuring keybindings, themes, and other settings. A core principle is to build a stable and reliable editor suitable for both casual and professional use.  Extensibility is provided through a plugin system that allows users to add new functionality and customize the editor's behavior to suit their specific needs.

    The README outlines the editor's key features, including cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux), native build, modern UI using GPU rendering, syntax highlighting, theming, and a plugin system. It also mentions features under development like autocompletion, diagnostics (e.g., linters, compilers), a built-in file manager, and integration with the Language Server Protocol (LSP). The document provides basic instructions on how to build Void from source on different operating systems, including prerequisites such as CMake, a C++ compiler, and platform-specific dependencies (e.g., X11 or Wayland libraries on Linux). It also provides information on how to contribute to the project, encouraging users to report bugs, suggest features, and submit pull requests. The README highlights the project's commitment to creating a high-quality text editor that meets the needs of a diverse range of users. The "Why?" section elaborates on the motivation behind creating Void, acknowledging the existence of many other text editors but emphasizing the desire to create one that aligns more closely with the developers' personal preferences and technical goals, particularly in terms of performance, customizability, and modern UI/UX design. The project also expresses a desire to provide a clean and well-documented codebase for other developers to learn from and contribute to.
