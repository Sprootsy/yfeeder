    <h2>EFF to court: The Supreme Court must rein in secondary copyright liability</h2>
    <div>

<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is urging the Supreme Court to limit the scope of secondary copyright liability, particularly concerning online platforms. The case in question, <i>Vimeo v. LiveMe</i>, involves allegations that LiveMe, a livestreaming platform, is liable for copyright infringement committed by its users. The EFF argues that the lower court's ruling, which held LiveMe liable, threatens the internet ecosystem by creating overly broad liability for platforms. This could lead to increased censorship, as platforms would be incentivized to remove any content that might potentially infringe copyright, regardless of whether infringement actually occurred.</p>

<p>The EFF emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between direct and secondary copyright infringement. Direct infringement occurs when someone directly violates a copyright, such as by copying or distributing copyrighted material without permission. Secondary infringement, on the other hand, involves holding someone liable for the infringing acts of another. There are two main types of secondary infringement: contributory infringement and vicarious infringement.</p>

<p>Contributory infringement occurs when a party knows of the infringing activity and materially contributes to it. Vicarious infringement occurs when a party has the right and ability to control the infringing conduct and receives a direct financial benefit from it. The EFF argues that the lower court's application of these principles in the <i>Vimeo v. LiveMe</i> case was flawed. Specifically, they contend that LiveMe should not be held liable simply because its platform could be used for infringing activity. They assert that there must be a clearer link between the platform's actions and the specific instances of infringement.</p>

<p>The EFF expresses concern that expansive secondary liability will stifle innovation and free expression online. If platforms are held liable for the actions of their users without a strong showing of knowledge and material contribution to the infringement, they will be forced to err on the side of caution and remove legitimate content. This "over-removal" would harm both creators and the public by limiting access to valuable information and creative works.</p>

<p>The EFF's amicus brief to the Supreme Court emphasizes the need to protect the open and dynamic nature of the internet. They argue that the Court should reaffirm the principles that limit secondary copyright liability and prevent the creation of a system in which platforms are constantly policing their users' content. The EFF believes that a narrow interpretation of secondary liability is essential to preserve the balance between copyright protection and free expression.</p>
