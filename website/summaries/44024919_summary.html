<h3>Summary</h3>

It details how hackers and other malicious actors are exploiting vulnerabilities in crypto exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and individual wallets to steal digital assets. The article highlights the unique challenges in recovering stolen crypto due to the decentralized and often anonymous nature of blockchain technology. It explains how attackers use sophisticated techniques, including phishing, malware, and exploiting code vulnerabilities, to pilfer funds.

The report emphasizes that the lack of robust security measures, particularly in newer DeFi projects, makes them lucrative targets. It notes the involvement of North Korean hacking groups in some of the most significant crypto heists, which allegedly use the stolen funds to support their government.
