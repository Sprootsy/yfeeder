  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>
   The article "Things That Aren't Doing the Thing" explores the phenomenon where systems or entities, despite being designed or intended for a specific purpose, fail to effectively fulfill that purpose. It examines various reasons why such failures occur, delving into the complexities of aligning intentions with actual outcomes.

   The author begins by highlighting that simply having a stated goal or function doesn't guarantee its realization. They introduce the idea that things often exist in a state of "not doing the thing" they are supposed to do, even when they appear to be functioning on the surface.
  </p>
  <p>
   One key reason explored is the misalignment between the intended purpose and the incentives or pressures acting on the system. For example, a company might claim to prioritize customer satisfaction, but its compensation structure primarily rewards sales volume, leading employees to prioritize sales over customer care. This creates a situation where the company isn't truly "doing the thing" of satisfying customers, even though it claims to be.

   The article discusses the impact of complexity on achieving intended outcomes. As systems become more intricate, with numerous interconnected parts and feedback loops, it becomes increasingly difficult to predict and control their behavior. Unintended consequences and emergent behaviors can arise, causing the system to deviate from its intended purpose.

   Another factor considered is the role of measurement and metrics. The author points out that what gets measured gets managed, but that the wrong metrics can lead to unintended and undesirable consequences. If a system is measured solely on easily quantifiable factors, it may optimize for those factors at the expense of other, more important, but less measurable aspects of its purpose.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article also touches upon the importance of feedback loops and adaptation. Systems that lack effective feedback mechanisms may be unable to detect when they are not "doing the thing" and make necessary adjustments. Similarly, systems that are inflexible and unable to adapt to changing circumstances are more likely to fall short of their intended purpose.
  </p>

   Furthermore, the author discusses the problem of goal displacement, where the means become the end. In such cases, the focus shifts from achieving the original purpose to simply maintaining the system itself, even if it's no longer effective.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring, evaluation, and adaptation to ensure that systems remain aligned with their intended purposes. It encourages a critical examination of assumptions, incentives, and feedback loops to identify and address situations where things are "not doing the thing" they are supposed to do.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ultimately, the author suggests that actively working to align incentives, measure meaningful outcomes, and remain vigilant about goal displacement can help in steering things towards their intended purpose, increasing the likelihood of them "doing the thing."
