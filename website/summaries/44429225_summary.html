  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article discusses "hooks" within the context of Claude, an AI assistant. Hooks are mechanisms that allow Claude to interact with external tools and APIs during a conversation. These tools enable Claude to access real-time information, perform actions, and augment its capabilities beyond its pre-trained knowledge.
  </p>
  <p>
    The document describes how to define and use tools within a Claude conversation. It covers aspects such as tool schemas, which define the input parameters and expected output format of a tool. When a user's prompt requires external information or action, Claude can recognize the need to use a relevant tool. It then generates a structured API call based on the tool's schema, which includes the necessary input parameters. This API call is then executed by an external service.
  </p>
  <p>
    The results of the API call are then fed back to Claude, allowing it to incorporate the external information into its response to the user. This process enhances Claude's ability to answer questions accurately, perform tasks, and provide more relevant and up-to-date information. The document further illustrates this process using code examples, including details on how to define tool schemas in JSON format and integrate them into Claude conversations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article also emphasizes the importance of carefully designing tool schemas to ensure Claude can effectively utilize the tools and provide useful results. It also details how tool use can be disabled, if desired.
