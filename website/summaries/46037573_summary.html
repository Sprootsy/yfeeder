  <p>GrapheneOS, a privacy-focused Android-based operating system, has migrated its server infrastructure from France due to claims of police intimidation. The project developers allege that French authorities targeted their hosting provider, OVH, with demands for sensitive data and engaged in intimidating tactics. While the specific details of the requests and the nature of the intimidation remain somewhat vague, the GrapheneOS team decided to relocate their servers to a new jurisdiction to protect their project and user data.</p>

  <p>The primary reason for the relocation was the perceived risk to the project's security and the privacy of its users. The GrapheneOS team expressed concerns that the French authorities' actions could compromise the integrity of their services and potentially expose user information. By moving their infrastructure, they aim to reduce the risk of unwarranted access to their systems and data.</p>

  <p>OVH, the hosting provider, has not publicly commented on the specific allegations made by GrapheneOS. However, the GrapheneOS team indicated that OVH was cooperative during the process of migrating the servers and did not appear to be complicit in the alleged intimidation. The decision to move was primarily driven by the GrapheneOS team's assessment of the overall risk environment in France.</p>

  <p>The GrapheneOS team did not disclose the new location of their servers, citing security reasons. They emphasized that they chose a jurisdiction with stronger protections for privacy and freedom of expression. This move is part of GrapheneOS's ongoing commitment to protecting its users and maintaining the highest standards of security and privacy.</p>
