  <p>The article describes Literate, a tool for literate programming. Literate programming is a programming paradigm where code is written alongside documentation in a single file. Literate allows users to write code and documentation in Markdown, and then extract the code into separate files for compilation and execution. This allows developers to write well-documented code that is also easy to read and understand.</p>

  <p>Literate uses a simple syntax for embedding code blocks within Markdown documents. Code blocks are denoted by special markers, and Literate can extract these code blocks into separate files, while ignoring the surrounding documentation. Literate also supports features such as code block naming, which allows developers to refer to code blocks by name in other parts of the document. This can be useful for organizing code and making it easier to reuse.</p>

  <p>The article also discusses the benefits of literate programming, such as improved code readability, better documentation, and easier code reuse. Literate helps developers to write code that is both well-documented and easy to understand, which can lead to improved software quality and maintainability.</p>
