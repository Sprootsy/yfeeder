<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Dillo is a fast, small-footprint, multi-platform graphical web browser. It is known for its speed and minimal resource usage, making it suitable for older hardware or systems where efficiency is paramount. Dillo is written in C and C++, and it uses FLTK (Fast Light Toolkit) for its graphical interface. It aims to be lightweight and does not rely on large or complex rendering engines like Gecko (Firefox) or WebKit (Safari, Chrome). Instead, it implements its own rendering engine, which supports a subset of HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>A key design principle of Dillo is to avoid unnecessary features and complexity. As a result, it does not support JavaScript, Flash, or Java. While this limits its ability to display certain modern web content, it significantly reduces its attack surface and improves security. Dillo focuses on rendering simple, static HTML content efficiently.</p>
<p>Dillo supports multiple platforms, including Linux, BSD, macOS, and other Unix-like operating systems. It is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL), making it free and open-source software. The browser is configurable through a configuration file, allowing users to customize aspects such as fonts, colors, and default behaviors.</p>
<p>Due to its limitations in supporting modern web technologies, Dillo is often used in specific contexts such as browsing lightweight websites, accessing documentation, or running on embedded systems. It is not intended to be a full-featured browser for everyday use on the modern web but rather a tool for specific tasks where speed and resource efficiency are more important than complete web compatibility.</p>
<p>The Dillo project is maintained by a small team of developers, and contributions are welcome. The browser has a dedicated user base who appreciate its simplicity and performance.</p>
