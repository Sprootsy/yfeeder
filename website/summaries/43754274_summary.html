        <p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has taken action against Uber Technologies, Inc. for allegedly deceiving consumers with deceptive billing and cancellation practices. According to the FTC, Uber misrepresented the estimated cost of rides to customers and made it difficult for them to cancel rides. The FTC alleges that Uber's practices violated the FTC Act.</p>
<p>Specifically, the FTC claims that Uber provided inaccurate fare estimates, leading consumers to believe rides would cost less than they actually did. These inaccurate estimates allegedly occurred due to flaws in Uber's fare estimation algorithms and were not adequately disclosed to consumers. The FTC also alleges that Uber made it difficult for consumers to cancel rides without incurring fees. The company allegedly obscured the cancellation policy and imposed fees even when drivers were significantly delayed or failed to arrive at the designated pickup location.</p>
<p>As a result of these alleged deceptive practices, the FTC has filed a complaint against Uber and is seeking a court order to prevent the company from continuing these practices. The FTC also seeks monetary penalties to compensate consumers who were harmed by Uber's actions. The FTC's action against Uber is part of its broader effort to protect consumers from deceptive and unfair business practices in the gig economy.</p>
