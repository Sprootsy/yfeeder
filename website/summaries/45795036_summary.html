    <h2>Simple trick to increase coverage: Lying to users about signal strength</h2>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The article on nickvsnetworking.com discusses a technique used by some Wi-Fi vendors to artificially inflate the reported signal strength on client devices. The author refers to this practice as "lying" to users about the actual signal strength. The core idea is that by exaggerating the signal strength displayed on devices like laptops and phones, users perceive a better Wi-Fi experience, even if the actual signal quality is not as good as indicated. This can lead to increased user satisfaction and fewer complaints about Wi-Fi connectivity issues.</p>
<p>The author explains that this is achieved by manipulating the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) or similar metrics reported by the Wi-Fi access point.  Instead of accurately reflecting the true signal strength, the access point reports a higher value. This inflated value is then displayed on the user's device, leading them to believe they have a stronger connection than they actually do. The article suggests this is more prevalent in consumer-grade Wi-Fi equipment, where ease of use and perceived performance often take precedence over technical accuracy.</p>
<p>The potential problem with this approach is that while it might improve user perception in the short term, it can mask underlying issues with the Wi-Fi network. For example, if a user is experiencing slow speeds or intermittent connectivity, they might assume the Wi-Fi signal is strong based on the displayed signal strength indicator, and therefore not investigate other potential causes, such as interference, network congestion, or misconfigured access points. It can also make troubleshooting Wi-Fi problems more difficult, as the reported signal strength is not a reliable indicator of the actual connection quality.</p>
<p>The author also points out that this practice is not necessarily malicious, but rather a trade-off between technical accuracy and user experience. Many users don't understand the technical details of Wi-Fi signal strength and simply want to see a full or near-full signal bar. By providing this, vendors can reduce support calls and improve customer satisfaction, even if it means sacrificing some accuracy. However, the article cautions that relying solely on the displayed signal strength can be misleading and that users should be aware of this potential discrepancy when evaluating their Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<p>The author concludes by suggesting that while artificially inflating signal strength might seem like a harmless way to improve user perception, it's important to understand the limitations of this approach and to consider other factors that can affect Wi-Fi performance. Users should focus on actual performance metrics, such as speed and latency, rather than solely relying on the displayed signal strength indicator.</p>
