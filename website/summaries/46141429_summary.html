    <h2>Why doesn&#39;t Apple make a standalone Touch ID?</h2>

<p>The article discusses why Apple doesn't produce standalone Touch ID fingerprint sensors for use with devices other than their own, specifically focusing on desktop computers like the Mac Mini or older Apple keyboards. The author posits that Apple's reluctance stems from several factors, including security concerns and Apple's ecosystem strategy.</p>

<p>The primary concern revolves around security. Touch ID's security model, particularly with Apple's T1 and T2 chips and the Secure Enclave, relies on a secure, encrypted communication channel between the sensor and the secure enclave. Making a standalone Touch ID device would require opening up this secure communication protocol, potentially exposing it to vulnerabilities. The fingerprint data would have to travel over USB or another interface, which could be intercepted or manipulated. This would undermine the security that Apple has worked hard to establish within its ecosystem.</p>

<p>Additionally, Apple's business strategy favors tight integration and control over both hardware and software. Selling standalone Touch ID sensors would mean supporting them across different operating systems and hardware configurations, which is contrary to Apple's typical approach. Apple prefers to offer complete solutions where they control the entire user experience.</p>

<p>The article also suggests that the market demand for standalone Touch ID might not be large enough to justify the engineering effort and support overhead. Most users who prioritize biometric authentication on their desktops are likely already using devices like MacBooks or iMacs, which have Touch ID integrated. The niche market of users wanting to add Touch ID to older Macs or custom-built PCs might not be substantial enough for Apple to pursue.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the author points out that integrating Touch ID into a standalone device would require additional components like a microcontroller to manage the sensor and handle communication with the host computer. This would add to the cost and complexity of the device, potentially making it less appealing to consumers.</p>

<p>Finally, the author mentions that Apple's focus is shifting towards Face ID as the primary biometric authentication method. Investing in standalone Touch ID might be seen as a step backward when Apple is actively pushing for Face ID adoption across its product line. Therefore, they are unlikely to invest resources into a technology that is, from their point of view, being superseded by Face ID.</p>
