   <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
   <p>The article details the author's frustrating experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS) when their 10-year-old account was unexpectedly terminated without prior warning. The author, who used the account primarily for personal projects and had a small monthly spend, discovered the account was closed after attempting to log in. Upon contacting AWS support, they were informed that the account was closed due to a violation of the AWS Acceptable Use Policy. However, AWS refused to provide specific details regarding the violation, citing security reasons. The author vehemently denies engaging in any malicious activities, such as hacking, spamming, or illegal activities, and expresses bewilderment at the lack of transparency and due process from AWS. They highlight their history as a long-term, paying customer and the potential damage such abrupt actions could inflict on businesses relying on AWS. The author suspects the termination may be linked to a specific EC2 instance they were running, possibly triggered by a security vulnerability or misconfiguration they were unaware of. Despite multiple attempts to appeal the decision and obtain more information, AWS remained uncooperative and unyielding. The author expresses concern over the implications of AWS's actions, particularly the lack of warning and the potential for similar situations to affect other users, including those with critical business infrastructure on the platform. The author also questions the fairness and effectiveness of AWS's account termination process, emphasizing the need for clearer communication, more specific explanations, and a more reasonable appeal process to protect legitimate users from unwarranted account closures.</p>
