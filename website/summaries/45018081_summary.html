<div>
  <p>
    Fenster is a minimalist cross-platform library for creating native GUI windows with OpenGL rendering context. It is designed to be simple to use and integrate into existing OpenGL projects, providing only the essential functionality for window creation, event handling, and OpenGL context management.
  </p>
  <p>
    The library supports multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, aiming to provide a consistent API across these different operating systems. It abstracts away the platform-specific details of window creation and management, allowing developers to focus on their OpenGL rendering code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fenster is implemented in C and offers a C API, making it suitable for use with a variety of programming languages, including C, C++, and languages with C bindings. This allows developers to integrate Fenster into their existing projects without needing to adopt a specific language or framework.
  </p>
  <p>
    The library's features include creating and destroying windows, setting window titles, managing window size and position, handling keyboard and mouse input events, and managing the OpenGL rendering context. It provides functions for polling events, swapping buffers, and setting window properties.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fenster aims to be lightweight and dependency-free, minimizing the amount of code and external libraries required to create a GUI window. This makes it suitable for projects where size and performance are important considerations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The library provides example code and documentation to help developers get started with using Fenster in their projects. The examples demonstrate how to create a window, set up an OpenGL context, and handle basic input events.
