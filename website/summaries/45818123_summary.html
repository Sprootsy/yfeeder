    The famed Eisbachwelle river wave in Munich, a popular spot for surfers, has vanished due to construction work on a nearby underground project. The wave, created artificially by concrete slabs in the Eisbach river, had become a significant attraction, drawing surfers and tourists from around the world for over five decades. The disappearance of the wave has left the local surfing community stunned and disappointed.

    The construction, part of a larger project to reinforce the riverbed and build a new underground line, required the removal of the concrete structures that formed the wave. City officials have acknowledged the wave's importance and have stated that efforts are underway to recreate it once the construction is completed, possibly within the next two years.
