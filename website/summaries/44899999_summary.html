<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>Apple is providing an update regarding the Blood Oxygen feature on Apple Watch models sold in the United States. Following a recent court ruling regarding a patent dispute, Apple is taking steps to comply with the order. While the specific details of the court ruling and the patent in question are not elaborated upon in this news release, the core message is that Apple is proactively addressing the legal situation.</p>
<p>The primary action being taken by Apple is to disable the Blood Oxygen feature on new Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models sold in the US, starting on August 9, 2025. This change only affects units sold in the United States; Apple Watch models sold in other countries are not impacted, and neither are previously purchased Apple Watches in the US. Customers who have already purchased an Apple Watch with the Blood Oxygen feature will still be able to use it without any changes or interruptions. The functionality will remain fully operational on their existing devices.</p>
<p>Apple emphasizes that this action is being taken to ensure compliance with the court ruling. The company also states its commitment to its customers and assures them that it is taking steps to continue offering the Apple Watch with all its features in the future. They are actively pursuing other options to resolve the patent dispute and restore the Blood Oxygen feature to new Apple Watch models sold in the US as soon as possible.</p>
