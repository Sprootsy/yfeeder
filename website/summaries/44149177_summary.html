<h2>Summary:</h2>

The article is a README file for Redirector, a simple HTTP server that redirects incoming requests to a specified URL. It's designed to be lightweight and easy to use, primarily for development and testing purposes. Redirector can be configured via command-line arguments to specify the port it listens on, the target URL to redirect to, and the HTTP status code to use for the redirection. It supports both temporary (302 Found) and permanent (301 Moved Permanently) redirects, as well as other status codes. The tool is written in Go and can be easily installed using `go install`. The README provides clear instructions on how to run Redirector with different configurations, including setting the port, target URL, and status code. The author, Einar Egilsson, emphasizes its simplicity and utility for scenarios where a quick and configurable redirect server is needed. It also touches on how to install and run the application.
