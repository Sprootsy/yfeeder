<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>OpenBSD 7.8 was released on November 2, 2025. This release represents a significant step forward for the project, incorporating numerous improvements, new features, and hardware support enhancements across various system components.
</p>
<p>
A major highlight is the enhanced hardware support. OpenBSD 7.8 introduces support for a range of new hardware, including various network interface cards, storage controllers, and graphics adapters. This broadens the compatibility of OpenBSD with modern systems and allows users to leverage the operating system on a wider array of devices. Specific examples include support for newer wireless chipsets, enabling improved wireless networking capabilities, and enhancements to storage drivers, resulting in better performance and stability with modern SSDs and NVMe drives.
</p>
<p>
The kernel has received considerable attention in this release, with improvements focused on performance, security, and stability. Memory management has been optimized to reduce overhead and improve overall system responsiveness. Scheduling algorithms have been refined to provide fairer allocation of resources among processes, leading to smoother multitasking and better performance under heavy load. Security enhancements include additional mitigations against common attack vectors, further strengthening OpenBSD's reputation as a security-focused operating system.
</p>
<p>
Networking capabilities have also been significantly enhanced. The network stack has been optimized for higher throughput and lower latency, benefiting network-intensive applications and services. Support for new networking protocols and standards has been added, allowing OpenBSD to seamlessly integrate with modern network environments. The introduction of new tools and utilities for network monitoring and management provides administrators with greater visibility and control over network traffic.
</p>
<p>
The OpenBSD base system has been updated with the latest versions of key software components. This includes updated compilers, libraries, and utilities, ensuring that users have access to the most recent features and security patches. These updates also provide developers with a modern and robust development environment for building and deploying applications on OpenBSD.
</p>
<p>
Security remains a paramount concern in OpenBSD 7.8. Numerous security audits and code reviews have been conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. New security features have been implemented to further harden the system against attacks. These include enhanced exploit mitigations, improved privilege separation, and stricter enforcement of security policies.
</p>
<p>
The installation process has been streamlined and simplified, making it easier for new users to get started with OpenBSD. The installer now provides more intuitive options and better guidance, reducing the learning curve for those unfamiliar with the operating system. Improvements to the boot process ensure a faster and more reliable startup experience.
</p>
<p>
OpenBSD 7.8 includes improvements to virtualization, with enhanced support for both hosting and guesting virtual machines. The included hypervisor, vmd(8), has been updated with performance improvements and new features, making it a more capable platform for virtualization workloads.
</p>
<p>
The release also features improvements to the user experience, with updates to the graphical environment, command-line tools, and documentation. These improvements make OpenBSD more user-friendly and accessible to a wider range of users.
