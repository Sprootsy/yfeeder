<h3>Summary:</h3>
The provided URL (sso.tax) leads to a website that promotes Single Sales Factor Apportionment (SSO) as a fairer method of state corporate income tax. The website presents information advocating for states to adopt SSO, arguing that it encourages job creation and economic growth within those states. The core concept of SSO is that a company's income tax liability to a specific state is based *solely* on the percentage of its sales within that state, disregarding the proportions of its property or payroll located there.

The website details how traditional three-factor apportionment formulas (which consider sales, property, and payroll) can penalize businesses that invest heavily in a state, either through significant property holdings or a large workforce. By shifting to SSO, states can create a more attractive environment for businesses to expand their operations and hire more employees, as their tax burden would be directly tied to their sales within the state, not their physical presence or employment numbers. The site contends that SSO can level the playing field, particularly for manufacturers and companies with substantial physical assets.

Furthermore, the site argues that SSO can simplify tax compliance for businesses, especially those operating in multiple states. By focusing solely on sales data, the administrative burden and potential for errors in calculating tax liabilities are reduced. The website also touches upon the potential economic benefits for states adopting SSO, suggesting that it can lead to increased investment, job growth, and a more competitive business environment.

The website provides resources, including explanations of SSO, arguments in its favor, and potentially data or studies supporting its adoption.
