    According to a Bloomberg Businessweek article, the artificial intelligence boom, potentially reaching $1 trillion, is significantly fueled by circular deals involving companies like OpenAI, Nvidia, and AMD. These companies are not only customers but also investors in each other, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of growth and investment.
  </p>
  <p>
    The AI boom has led to unprecedented demand for AI chips, primarily manufactured by Nvidia and, to a lesser extent, AMD. OpenAI, at the forefront of AI development with models like GPT, requires massive computing power, thus becoming a major customer for these chipmakers. Simultaneously, venture capital firms, often backed by or affiliated with these tech giants, are investing heavily in AI startups, which in turn increases the demand for AI chips and cloud computing resources provided by companies like Microsoft (a significant partner and investor in OpenAI).
  </p>
  <p>
    This creates a closed-loop system where investments in AI startups drive demand for AI infrastructure, benefiting chip manufacturers and cloud providers. The profits generated then flow back into further AI development and investment, thus perpetuating the cycle. The article highlights the potential risks associated with such interconnectedness, including the possibility of an AI bubble, where valuations become disconnected from underlying fundamentals.
  </p>
  <p>
    The author mentions the increasing scrutiny from regulators, particularly regarding antitrust concerns. The close relationships and mutual investments among key players in the AI industry could raise questions about market dominance and fair competition. The article implies that the current structure of the AI market, with its circular investments and dependencies, may not be sustainable in the long run without careful oversight and regulation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Specifically, it appears that OpenAI's reliance on Microsoft's cloud infrastructure and Nvidia/AMD's chips ties them closely to these companies' financial performance and strategic decisions. Should any of these core components falter, the entire AI ecosystem could face significant disruption. The article suggests the need for diversification and risk mitigation strategies to prevent the AI boom from turning into a bust.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, the article raises questions about the long-term implications of this concentrated ecosystem. While the circular deals are currently driving innovation and growth, they also create potential vulnerabilities and raise ethical considerations around the concentration of power and control in the AI sector.
