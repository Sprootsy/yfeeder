  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The article, titled "There are People Who Can See and People Who Cannot," explores the concept of societal blindness to underlying truths and systemic issues, particularly focusing on historical and contemporary power structures. It argues that throughout history, a select few have possessed the ability to perceive the realities of their time, while the majority remain oblivious, often due to ingrained ideologies, propaganda, or a simple unwillingness to confront uncomfortable truths.
  The author uses historical examples such as the justifications for slavery, the rise of Nazi Germany, and the Cold War to illustrate how widespread acceptance of dominant narratives can blind individuals to the moral and ethical implications of their actions or inaction. These narratives, often perpetuated by those in power, serve to maintain the status quo and suppress dissent. The article posits that those who "can see" are often marginalized, persecuted, or ignored, as their perspectives challenge the established order.
  Furthermore, the article delves into the modern manifestations of this societal blindness, pointing to issues such as economic inequality, environmental destruction, and the influence of corporate power. The author suggests that the constant bombardment of information and misinformation in the digital age further exacerbates the problem, making it increasingly difficult for individuals to discern truth from falsehood. The piece also discusses the role of fear and self-preservation in perpetuating this blindness, as people may be hesitant to challenge the system for fear of retribution or social ostracism.
  The author contends that overcoming this societal blindness requires critical thinking, a willingness to question authority, and a commitment to seeking out diverse perspectives. It involves actively engaging with uncomfortable truths and challenging the narratives that are presented as absolute or unquestionable. Only by cultivating this ability to "see" can societies hope to address the pressing challenges they face and create a more just and equitable world. The article acknowledges the difficulty of this task, as it often involves confronting deeply ingrained beliefs and challenging powerful institutions. However, it emphasizes the importance of striving for greater awareness and understanding, even in the face of opposition.</p>
