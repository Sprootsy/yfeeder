<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The article "Two Ideals of Fields" by Susam Pal explores two contrasting ideals or approaches to the study and application of fields within mathematics: the "pure" ideal and the "applied" ideal. The author argues that while both ideals are valuable, they often lead to different perspectives and priorities. Understanding these differences can help bridge the gap between theoretical and practical aspects of field-related disciplines.</p>

<p>The "pure" ideal, as described in the article, emphasizes the abstract, axiomatic, and structural properties of fields. Those who subscribe to this ideal are often more interested in the intrinsic mathematical beauty and elegance of the theory. The focus is on generalization, abstraction, and the discovery of deep connections within mathematics itself.  Examples include exploring field extensions, Galois theory, and the classification of different types of fields based on their algebraic properties. The driving force is often the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, without immediate concern for practical applications.  Pure field theory is concerned with answering fundamental questions about the nature of fields, such as their structure, their possible extensions, and their relationships to other algebraic structures. This approach values rigor, generality, and internal consistency above all else.</p>

<p>In contrast, the "applied" ideal prioritizes the use of fields as tools for solving concrete problems in various domains. This approach emphasizes computational efficiency, practical relevance, and the development of algorithms.  Applications of fields arise in diverse areas such as coding theory, cryptography, computer science, and engineering. Those who subscribe to the applied ideal are more interested in the computational aspects of field theory, such as the efficient implementation of field arithmetic, the construction of finite fields with specific properties, and the use of fields in error-correcting codes.  The focus is on finding solutions to real-world problems, even if it means sacrificing some of the elegance or generality of the underlying theory. Efficiency and practicality are key considerations.  For example, the application of finite fields in cryptography demands fields that allow for rapid computations and secure encryption schemes.</p>

<p>The article further elaborates on the different perspectives regarding the choice of fields themselves. The "pure" ideal might favor studying fields with exotic properties or infinite fields, even if they have limited immediate practical applications. The "applied" ideal, however, typically focuses on fields that are well-suited for computation, such as finite fields or fields of rational functions. The author suggests that both approaches have merit and contribute to the overall understanding and utilization of fields. A healthy balance between theoretical and practical considerations is crucial for progress in field-related disciplines.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the article discusses the trade-offs involved in choosing between the two ideals. Pursuing pure research can lead to unexpected discoveries and provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematical structures, which may later find applications in unexpected areas. On the other hand, focusing solely on applied research can lead to a narrow view of the subject and neglect potentially valuable theoretical insights.  The article advocates for a more integrated approach, where theoretical and practical perspectives inform and complement each other. Collaboration between pure and applied mathematicians can lead to significant breakthroughs and a more comprehensive understanding of fields.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the article presents a balanced view of the "pure" and "applied" ideals in the study of fields, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing and appreciating the different motivations and priorities that drive researchers in these two areas. The author ultimately suggests that a synergistic relationship between pure and applied field theory is essential for advancing both the theoretical understanding and practical application of fields.</p>
