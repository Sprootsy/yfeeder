The article from Smithsonian Magazine discusses the historical practice of sending children through the U.S. Postal Service, primarily in the early 20th century. This unusual phenomenon arose after the establishment of Parcel Post in 1913, which expanded the types of items that could be mailed and reduced shipping costs. While not explicitly legal, there was no specific regulation prohibiting sending humans, and some parents took advantage of the service to send their children to relatives, often in rural areas.

The first documented case occurred shortly after Parcel Post was introduced, when a couple in Ohio mailed their son to his grandmother who lived a few miles away. The cost was just 15 cents. Other instances followed, with children being sent by train with postal workers to their destinations. The reasons for this practice varied, but financial constraints and the desire to have children cared for by family members were common factors. Rural families, in particular, sometimes found it more affordable and convenient to mail their children rather than pay for train tickets.

While the Postal Service generally tolerated the practice, they began to discourage it as it became more publicized and raised concerns about safety and liability. Postmasters General issued statements advising against mailing children, and eventually, regulations were clarified to explicitly prohibit it. By the 1920s, the practice had largely ceased.

The article highlights the unique circumstances of the time, including the novelty of Parcel Post, the economic hardships faced by some families, and the trust placed in the postal system. The stories of children being mailed serve as a quirky example of how people adapted to new technologies and regulations, and how the postal service played a crucial role in connecting communities.
