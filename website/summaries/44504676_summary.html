  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>The Xen Harmful Library (xen-harmful-lib) is a software library designed to introduce controlled vulnerabilities and potentially harmful functionalities into Xen-based systems for testing and research purposes. It provides a collection of tools and modules that can simulate various security flaws, allowing researchers and developers to evaluate the effectiveness of security measures, test vulnerability detection techniques, and study the impact of exploits in a safe and controlled environment. The library focuses on introducing a range of vulnerabilities, from memory corruption issues to privilege escalation opportunities, and aims to provide a flexible and configurable framework for simulating real-world attack scenarios.</p>
