<h3>Summary:</h3>
The article "LLM From Scratch (22): Finally Training Our LLM" by Giles Thomas documents the final steps in building a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch. It focuses on the actual training process, building upon the previously established foundation of data processing, model architecture, and training infrastructure. The author details the configuration used for the training run, including the hardware setup (8xA100 GPUs), batch size, learning rate, and other hyperparameters. The article emphasizes the importance of monitoring the training process to identify potential issues such as divergence or slow convergence. Early results and observations are discussed, highlighting both successes and areas for improvement.

The author mentions a few key observations, such as the model's ability to memorize training data (evidenced by verbatim reproduction of training sentences). They also point out the model's struggles with longer sequences. This initial evaluation helps to inform future iterations and refinements. The article acknowledges the significant amount of time and resources required to train even a small LLM from scratch and frames this initial training run as a crucial step in the ongoing process of improvement.

The author does not provide specific code snippets in this article but refers to the prior steps in his series. It is implied that this stage is the culmination of all the previous steps and focuses more on the practical aspects and initial findings of the training process itself. Further work will be dedicated to iteratively improving the LLM's performance and capabilities, by adjusting hyperparameters, model architecture, or even the training data itself. The article concludes with a sense of accomplishment and anticipation for the future development of the LLM.
