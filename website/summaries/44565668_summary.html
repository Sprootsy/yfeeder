    <h2>Apple&#39;s MLX adding CUDA support</h2>
    <div>

  <p>This GitHub Pull Request (PR) introduces a new example to the mlx-examples repository showcasing how to fine-tune a Stable Diffusion model using the MLX framework on an Apple Silicon Mac. The example includes scripts and instructions for downloading a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, adapting it for fine-tuning, and performing the fine-tuning process using a custom dataset of images.  The goal is to enable users to personalize the Stable Diffusion model to generate images with specific styles or content that are not well-represented in the original training data.</p>

  <p>The PR adds several files to the `stable_diffusion` directory within the `mlx-examples` repository. These include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>`model.py`: This file likely defines the Stable Diffusion model architecture using MLX primitives, including modifications required to enable fine-tuning, such as unfreezing certain layers or adding new trainable parameters.</li>
    <li>`utils.py`: This file would likely contain utility functions for loading and preprocessing the dataset, generating prompts, sampling from the model, and saving/loading model weights.</li>
    <li>`train.py`: This is the main training script, which handles the training loop, data loading, loss computation, and optimization. It will use the MLX framework to perform efficient training on Apple Silicon.</li>
    <li>`load.py`: This script probably handles loading the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model weights from a standard format (like Diffusers) and converting them to the MLX format.</li>
    <li>`sample.py`:  A script for sampling images from the fine-tuned model given a text prompt, allowing users to generate images using their personalized model.</li>
    <li>`README.md`:  A detailed document explaining how to use the example, including instructions for setting up the environment, downloading data, running the training script, and generating samples.  It should cover any necessary dependencies and parameters.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The fine-tuning process will likely involve the following steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>**Environment Setup:**  Installing MLX and other required Python packages.</li>
    <li>**Data Preparation:** Downloading or creating a custom dataset of images relevant to the desired fine-tuning goal.  This data is likely preprocessed and formatted for use with the MLX model.</li>
    <li>**Model Loading:**  Downloading a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model (e.g., from Hugging Face Hub) and converting its weights to the MLX format using the `load.py` script.</li>
    <li>**Fine-Tuning:** Running the `train.py` script to fine-tune the model on the prepared dataset. This script will optimize the model's parameters using a loss function that encourages the model to generate images similar to those in the custom dataset, conditioned on the provided text prompts.</li>
    <li>**Sampling:**  Using the `sample.py` script to generate new images using the fine-tuned model, conditioned on text prompts.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The `README.md` file likely emphasizes the benefits of using MLX for this task, such as its efficiency and performance on Apple Silicon, which can significantly reduce training time compared to other frameworks. The example probably includes guidance on setting appropriate hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of training steps) for effective fine-tuning.</p>

  <p>The inclusion of this example contributes to the mlx-examples repository by providing a practical demonstration of using MLX for a popular and computationally demanding task like Stable Diffusion fine-tuning, making it easier for users to adopt and leverage MLX for their own machine learning projects.</p>
