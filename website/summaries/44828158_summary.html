<h2>Summary</h2>
The article discusses the German exit tax, a tax levied on individuals who move away from Germany if they meet certain criteria related to their business interests. The primary aim of the exit tax is to prevent individuals from avoiding German taxes on unrealized capital gains by relocating to a country with lower or no taxes before selling their business or shares.

The exit tax applies if an individual has been a resident of Germany for at least five years within the last ten years and holds a substantial interest in a corporation (AG, GmbH) whether directly or indirectly. A substantial interest is defined as owning at least 1% of the corporation's share capital. When these conditions are met, moving the tax residency outside of Germany triggers a deemed sale of the business assets or shares. The difference between the fair market value and the acquisition cost of these assets is then subject to German income tax.

The tax applies not only to the individual moving abroad but also to situations where the company's effective place of management is transferred out of Germany. There are some exceptions and deferral options available. For example, if the relocation is to another EU or EEA country, the tax can be deferred under certain conditions, such as providing security to the tax authorities. However, this deferral is not indefinite and the tax becomes due if the assets are actually sold, transferred, or if the individual moves to a non-EU/EEA country.

The article highlights the importance of planning and seeking professional advice before relocating from Germany if one has significant business interests there. The exit tax can have a substantial financial impact, and understanding the rules and available options is crucial for minimizing tax liabilities. Recent changes in legislation have tightened the rules around the exit tax, making it even more important to be aware of the potential consequences of relocation.

The article also touches on the complexities of determining residency status for tax purposes, the valuation of assets, and the interaction of the exit tax with double taxation treaties. It underscores that the exit tax is a complex area of German tax law, and individuals contemplating a move from Germany should seek expert advice to navigate the rules and ensure compliance.
