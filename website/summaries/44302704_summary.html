<p>The article is a critical analysis of the visual presentation of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass DLC on the Nintendo Switch, arguing that its SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) implementation fails to leverage the potential of modern HDR (High Dynamic Range) displays. The author, Alexander Mejia, contends that the game's visuals, while colorful, lack depth and contrast, resulting in a flat and uninspired appearance, especially when compared to how the game could look on HDR-capable screens.</p>

<p>Mejia begins by establishing the advancements in display technology, highlighting the capabilities of modern HDR TVs to deliver a wider range of colors, deeper blacks, and brighter highlights, creating a more immersive and realistic viewing experience. He then contrasts this with the Switch's SDR output, arguing that it limits the visual fidelity of games, even those with vibrant art styles like Mario Kart. He specifically criticizes the Booster Course Pass for its washed-out colors and lack of dynamic range, suggesting that it looks like a "fake HDR" image, where the color palette is artificially boosted without the corresponding increase in contrast or detail.</p>

<p>The author further argues that the Booster Course Pass, by not utilizing the potential of HDR, undermines the progress made in display technology and presents a missed opportunity for Nintendo to showcase its games in a more visually compelling way. He acknowledges that the Switch is a portable console and that HDR implementation might have been limited by hardware constraints, but he believes that Nintendo could have done more to optimize the game's visuals for HDR displays, even if it meant sacrificing some performance or resolution.</p>

<p>Mejia emphasizes that the issue isn't merely about technical specifications but also about artistic intent. He argues that the lack of dynamic range flattens the image, making it appear less three-dimensional and engaging. He suggests that Nintendo should consider developing future games with HDR in mind, or at least provide options for HDR output on compatible devices. He also states that the Booster Course Pass courses could have been great looking if they were designed for HDR, but that they look bland and uninspired instead.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the article serves as a critique of Nintendo's approach to visual fidelity on the Switch, particularly in the context of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass. Mejia argues that the game's SDR implementation fails to take advantage of modern display technology and that Nintendo should prioritize HDR support in future titles to deliver a more visually impressive experience.</p>
