    <h2>Last Week on My Mac: Losing confidence</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The article is a personal reflection by the author on their increasing frustration and loss of confidence in using macOS, specifically Ventura and Sonoma. The author, who has been a long-time Mac user and considers themselves knowledgeable about the system, details a series of recent issues and unexpected behaviors they've encountered. These problems range from minor annoyances to more significant functional failures, leading them to question the reliability and predictability of the operating system.</p>
<p>The author describes several specific incidents that have eroded their confidence. One recurring issue involves the Finder, which has become unreliable in performing basic tasks such as copying files or displaying accurate information about files and folders. The author notes instances where the Finder reports incorrect sizes for folders, fails to copy files without explanation, or becomes unresponsive, requiring a restart. These problems are particularly concerning because the Finder is a fundamental component of the macOS user experience.</p>
<p>Another source of frustration is the increasing complexity and unreliability of iCloud integration. The author recounts problems with iCloud Drive, including files not syncing correctly and inconsistencies between what is stored locally and what is displayed in the cloud. These issues have led to data loss and required significant time and effort to resolve. The author expresses concern that iCloud, which is intended to simplify file management and data backup, has instead become a source of anxiety and potential data corruption.</p>
<p>The author also mentions problems with system updates and background processes. They describe situations where updates have introduced new bugs or broken existing functionality, forcing them to revert to older versions of the operating system. Additionally, they note that background processes often consume excessive system resources, leading to performance slowdowns and unexpected battery drain. These issues suggest that macOS has become increasingly complex and difficult to manage, even for experienced users.</p>
<p>The author's loss of confidence is further compounded by the difficulty in troubleshooting these problems. They report that traditional methods of diagnosing and resolving macOS issues, such as checking system logs or using diagnostic tools, are often ineffective. The author speculates that this is due to the increasing opacity of the operating system, which makes it harder to understand what is happening behind the scenes. They also suggest that Apple's focus on user-friendliness has come at the expense of transparency and control.</p>
<p>Overall, the article expresses a growing sense of disillusionment with macOS. The author argues that the operating system has become less reliable, more complex, and harder to troubleshoot. They worry that Apple's priorities have shifted away from the needs of experienced users, focusing instead on simplifying the user experience for newcomers. The author concludes by questioning whether macOS is still the right choice for them, given the increasing frustration and loss of productivity they have experienced.</p>
