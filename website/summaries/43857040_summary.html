<p>Onyx Boox, known for its E-Ink Android tablets, is developing a 25.3-inch color E-Ink monitor called the Mira Pro. This monitor distinguishes itself from typical LCD monitors by using E-Ink technology, which is easier on the eyes and consumes less power. The Mira Pro is geared towards professionals and creatives who require large displays and prioritize eye comfort. While not ideal for fast-paced video or gaming due to E-Ink's slower refresh rates, it excels in tasks like coding, writing, and document review where extended screen time is common.</p>

<p>The monitor features a 300 PPI (pixels per inch) display for black and white content and 150 PPI for color. It boasts a fast refresh rate for an E-Ink display, though specific numbers haven't been released. It also includes adjustable color temperature and multiple display modes to optimize the viewing experience for different tasks. Connectivity options include HDMI and DisplayPort. The Mira Pro is expected to be priced around $1,900.</p>
