<p>The article discusses MinIO's decision to remove its built-in web UI, MinIO Console, from its default builds starting July 1, 2024. The change stems from a shift in MinIO's licensing strategy. MinIO had previously licensed its object storage server under the GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 (AGPLv3), but is now transitioning to a dual license model using the Apache License Version 2.0 (ALv2) for the core server and the Business Source License (BSL) v1.1 for features like the Console.

The Business Source License allows free use under specific conditions, but it becomes fully open-source after a designated change date. In MinIO's case, the Console's source code will become available under the Apache License 2.0 four years after each version's initial release. This licensing change means that while the core MinIO server remains open-source, using the Console in a production or commercial setting requires a commercial license.

MinIO states the rationale behind this move is to ensure the sustainability of the project. By commercializing the Console, MinIO aims to generate revenue that can be reinvested into the development and maintenance of the object storage server. They argue that the Console provides significant value to enterprise users, warranting a commercial license.

The removal of the Console from default builds means that users who want to use the web UI will need to either obtain a commercial license or build it themselves from source code (until the BSL converts to ALv2). MinIO has provided instructions for building the Console from source. This change primarily affects users who rely on the web UI for managing their MinIO deployments. Command-line interface (CLI) and API access to the MinIO server remain unaffected and fully open-source under the Apache License v2.

The article also highlights the potential impact on the MinIO community. While some users may be concerned about the commercialization of a previously free feature, others may understand the need for MinIO to generate revenue to sustain development. The long-term effects of this decision on the adoption and community involvement remain to be seen. MinIO emphasizes that the core object storage functionality remains open-source and that the change is intended to improve the overall sustainability and quality of the MinIO project.

The article concludes by noting that MinIO's licensing change reflects a growing trend among open-source companies to find sustainable business models that allow them to continue developing and supporting their software. Dual licensing and the use of licenses like the BSL are becoming increasingly common as companies seek to balance open-source principles with the need for revenue generation.
