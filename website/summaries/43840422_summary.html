        <h1>The federal minimum wage is officially a poverty wage in 2025</h1>
        <p>

  <p>This article from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) discusses the inadequacy of the federal minimum wage in the United States, particularly highlighting that by 2025, it officially qualifies as a poverty wage. The author, David Cooper, points out that the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, which has remained unchanged since 2009, is significantly below the poverty threshold for a single individual working full-time.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article explains that the official poverty threshold for a single individual working full-time (2,080 hours per year) in 2024 is $15,472, which translates to an hourly wage of $7.44. Therefore, someone earning the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour is already earning less than what is needed to stay above the poverty line. The author emphasizes that due to inflation, the poverty threshold will rise in 2025, making the gap even wider.
  </p>
  <p>
   The analysis projects that the poverty threshold will be $15,734 in 2025, which means the hourly equivalent will be about $7.56. This officially makes the $7.25 federal minimum wage a poverty wage, as someone earning it will not be able to lift themselves out of poverty even if they work full-time.

   Cooper argues that the prolonged stagnation of the federal minimum wage has contributed to wage inequality and economic hardship for low-wage workers. He contrasts the federal minimum wage with the minimum wages in many states and cities, which are higher and often indexed to inflation. He notes that 30 states and the District of Columbia have minimum wages above the federal level.

   The article advocates for raising the federal minimum wage to a more livable level, such as $15 per hour, and indexing it to inflation to prevent future erosion of its value. The author suggests that such an increase would help reduce poverty, boost economic activity, and provide greater economic security for millions of low-wage workers. The article also mentions that the Raise the Wage Act, which would gradually increase the federal minimum wage to $17 by 2029, was reintroduced in Congress in 2023.
  </p>
  <p>
   In conclusion, the article highlights the urgent need for federal action to raise the minimum wage, asserting that the current rate is not only inadequate but also officially a poverty wage, failing to provide a basic standard of living for full-time workers.
