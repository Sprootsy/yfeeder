  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article announces the public preview of GitHub Copilot as a coding agent, marking a significant evolution beyond its previous role as an autocompletion tool. This update transforms Copilot into an AI-powered assistant capable of handling more complex and multi-step coding tasks within the IDE. The new features are designed to streamline the development process by allowing developers to delegate entire tasks, receive real-time assistance, and improve code quality.
  </p>
  <p>
    One key enhancement is Copilot's ability to plan and execute coding tasks autonomously. Instead of just suggesting the next line of code, Copilot can now take on broader assignments such as adding features, fixing bugs, or refactoring code. Developers can specify the desired outcome, and Copilot will generate a plan, write the necessary code, and test the changes, all while providing updates and seeking feedback. This significantly reduces the manual effort required for routine coding tasks, allowing developers to focus on higher-level problem-solving.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another important feature is real-time assistance within the IDE. Copilot now offers inline suggestions, code explanations, and debugging support directly within the code editor. This immediate feedback helps developers understand unfamiliar code, identify potential errors, and optimize their code in real-time. The integration of Copilot into the IDE aims to create a more intuitive and efficient coding environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    The updated GitHub Copilot also includes improved code quality and security checks. By leveraging advanced AI models, Copilot can identify potential vulnerabilities, suggest security best practices, and ensure code adheres to established coding standards. This proactive approach to code quality helps reduce the risk of introducing bugs or security flaws into the codebase.
  </p>
  <p>
    The public preview allows developers to test and provide feedback on these new features. GitHub is actively seeking input from the community to refine Copilot's capabilities and ensure it meets the needs of developers across different programming languages and development environments.
