    The article, titled "Talmud as Data," explores the Talmud, a central text of Rabbinic Judaism, through the lens of computer science and data analysis. It posits that the Talmud, with its intricate structure of discussions, arguments, and opinions spanning centuries, can be viewed as a vast database of legal and ethical thought. The author, Shmuel Herzfeld, discusses the unique characteristics of the Talmud that make it amenable to computational analysis. These include its highly structured format, the identification of speakers, the consistent use of technical vocabulary, and the interconnectedness of its discussions. He describes the Talmud as a 'distributed collaborative document' contributed to by many people over hundreds of years.

    Herzfeld suggests that applying computational techniques, such as network analysis and topic modeling, to the Talmud can reveal hidden patterns, connections, and insights that might be missed through traditional methods of study. He notes that the Talmud's rigorous structure, though complex, facilitates parsing and analysis. Each statement is generally attributed to a specific authority, and arguments are typically presented in a question-and-answer format. The consistent use of Aramaic and Hebrew terms provides a standardized vocabulary, and the practice of referencing previous discussions creates a dense network of interconnected ideas.

    The article also acknowledges the challenges associated with analyzing the Talmud computationally. These include the ambiguity inherent in natural language, the difficulty of resolving cross-references, and the need for sophisticated algorithms to handle the text's complexity.

    Herzfeld presents several examples of how computational analysis could be applied to the Talmud. These include tracing the evolution of specific legal concepts, identifying the key contributors to particular debates, and mapping the relationships between different topics. He envisions a future where scholars can use computational tools to explore the Talmud in new and innovative ways, uncovering hidden connections and gaining a deeper understanding of its rich intellectual history. The essay also explores some philosophical implications of thinking of the Talmud in this way.

    Herzfeld contrasts the Talmud with modern legal databases which he argues are designed for lawyers to find rulings on a specific topic, and points out that the Talmud's purpose is to present the discussion, and that sometimes there is no definitive conclusion. Herzfeld believes that these discussions can shed light on moral decision making in other areas.
