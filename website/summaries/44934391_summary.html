  <h2>Summary of Doxx</h2>
  <p>Doxx is a simple documentation generator for JavaScript projects. It's designed to be easy to use and require minimal configuration, focusing on extracting documentation directly from comments within your code. It uses Markdown for formatting and generates a single HTML page for documentation, making it easy to deploy and share.</p>

  <p>The tool parses JavaScript files, looking for specially formatted comments (JSDoc-style comments) that contain documentation for functions, classes, methods, and other code elements. These comments are then converted into HTML, creating a structured and readable documentation page. Doxx supports common JSDoc tags like <code>@param</code>, <code>@returns</code>, <code>@example</code>, and others to provide detailed information about the code.</p>
