<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The article is a blog post by Robert Harper titled "Against Software Engineering". In it, Harper argues against the elevation of software engineering to an engineering discipline comparable to civil or electrical engineering. His central thesis is that software development is fundamentally different from traditional engineering disciplines due to the nature of its materials (information vs. physical matter), the lack of well-defined physical laws, and the ever-changing requirements and environments software operates within.</p>
<p>Harper contends that software is more akin to mathematics or formal logic where correctness is paramount and verified through rigorous proofs and logical reasoning. He contrasts this with traditional engineering where approximations and tolerances are accepted due to the inherent limitations and variabilities of physical materials. In software, even a single error can lead to complete system failure, demanding a level of precision that is unattainable in physical systems.</p>
<p>The author criticizes the software engineering mindset, which he believes often prioritizes project management methodologies, team organization, and adherence to processes over a deep understanding of the underlying principles of computation and the formal properties of software systems. He suggests that the focus on these aspects often leads to a cargo cult approach, where practices are adopted without a clear understanding of their purpose or effectiveness, hindering innovation and leading to brittle and unreliable software.</p>
<p>He emphasizes the importance of formal methods, type theory, and programming language theory as the foundation for building reliable software. He advocates for software developers to be trained in these theoretical aspects of computer science, enabling them to reason precisely about the behavior of their programs and to construct software systems with a high degree of confidence in their correctness.</p>
<p>Harper believes that by embracing a more rigorous, formal approach to software development, similar to the methods employed in mathematics and logic, the field can move away from the current state of relying on testing and debugging to uncover errors and instead build systems that are correct by construction. He envisions a future where software is developed with the same level of rigor and precision as mathematical proofs, leading to more reliable and trustworthy systems.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the article proposes that software development should strive for correctness through formal methods and a deep understanding of computer science theory rather than emulating traditional engineering practices that are ill-suited to the unique nature of software.</p>
