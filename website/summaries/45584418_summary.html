     The U.S. government has imposed sanctions on a Cambodian conglomerate, Mong Reththy Group, and its owner, Mong Reththy, citing their involvement in pig butchering scams. These scams, a form of online fraud, involve building trust with victims through online relationships before defrauding them of money. The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) stated that Mong Reththy Group provided material support, including land, to entities involved in these scams in Cambodia. The sanctions aim to disrupt the operations of these criminal organizations and protect potential victims. As a result of the sanctions, all property and interests in property of Mong Reththy Group and Mong Reththy that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC.
