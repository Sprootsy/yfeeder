    <h2>Go ahead, write the “stupid” code</h2>

   <p>This article, titled "Write the Stupid Code," advocates for simplicity and directness in programming, especially in the early stages of a project. It argues against premature optimization, over-engineering, and striving for abstract or "clever" solutions before understanding the core problem and establishing a working foundation. The author emphasizes that code should be easy to read, understand, and modify, even if it means sacrificing perceived elegance or efficiency in the short term. The core idea is to prioritize getting something functional and demonstrable quickly, using straightforward and sometimes repetitive code, and then refactor and optimize later when a clearer picture of the application's requirements and performance bottlenecks emerges.</p>
   <p>The author begins by highlighting the pressure many developers feel to write code that is concise, efficient, and aesthetically pleasing from the outset. They argue that this pressure can lead to analysis paralysis, where developers spend excessive time trying to design the perfect solution before writing any actual code. This can be detrimental to progress, especially in the initial stages of a project where requirements are often uncertain and subject to change.</p>
   <p>Instead, the author proposes a "stupid code" approach, which involves writing the simplest, most obvious code that solves the immediate problem. This might involve duplicating code, using verbose variable names, and avoiding complex abstractions. The goal is to get a working prototype or minimum viable product (MVP) as quickly as possible. This allows for early testing, feedback, and validation of the core concepts.</p>
   <p>The article emphasizes that "stupid code" is not intended to be the final product. Once the basic functionality is in place and the project's direction becomes clearer, the code can be refactored to improve its structure, efficiency, and maintainability. At this point, developers have a better understanding of the real-world usage patterns and performance bottlenecks, which allows them to make more informed decisions about optimization and abstraction.</p>
   <p>The author also acknowledges that there are times when more sophisticated solutions are necessary from the beginning, particularly in performance-critical applications or when dealing with complex algorithms. However, they argue that these situations are less common than developers often assume, and that the benefits of simplicity and rapid prototyping usually outweigh the potential drawbacks of "stupid code."</p>
   <p>The article also touches on the importance of readability and maintainability. "Stupid code," by its nature, is often easier to understand and modify than highly optimized or abstract code. This can be a significant advantage in collaborative projects or when onboarding new developers.</p>
   <p>In summary, the article encourages developers to embrace simplicity and directness in their code, especially in the early stages of a project. By prioritizing functionality over elegance, developers can get a working prototype or MVP quickly, validate their ideas, and make more informed decisions about optimization and refactoring later on.</p>
