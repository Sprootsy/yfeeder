<p>Salvatore Sanfilippo, the creator of Redis, reflects on his journey after leaving Redis and the tech company he co-founded. He discusses the challenges and trade-offs of working within a company versus pursuing independent projects. Sanfilippo candidly shares his experiences of feeling disconnected from the core technical work as the company grew, and the allure of returning to hands-on coding and direct impact.</p>

<p>He begins by acknowledging that his departure might seem strange to some, given his long association with Redis. He explains that his decision stemmed from a desire to reconnect with the hands-on technical aspects of software development, which he felt were increasingly distanced from his role within the company. He enjoyed coding and building things directly, and missed the immediate feedback and sense of accomplishment that came with it.</p>

<p>Sanfilippo delves into the transition from being a core developer to a manager and leader within a growing organization. He recognizes the importance of leadership and enabling others but found that it didn't fulfill his personal need for direct technical engagement. He acknowledges that his strengths and passions lie more in individual contribution than in managing large teams or navigating corporate structures.</p>

<p>The article explores the different ways individuals can contribute to open-source projects and the trade-offs between working independently and being part of a company. He highlights that companies can provide resources and stability for open-source projects, but also acknowledges the potential for conflicts of interest and the dilution of the original vision. He emphasizes that companies prioritize shareholder value, which might not always align with the best interests of the open-source community or the project itself.</p>

<p>Sanfilippo discusses his personal feelings about the evolution of Redis within the company. While acknowledging the company's contributions to Redis's growth and adoption, he also expresses a sense of detachment from the project's direction as it became more commercially driven. He missed the early days of focused development and direct community interaction. He considered trying to create a new project from within the company, but felt this would be challenging given the existing priorities and obligations.</p>

<p>The piece also touches upon the nature of open-source work and its sustainability. Sanfilippo expresses concerns about the increasing reliance on venture capital funding in the open-source world, fearing that it could lead to a focus on short-term gains over long-term community benefit. He values projects driven by genuine passion and a desire to solve problems, rather than purely by commercial incentives.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the article is a personal reflection on career choices, the evolving nature of open-source, and the importance of finding work that aligns with one's passions and values. Sanfilippo's decision to leave was driven by a desire to return to his roots as a developer, where he could directly create and contribute to projects he believes in.</p>
