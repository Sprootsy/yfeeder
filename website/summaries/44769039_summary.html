Based on the provided URL, this leads to the website for Telo Trucks, an electric truck company. Telo Trucks is introducing a compact electric truck designed to combine the functionality of a full-size pickup with the maneuverability of a smaller vehicle.

The company emphasizes the vehicle's innovative design, maximizing interior space and utility while maintaining a small footprint.
