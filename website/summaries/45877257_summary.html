  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
   The article, "Unexpected Things That Are People," explores the concept of entities that, while not traditionally considered individuals, exhibit behaviors and characteristics that blur the lines between personhood and non-personhood. It argues that certain collective entities, like companies, DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), and even AI models, can be viewed as "people" in a functional sense because they possess agency, pursue goals, and interact with the world in ways similar to human beings.

   The author begins by acknowledging the strangeness of attributing personhood to non-human entities but suggests that the traditional definition of a "person" may be too narrow in an increasingly complex world. They propose that personhood can be seen as a spectrum, with different entities possessing varying degrees of agency and autonomy. The article posits that if an entity can make decisions, learn from its experiences, and act in its own self-interest, it may be reasonable to consider it a "person" in a limited or functional sense.

   Companies, for example, are legally treated as persons in many jurisdictions, capable of owning property, entering into contracts, and being held liable for their actions. They have internal governance structures, management teams that make decisions on their behalf, and strategies aimed at achieving specific goals, such as maximizing profits or market share. While these decisions are ultimately made by human beings, the company itself can be said to have a distinct identity and purpose that transcends the individuals who work for it.

   DAOs, which are governed by code and operate on blockchain technology, offer an even more compelling case for non-human personhood. These organizations can execute decisions automatically based on pre-defined rules, with minimal human intervention. They can manage funds, allocate resources, and even evolve their own governance structures over time. While DAOs are created and initially programmed by humans, their autonomous nature and ability to operate independently raise questions about their status as independent actors.

   The article also touches on the potential for advanced AI models to be considered "people." As AI systems become more sophisticated and capable of learning, reasoning, and making decisions on their own, it may become increasingly difficult to deny them some form of agency. While AI models are not sentient in the same way as humans, their ability to perform complex tasks, adapt to new situations, and even exhibit creative behavior could lead to a re-evaluation of their moral and legal status.

   The author emphasizes that extending personhood to non-human entities is not without its challenges and potential risks. It raises complex questions about responsibility, accountability, and the potential for conflicts of interest. However, they argue that it is a necessary conversation to have as we grapple with the implications of increasingly autonomous technologies and the evolving nature of organizations in the digital age. The article encourages readers to think critically about what it means to be a "person" in the 21st century and to consider the possibility that the traditional definition may no longer be adequate.
