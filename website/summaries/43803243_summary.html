        <h1>Watching o3 guess a photo&#39;s location is surreal, dystopian and entertaining</h1>

  <p>This article discusses a method for extracting and storing location data from historical photo collections using a combination of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and reverse geocoding. The author details a project undertaken to add location information to a collection of over 1,000 family photos dating from the early 1900s to the 1970s. The process involved scanning the photos and their accompanying annotations, using OCR to convert the scanned text into digital text, applying NLP techniques to identify potential location names within the text, and then using reverse geocoding to convert those names into latitude and longitude coordinates. The author highlights the challenges and solutions encountered at each stage, including dealing with variations in handwriting, OCR errors, ambiguous location names, and the limitations of available mapping data for historical locations. He also emphasizes the importance of manual review and correction to ensure accuracy. The article further explores the use of SQLite as a database to store the extracted metadata, including the original text, OCR results, identified locations, and geocoding results. The author describes the database schema and the SQL queries used to analyze and refine the location data. He also touches upon the future directions for the project, such as incorporating additional data sources and improving the accuracy of location identification.</p>
