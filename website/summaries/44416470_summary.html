<h3>Summary:</h3>
The article discusses the upcoming changes to the European travel landscape due to the introduction of two new systems: the Entry/Exit System (EES) and the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS). EES, expected to be implemented in autumn 2024, will automate border control for non-EU citizens, replacing passport stamping with biometric data collection (fingerprints and facial images). This system aims to enhance security and efficiency by registering travelers' entry, exit, and refusal of entry. ETIAS, slated to begin in mid-2025, is an electronic travel authorization required for citizens of over 60 countries who currently enjoy visa-free travel to the Schengen Zone. Travelers will need to apply online and pay a fee for ETIAS authorization, which will be linked to their passport and valid for three years or until the passport expires.

The article explores the potential impacts of these changes on travelers. EES could lead to longer processing times at borders initially as travelers and border staff adjust to the new procedures. There are concerns about potential privacy issues related to the collection and storage of biometric data, although EU officials emphasize the data will be securely managed and used solely for security purposes. ETIAS will add an extra layer of bureaucracy for visa-free travelers, requiring them to plan ahead and apply for authorization before their trip. However, it's expected to streamline the entry process for those who are authorized.

The piece also touches on the broader context of these changes, noting they are part of the EU's efforts to strengthen border security and manage migration. These new systems are intended to identify potential risks and prevent illegal immigration and criminal activity. While the changes may present some initial challenges, the EU hopes they will ultimately lead to a more secure and efficient travel experience for both visitors and member states. The article emphasizes the importance of travelers staying informed about the new requirements and planning their trips accordingly to avoid any unexpected delays or complications.
