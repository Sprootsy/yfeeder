<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The article discusses Japan's efforts to enhance its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, particularly in generative AI, to remain competitive in the global technology landscape. It highlights the necessity for Japan to develop its own foundational models and secure computational resources to train these models. The article points out that while Japan has strengths in hardware, such as semiconductors, it lags behind the U.S. and China in AI development due to insufficient investment and a lack of talent.</p>

<p>To address this, the Japanese government is supporting domestic companies and research institutions. For example, Japanese startup Sakana AI, founded by former Google researchers, is developing unique AI models inspired by the principles of evolution. The government is also funding projects at the University of Tokyo to create AI models that can handle multiple languages, including Japanese, which is crucial for local applications. Furthermore, the article mentions the importance of access to powerful computing infrastructure, such as GPUs, which are essential for training large AI models. The government is providing subsidies to companies to acquire these resources and promote research and development in AI.</p>

<p>The article also touches on the collaboration between industry, academia, and government to foster AI innovation. It emphasizes the need to overcome language barriers and cultural differences to attract international talent and promote open-source AI development. The piece suggests that Japan should leverage its strengths in robotics and other fields to create AI applications that are tailored to its unique needs and challenges, such as its aging population and labor shortages. Ultimately, the article conveys a sense of urgency and determination to bolster Japan's AI capabilities to ensure its economic and technological future.</p>
