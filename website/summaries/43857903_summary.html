<p>According to the Ars Technica article, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s anti-vaccine stance is rooted in a disbelief in germ theory. The article posits that Kennedy's views on medicine and public health are not simply about vaccine safety but stem from a fundamental disagreement with the established scientific understanding of how diseases are caused and spread.</p>

<p>The article traces Kennedy's skepticism toward germ theory back to his interest in alternative medicine and his association with individuals who promote unproven or disproven medical practices. It suggests that Kennedy's rejection of germ theory allows him to construct alternative explanations for diseases, often involving environmental toxins or government conspiracies, which then justify his opposition to vaccines and other public health measures.</p>

<p>The author argues that Kennedy's position is dangerous because it undermines public trust in science and medicine, potentially leading people to reject effective treatments and preventive measures. The article points out that germ theory is a cornerstone of modern medicine, and without it, the understanding of infectious diseases and the development of treatments like antibiotics and vaccines would be impossible. Kennedy's promotion of alternative explanations, without scientific backing, can have serious consequences for public health.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the article claims that Kennedy's distrust of germ theory is intertwined with his broader distrust of government and institutions. It suggests that Kennedy views public health interventions as tools of control rather than as measures to protect the population. This perspective further fuels his anti-vaccine activism and his promotion of alternative medical practices.</p>

<p>The article emphasizes that Kennedy's views are not supported by scientific evidence and that his claims about vaccines and disease causation have been repeatedly debunked by experts. It warns against the spread of misinformation and the potential harm it can cause, especially in a time of public health crises.</p>
