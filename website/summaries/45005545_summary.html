    <h2>Is 4chan the perfect Pirate Bay poster child to justify wider UK site-blocking?</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The UK government's Intellectual Property Office (IPO) has been criticized for using the case of Terry Harrison, a man who had his website blocked for allegedly infringing copyright, as an example to promote website blocking measures. Harrison's website, which featured fractal art, was blocked by several UK ISPs after a complaint from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). However, Harrison maintained that his website did not host or link to any infringing content and that the blocking was a mistake.

<p>
The IPO cited Harrison's case in a report on website blocking, arguing that it demonstrated the effectiveness of such measures in combating online copyright infringement. However, critics argue that the IPO's use of Harrison's case is misleading, as it suggests that website blocking is a precise and accurate tool, when in reality it can lead to the blocking of legitimate websites.

<p>
The article highlights concerns that website blocking can be easily abused and can have unintended consequences, such as blocking access to legitimate content and harming legitimate businesses. It also raises questions about the transparency and accountability of website blocking measures, and the lack of due process for website owners who have their sites blocked.

<p>
The Open Rights Group (ORG) has criticized the IPO's use of Harrison's case, arguing that it is "utterly inappropriate" to use the case of an innocent man to promote website blocking. The ORG has called for greater transparency and accountability in website blocking measures, and for better safeguards to protect legitimate websites from being blocked.
