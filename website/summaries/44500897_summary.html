    <h2>Cloudflare: We Will Get Google to Provide a Way to Block AI Overviews</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>The article reports on Cloudflare customers potentially blocking Google's AI Overviews (formerly known as Search Generative Experience or SGE) from scraping their content. This is happening because some website owners believe Google's AI Overviews are using their content without properly attributing it or driving traffic back to their sites. The concern is that AI Overviews answer user queries directly within Google's search results, potentially reducing the need for users to click through to the original sources. Cloudflare has noticed an increase in customers utilizing existing bot management tools to block Google's AI crawler (specifically identified as "GoogleOther-AdsBot"). While Cloudflare can't see exactly why each customer is blocking the bot, the timing and the user agent suggest a connection to concerns about Google's AI Overviews and its potential impact on website traffic. This blocking behavior highlights the growing tension between content creators and AI aggregators regarding content usage, attribution, and revenue sharing in the age of generative AI.</p>
