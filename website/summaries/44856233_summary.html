   The article discusses the anticipated capabilities of GPT-5, the next iteration of OpenAI's large language model, based on observations from individuals who have had early access. The author emphasizes that their information is second-hand and speculative, but it suggests significant advancements over GPT-4.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to the article, GPT-5 is expected to exhibit a noticeable leap in reasoning abilities. It will supposedly handle complex tasks more easily, demonstrating improved common sense and a deeper understanding of nuances. Users are reporting that GPT-5 can accomplish things that were previously impossible with earlier models.

  <p>
   One of the most notable rumored features is the introduction of "agents." Unlike the current GPT models that passively respond to prompts, agents will be able to actively pursue goals, make decisions, and execute actions independently. For instance, an agent could be instructed to plan a trip and then autonomously book flights and accommodations, manage the budget, and handle any unforeseen issues that arise. This represents a significant step towards autonomous AI systems.

   The article mentions that OpenAI is focusing on safety and security. Given the increased autonomy of GPT-5, ensuring it operates reliably and without harmful side effects is critical. The author suggests that the delay in releasing GPT-5 is related to the need for extensive testing and safety measures.

   GPT-5 is also expected to handle complex, multi-step tasks much more efficiently than previous models. This may involve the ability to decompose a complex problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems and solve each sub-problem individually, or orchestrate existing tools to perform more complex tasks.
  </p>
  <p>
   The release date of GPT-5 is uncertain, the author suggests that it is taking longer than expected, mainly due to the need to manage the increase in autonomy.
