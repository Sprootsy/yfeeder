  <p>According to an article published by Al Jazeera on September 1, 2025, a group of scholars is accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. The scholars assert that Israel's actions meet the definition of genocide under international law, pointing to a pattern of violence, destruction, and displacement targeting the Palestinian population. They cite evidence of mass killings, widespread destruction of homes and infrastructure, and the imposition of conditions designed to make life unsustainable for Palestinians in Gaza. The group emphasizes the intent behind these actions, arguing that they are aimed at eliminating or substantially reducing the Palestinian presence in the region.</p>

  <p>The scholars' report details specific incidents and policies they believe support their claim. This includes the scale and nature of military operations, the targeting of civilian areas, and the blockade imposed on Gaza, which has severely restricted access to essential resources like food, water, and medical supplies. They also highlight statements made by Israeli officials that they interpret as evidence of genocidal intent.</p>

  <p>The accusation of genocide is based on the 1948 Genocide Convention, which defines genocide as acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. The scholars argue that Israel's actions in Gaza meet this criteria, considering the scale of the violence, the targeting of a specific group (Palestinians), and the conditions of life imposed on them. They are calling for international intervention to stop what they describe as ongoing genocide and to hold Israeli leaders accountable for their actions.</p>

  <p>This is a summary based solely on the information presented in the provided Al Jazeera article from September 1, 2025. It is important to note that accusations of genocide are highly serious and controversial, and are subject to legal and political debate.</p>
