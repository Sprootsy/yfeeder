  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
   The GitHub issue #21 in the <code>geerlingguy/ollama-benchmark</code> repository discusses efforts to benchmark the performance of Ollama with different models and hardware configurations. Users are sharing their experiences, commands used for benchmarking, hardware details (CPU, GPU, RAM), and performance metrics (tokens per second). The primary goal is to understand how various factors like model size, quantization, GPU acceleration, and system resources affect the speed and efficiency of Ollama.
  </p>
  <p>
   Several users have contributed their benchmark results using different models such as <code>mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2</code>, <code>llama2:7b</code>, <code>llama2:13b</code>, and others. They report the tokens per second generated by Ollama while running specific prompts or using tools like <code>locust</code> to simulate concurrent requests. The benchmarks cover various hardware setups, including Macs with M1/M2 chips, Linux servers with different CPUs (e.g., AMD Ryzen) and GPUs (e.g., Nvidia RTX series), and cloud instances.
  </p>
  <p>
   The discussions also cover the commands used to run Ollama, including options to specify the number of threads (<code>--threads</code>), and the use of <code>locust</code> for load testing. Users are experimenting with different quantization levels (e.g., Q4_0) to see how it impacts performance versus quality. There are also observations about the impact of the initial model loading time and the subsequent inference speed.
  </p>
  <p>
   A key focus is on optimizing Ollama's performance by leveraging GPU acceleration. Users share their experiences with Nvidia GPUs, noting the performance improvements when the models are effectively utilizing the GPU. The issue also contains discussions about troubleshooting and addressing issues related to GPU usage and CUDA versions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to raw performance numbers, contributors are also sharing insights on the perceived quality of the model outputs. Some users note that while quantized models might be faster, they can sometimes produce lower-quality or nonsensical responses. Therefore, the benchmarks aim to strike a balance between speed and output quality.
