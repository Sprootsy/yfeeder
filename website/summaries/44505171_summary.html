 <h2>Summary of Frame of Preference</h2>
 <p>
 The article "Frame of Preference" explores the concept of how the way a choice is framed or presented significantly influences decision-making. It posits that individuals do not always make rational choices based on objective facts but are heavily swayed by the context, wording, and presentation of the available options. This phenomenon challenges the traditional economic assumption that people are rational actors who consistently maximize their utility.
 </p>
 <p>
 The article delves into various aspects of framing effects, starting with the observation that equivalent information, when presented differently, can lead to drastically different preferences. For example, a medical treatment described as having a "90% survival rate" is generally perceived more favorably than the same treatment described as having a "10% mortality rate," even though the underlying statistical outcome is identical. This highlights the power of positive versus negative framing.
 </p>
 <p>
 The author explains that framing effects are not merely quirks of perception but are deeply rooted in cognitive biases and psychological principles. Prospect Theory, developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, is central to understanding these biases. Prospect Theory suggests that individuals are more sensitive to potential losses than to equivalent gains. This "loss aversion" leads people to take actions to avoid losses, even if those actions are not necessarily the most rational from a purely objective standpoint.

 <p>
 The article further discusses how framing can be used to manipulate choices, both intentionally and unintentionally. Marketers, advertisers, and politicians often leverage framing techniques to influence consumer behavior and public opinion. For instance, emphasizing the potential benefits of a product while downplaying its risks or framing a political issue in a way that evokes fear or anger can significantly impact decision-making.
 </p>
 <p>
 The author also touches upon the ethical implications of framing effects. While framing can be a useful tool for communication and persuasion, it can also be used to deceive or mislead. The article argues that it is important to be aware of framing effects and to critically evaluate information before making decisions. This involves considering alternative framings and seeking out objective data to avoid being unduly influenced by biased presentations.
 </p>
 <p>
 Furthermore, the article explores the impact of framing on risk assessment and decision-making under uncertainty. It explains that people tend to be risk-averse when choices are framed in terms of potential gains but become risk-seeking when choices are framed in terms of potential losses. This inconsistency in risk preference can lead to suboptimal decisions in various contexts, such as investment, healthcare, and public policy.
 </p>
 <p>
 In conclusion, the article "Frame of Preference" provides a comprehensive overview of framing effects and their implications for decision-making. It highlights the importance of understanding cognitive biases and psychological principles in order to make more informed and rational choices. By being aware of how framing can influence our perceptions and preferences, we can better navigate the complexities of the world and avoid being manipulated by biased presentations of information.
