    <h2>A comparison of Ada and Rust, using solutions to the Advent of Code</h2>
    <div>
 <div>
  <p>This article is a detailed comparison of different Advent of Code 2023 solutions implemented in various programming languages. The author, John Perry, analyzes implementations in Python, C++, Rust, and C, focusing on performance characteristics such as execution time and memory usage. The comparison extends to different approaches for solving the same problem, highlighting the trade-offs between code conciseness, readability, and efficiency. Specific problems from the Advent of Code challenge are examined, and the implementations in each language are profiled using tools like `perf` to gain insights into CPU usage and identify bottlenecks. The author explores techniques like optimization flags in compilers, different data structures, and algorithmic variations to improve performance. The analysis covers a range of problem types, including those involving string processing, graph algorithms, and mathematical computations. The comparison also considers the development time and ease of use associated with each language, balancing raw performance against programmer productivity.</p>
