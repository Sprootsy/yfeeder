    <h2>Better Curl Saul: a lightweight API testing CLI focused on UX and simplicity</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p>The article is about a deprecated Lua library called "better-curl-saul" which is a wrapper for libcurl, aiming to provide a more convenient and Lua-idiomatic interface compared to other existing Lua curl bindings. The library emphasizes ease of use, providing features like automatic cookie handling, simplified header manipulation, and straightforward request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). It handles tasks such as setting up options, managing headers and cookies, and processing the response data. The library used the "saul" library as an FFI binding to libcurl.</p>

<p>Because the library is deprecated, it is no longer supported or maintained. Users are encouraged to explore alternative Lua curl libraries.</p>
