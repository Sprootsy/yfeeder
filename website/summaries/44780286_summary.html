  <p>According to an internal memo viewed by CNBC, Google has cut funding for around 50 diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. The decision was announced at a town hall meeting. The memo stated that Google is simplifying its DEI efforts, focusing on programs and initiatives that have the most impact. The company plans to concentrate its resources on scalable and data-driven approaches, as opposed to initiatives with limited reach or effectiveness. This restructuring is framed as an effort to ensure DEI work is sustainable and impactful for the long term. Google's DEI team will now concentrate on fewer, larger initiatives, emphasizing company-wide programs and partnerships with external organizations that can provide broad access to underrepresented groups. The memo also highlighted Google's commitment to transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement in its DEI efforts. Google has faced both internal and external pressures regarding its DEI initiatives. Some employees have criticized the company's commitment to DEI, while others have raised concerns about reverse discrimination. Amidst broader economic uncertainty and cost-cutting measures across the tech industry, Google's move reflects a strategic realignment to optimize its DEI investments. The company said it remains dedicated to DEI but is shifting its approach to maximize its impact.</p>
