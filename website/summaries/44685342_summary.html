<p>The Internet Archive, a San Francisco-based nonprofit digital library, has been designated as a federal depository library by the U.S. Government Publishing Office (GPO). This designation means the Internet Archive will now receive and preserve digital copies of government documents, ensuring permanent public access to this information. As a federal depository library, the Internet Archive joins a network of over 1,100 libraries across the country that provide free access to government information. However, unlike traditional depository libraries that primarily house physical documents, the Internet Archive focuses on preserving and providing access to digital government information. This collaboration aims to modernize and expand access to government publications in the digital age.</p>

<p>The Internet Archive's mission is to provide universal access to all knowledge. This aligns with the goals of the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP), which was established to ensure that government information is available to the public. By partnering with the GPO, the Internet Archive enhances its ability to preserve and make accessible a wide range of government documents, including reports, studies, and other publications that are essential for informed citizenship.</p>

<p>The partnership addresses the challenge of preserving government information that is increasingly born-digital. Traditional depository libraries have struggled to manage and provide access to digital documents. The Internet Archive's expertise in digital preservation and access makes it a valuable asset in ensuring that government information remains available to future generations. The designation also acknowledges the Internet Archive's role as a leader in digital archiving and its commitment to open access principles.</p>

<p>With this designation, the Internet Archive will work with the GPO to identify and acquire digital government documents for preservation. It will also develop tools and systems to make these documents easily discoverable and accessible to the public. The Internet Archive's existing infrastructure and expertise in web archiving, digital preservation, and open access make it well-suited to this task.</p>

<p>The collaboration between the Internet Archive and the GPO represents a significant step forward in ensuring the long-term preservation and accessibility of government information in the digital age. It highlights the importance of partnerships between government agencies and nonprofit organizations in addressing the challenges of digital preservation and access.</p>
