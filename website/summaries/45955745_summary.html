    <h2>Cities panic over having to release mass surveillance recordings</h2>

    The article discusses the panic among city officials in California due to a recent California Supreme Court decision, <i>Stein v. City of Irvine</i>, which compels cities to disclose emails and text messages of city officials on their private devices if these communications pertain to city business. This ruling has broad implications for transparency and accountability in local government, but it has also sparked concerns about privacy, the administrative burden of compliance, and potential security risks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before the <i>Stein v. City of Irvine</i> decision, many cities operated under the assumption that communications on private devices were not subject to public records requests. The court's ruling changes this, asserting that if a city official uses personal communication channels to conduct city business, those records are subject to the California Public Records Act (CPRA), the state's version of the Freedom of Information Act.
  </p>
  <p>
    The immediate reaction from city officials has been one of alarm. They are concerned about the sheer volume of records that could be subject to disclosure, the cost of reviewing and redacting these records, and the potential for private information to be inadvertently released. Cities are also worried about the implications for employee privacy, as personal communications unrelated to city business could potentially be caught up in the search for relevant records.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article details the different responses from various cities. Some cities are considering providing city-issued devices to all employees to keep official communications separate from personal ones. Others are exploring implementing new policies and training programs to educate employees about the requirements of the CPRA and the importance of using official channels for city business. Many cities are also grappling with the technical challenges of searching, reviewing, and redacting records on personal devices.

  <p>
    The ruling is particularly problematic for cities that have not adequately prepared for this level of transparency. The author argues that some cities have historically been resistant to public records requests and have used various tactics to avoid disclosing information. The <i>Stein v. City of Irvine</i> decision removes one of those tactics, forcing cities to confront their obligations under the CPRA.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article highlights that the ruling also brings up questions around the definition of "city business." It will be up to cities and the courts to determine what constitutes a record that is subject to disclosure. This could lead to further legal challenges and uncertainty in the future.
  </p>

    Ultimately, the author suggests that while the <i>Stein v. City of Irvine</i> decision may create headaches for city officials, it is a positive step towards greater transparency and accountability in local government. It forces cities to take their obligations under the CPRA seriously and ensures that the public has access to information about how their government operates. However, the author also acknowledges the challenges and costs associated with compliance and encourages cities to develop effective policies and procedures to manage the disclosure of records on personal devices.
