  <p>This article, written in a satirical style, is presented as a blog post from the future (October 24, 2025). The author recounts their experience of asking ChatGPT to write a blog post for them. The premise is that the author wanted a post about how AI is making people lazy, but instead of writing it themselves, they tasked ChatGPT with the job. </p>
  <p>The humor arises from the irony of using AI to complain about AI-induced laziness. The author expresses mild indignation and amusement when ChatGPT calls the request "lazy." The rest of the blog post is the verbatim output from ChatGPT, which fulfills the request by providing a fairly generic article about the potential for AI and automation to reduce human effort and potentially lead to a decline in skills and engagement. The AI-generated text explores both the potential benefits (increased leisure time, focus on creativity) and drawbacks (skill atrophy, dependence on technology) of widespread AI adoption. The author adds a brief concluding remark stating that they were too lazy to even edit the AI-generated content.</p>
