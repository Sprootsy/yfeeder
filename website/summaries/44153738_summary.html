<p>This article is about LibriVox, a project that aims to make all books in the public domain available as free audiobooks. These audiobooks are created by volunteer readers from around the world. The LibriVox catalog is extensive, offering a wide range of genres and languages. Because the recordings are made by volunteers, the audio quality and reading styles can vary, offering listeners a diverse experience. The project is entirely volunteer-driven, relying on individuals to contribute their time and skills to record, edit, and prooflisten chapters. LibriVox provides a platform for book lovers to access classic literature and other works without cost, while also offering volunteers a chance to engage with literature and contribute to a global community. All LibriVox recordings are in the public domain, meaning they can be freely distributed and used.</p>
