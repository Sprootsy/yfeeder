    A new global study highlights an alarming disappearance of freshwater resources worldwide. Led by Arizona State University (ASU) and published in Nature Sustainability, the research reveals that lakes and reservoirs are shrinking at a concerning rate, with more than half of the world's lakes and reservoirs having lost water between 1992 and 2020. The study used satellite data to measure changes in water storage across nearly two million bodies of water.

    The research identifies climate change and human water use as the primary drivers behind this decline. Warmer temperatures increase evaporation, reducing lake levels, while human activities such as irrigation and dam construction divert water away from these natural storage systems. The study emphasizes that these losses are not uniformly distributed, with certain regions experiencing more severe impacts.

    The consequences of shrinking freshwater resources are far-reaching. Lakes and reservoirs provide essential services, including drinking water, irrigation, hydroelectric power, and habitat for diverse species. Their decline threatens water security, food production, and biodiversity. The study underscores the need for improved water management strategies to mitigate these impacts and ensure sustainable water use for future generations. This includes strategies for climate change mitigation, and adapting water management to account for regional differences in water resource availability and the impacts of human activities.
