    <h2>Getting syntax highlighting wrong</h2>

<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>The article is a comprehensive critique of syntax highlighting as a tool for improving code readability and comprehension. The author argues that syntax highlighting, while seemingly helpful at first glance, often fails to live up to its promise and can even be detrimental to the coding experience.</p>

<p>The author begins by questioning the fundamental assumptions behind syntax highlighting. They argue that it often prioritizes aesthetic appeal over actual code understanding. The article claims that the primary goal of syntax highlighting seems to be making code look pretty, rather than making it easier to read and comprehend. It highlights the fact that good typography already exists and is optimized for readability, whereas syntax highlighting introduces arbitrary and often distracting colors and styles.</p>

<p>The author points out several specific problems with syntax highlighting. One major issue is the lack of standardization and consistency. Different languages, editors, and themes implement syntax highlighting in different ways, leading to a fragmented and unpredictable experience. What looks one way in one editor might look entirely different in another, making it harder to quickly understand code across different environments. The article also criticizes the fact that syntax highlighting often relies on imperfect parsing, leading to errors and inconsistencies, especially with complex or unusual code constructs. Incorrect highlighting can be misleading and can lead to programmers misinterpreting the code's meaning.</p>

<p>The article further argues that syntax highlighting can be distracting. The constant barrage of colors and styles can make it harder to focus on the actual logic and structure of the code. Instead of helping the programmer, it adds another layer of visual noise. It posits that syntax highlighting can become a crutch, preventing programmers from developing a deeper understanding of the underlying syntax and semantics of the language. By relying on color cues, programmers may not actually be reading and understanding the code itself.</p>

<p>The author proposes that a more effective approach to code readability is to focus on good typography and code formatting. Consistent indentation, meaningful variable names, and well-structured code can do more to improve comprehension than any amount of syntax highlighting. The article advocates for simpler, more minimal approaches to code presentation, prioritizing clarity and consistency over visual flair. It suggests that editors should focus on providing tools for code navigation, refactoring, and debugging, rather than relying on syntax highlighting as a primary means of enhancing readability.</p>

<p>In summary, the article challenges the conventional wisdom surrounding syntax highlighting, arguing that its benefits are often overstated and its drawbacks are frequently overlooked. It calls for a more thoughtful and critical approach to code presentation, prioritizing simplicity, consistency, and a deeper understanding of the underlying code.</p>
