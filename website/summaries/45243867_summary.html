   A study published in the journal
   <em>
    Diabetes Care
   </em>
   revealed a significant increase in cannabis use among U.S. adults with diabetes between 2005 and 2018. The study, led by Dr. Joseph Park of the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health, analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) involving over 33,000 adults, including more than 3,000 with diabetes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The research showed that cannabis use among adults with diabetes quadrupled during the study period, rising from 1.8% in 2005-2006 to 7.6% in 2017-2018.  This increase was more pronounced compared to adults without diabetes, where cannabis use increased from 6.7% to 12.6% over the same period.
  </p>
  <p>
   The study used self-reported data on cannabis use within the past 30 days.  Dr. Park noted that the increased use of cannabis could be attributed to its growing acceptance and legalization in various states for both medical and recreational purposes. He also pointed out that people with diabetes might be turning to cannabis to manage their condition, as some believe it can alleviate symptoms like pain and neuropathy.
  </p>
  <p>
   The research raises concerns about the potential implications of cannabis use on diabetes management and overall health.  Dr. Park emphasized that while some perceive benefits, the effects of cannabis on glucose control, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with diabetes are not well understood and require further investigation.
  </p>
  <p>
   The study also highlighted the need for healthcare providers to discuss cannabis use with their patients who have diabetes.  This is crucial because cannabis use can potentially interact with diabetes medications and affect blood sugar levels.  Furthermore, the researchers suggest that healthcare professionals should be aware of the increasing trend of cannabis use among individuals with diabetes to provide informed and appropriate care.
  </p>
  <p>
   In conclusion, the study underscored the substantial increase in cannabis use among U.S. adults with diabetes and calls for further research into its effects on diabetes management and overall health, along with improved communication between healthcare providers and patients regarding cannabis use.
