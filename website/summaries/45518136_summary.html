    <h2>Doctorow: American tech cartels use apps to break the law</h2>

<p>The article on LitHub, titled "How American Tech Cartels Use Apps to Break the Law," discusses how major American technology companies, referred to as "tech cartels," allegedly exploit loopholes and ambiguities in existing laws through the design and implementation of their mobile applications. It argues that these companies leverage their significant market power and technological capabilities to engage in practices that skirt legal boundaries, often at the expense of consumers, workers, and smaller competitors.

<p>
The author contends that tech companies strategically use the specific functionalities and user interfaces of their apps to create scenarios where they can avoid direct liability or regulatory scrutiny. This involves designing apps in ways that obscure the true nature of transactions, misclassify workers, or facilitate anti-competitive behavior. By doing so, these companies can reap the benefits of activities that would otherwise be illegal or subject to stricter oversight.
</p>
<p>
A key aspect of this strategy is the exploitation of legal classifications and definitions. For example, the article points out how companies in the gig economy use apps to classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees, thereby avoiding the obligations and costs associated with traditional employment. Similarly, the design of certain marketplace apps might be structured to avoid being classified as a retailer, which would subject them to different regulatory requirements.

<p>
The article also suggests that the rapid pace of technological innovation makes it difficult for lawmakers and regulators to keep up with the evolving tactics of tech companies. This regulatory lag allows companies to operate in gray areas of the law, where the legality of their actions is unclear or contested. The complexity of app-based services and the sheer volume of data generated by these platforms further complicate the task of identifying and addressing potential legal violations.

<p>
Furthermore, the author highlights the challenges of enforcing existing laws against tech companies that operate across multiple jurisdictions. These companies can take advantage of differences in legal frameworks and enforcement priorities to shield themselves from liability. The global reach of their services also makes it difficult for individual countries or states to effectively regulate their activities.
</p>
<p>
In summary, the article posits that American tech cartels are using apps as tools to circumvent the law, exploit regulatory gaps, and maintain their dominant market positions. This alleged strategy involves manipulating legal classifications, leveraging technological complexity, and exploiting jurisdictional differences to avoid accountability for potentially illegal or harmful practices.
