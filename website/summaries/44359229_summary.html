  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The Greenpeace report, "Environmental Impacts of Artificial Intelligence," investigates the often-overlooked environmental consequences of the rapidly expanding field of artificial intelligence (AI). The report highlights that while AI is frequently presented as a solution for environmental problems, its development and deployment have a significant carbon footprint and contribute to resource depletion.
  </p>
  <p>
    The study details how the energy consumption of training AI models, particularly large language models, is substantial and growing exponentially. This energy demand is primarily met by fossil fuels, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to climate change. Furthermore, the production of hardware required for AI, such as GPUs and data centers, involves the extraction of rare earth minerals and other resources, causing environmental damage through mining and processing. The report also addresses the issue of e-waste generated by the constant upgrading of AI hardware, which poses a significant challenge for responsible disposal and recycling.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond the direct impacts of energy use and resource extraction, the report examines the indirect environmental consequences of AI applications. For example, AI-powered surveillance systems can be used to monitor and control populations, potentially exacerbating existing social and environmental inequalities. The report also raises concerns about the use of AI in optimizing resource extraction, which could lead to overexploitation and further environmental degradation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The report calls for greater transparency and accountability in the AI industry, urging companies to disclose the environmental impacts of their AI models and hardware. It also advocates for the development of more energy-efficient AI algorithms and hardware, as well as the adoption of renewable energy sources to power AI infrastructure. Additionally, the report emphasizes the need for stronger regulations to address the environmental and social impacts of AI, ensuring that its development aligns with sustainability goals.
