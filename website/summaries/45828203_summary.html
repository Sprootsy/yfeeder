  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    According to sources, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) may cut air traffic by about 10% starting Friday if Congress doesn't reach a deal to prevent a partial government shutdown. This reduction aims to ensure safety with fewer staff available. The FAA is working on contingency plans as key funding for the agency is set to expire. If no agreement is reached, some agency employees will be furloughed.
