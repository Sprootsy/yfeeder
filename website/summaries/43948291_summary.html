<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Microsoft Teams is set to introduce a feature that blocks screen capture during meetings to protect sensitive information. This new capability, currently under development, aims to prevent participants from taking screenshots or screen recordings without authorization. The feature is designed to enhance confidentiality and privacy, especially in meetings where sensitive content is shared.</p>
<p>The screen capture blocking feature is part of Microsoft's broader effort to provide comprehensive security and compliance tools within its Teams platform. It is expected to be particularly useful in scenarios such as meetings discussing confidential business strategies, financial results, or personal employee data. By preventing unauthorized screen captures, organizations can reduce the risk of data leaks and maintain better control over their information.</p>
<p>While specific details about the implementation and configuration of the feature are still emerging, it is anticipated that administrators will have the ability to enable or disable screen capture blocking at the organizational or meeting level.
