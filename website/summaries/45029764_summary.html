    <h2>Michigan Supreme Court: Unrestricted phone searches violate Fourth Amendment</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
The Michigan Supreme Court has ruled that search warrants for cell phones must specifically detail what law enforcement is looking for and where they expect to find it on the device. The ruling came in the case of the People v. Moises Suarez, where Suarez was convicted of drug and firearm offenses after police searched his cell phone. The original search warrant was broad, allowing police to search the entire contents of the phone for any evidence related to drug trafficking. The Supreme Court found this warrant to be unconstitutional, stating that it violated the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.

The court emphasized that cell phones contain vast amounts of personal information, far exceeding what might be found in a typical physical search. Therefore, warrants to search them must be more precise. The ruling requires warrants to specify the particular data to be seized (e.g., specific contacts, messages, photos) and the likely location of that data on the phone (e.g., specific apps, folders). This is to prevent law enforcement from conducting a general exploratory search of a person's private information. The court reversed the lower court's decision and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion. This decision is expected to have a significant impact on how law enforcement obtains and executes cell phone search warrants in Michigan, requiring them to be much more targeted and specific.
