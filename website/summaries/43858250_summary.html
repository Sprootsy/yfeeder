    <h2>Two publishers and three authors fail to understand what &#34;vibe coding&#34; means</h2>

    The article "Not Vibe Coding" by Simon Willison critiques the trend of prioritizing a subjective sense of "vibe" over structured processes and documentation in software development. The author expresses concern about the growing influence of intuition-based coding practices, particularly in the context of AI and rapidly evolving technologies. Willison argues that while intuition and experimentation have their place, relying solely on them without a solid foundation of established software engineering principles can lead to unsustainable, unmaintainable, and ultimately unreliable code.

    The author begins by observing a shift in the software development landscape where the emphasis is increasingly placed on quickly achieving results and adapting to new technologies, sometimes at the expense of more traditional software engineering practices. This shift is partly driven by the excitement around AI and machine learning, where the nature of the technology often necessitates a more exploratory and iterative approach. However, Willison worries that this approach is becoming the default, even in areas where well-established methodologies would be more appropriate.

    He points out that the "vibe-based" approach often manifests as a lack of comprehensive documentation, minimal testing, and a general disregard for long-term maintainability. While such an approach might yield rapid initial progress, it can create significant challenges down the line. Debugging becomes harder, onboarding new team members becomes difficult, and the overall system becomes more fragile and prone to errors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Willison acknowledges that there's a balance to be struck. He doesn't advocate for rigid adherence to outdated methodologies in all situations. He recognizes the value of experimentation, rapid prototyping, and adapting to new technologies. However, he stresses the importance of having a solid foundation of software engineering principles to fall back on. This foundation includes things like writing clear and concise code, documenting important design decisions, implementing robust testing strategies, and carefully considering the long-term maintainability of the code.

    The author cautions against mistaking initial velocity for long-term productivity. While a vibe-based approach might allow developers to quickly get something up and running, it can create technical debt that will ultimately slow down development and increase the risk of failures. He argues that prioritizing maintainability and reliability, even if it means sacrificing some initial speed, is a more sustainable approach in the long run.
  </p>
  <p>
    Willison also touches on the social aspects of software development. He notes that a lack of documentation and clear processes can make it difficult for new developers to join a team and contribute effectively. This can lead to a situation where only a small group of people understand how the system works, which is not only a risk from a bus factor perspective but also limits the ability of the team to innovate and adapt to changing requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    In conclusion, the author calls for a more balanced approach to software development, one that embraces new technologies and methodologies while still upholding the core principles of good software engineering. He emphasizes the importance of documentation, testing, and maintainability, and cautions against the allure of "vibe-based" coding, which may offer short-term gains but can lead to long-term problems. The author argues that a focus on sustainability and reliability is essential for building software that can stand the test of time.
