  <h3>Summary:</h3>
  <p>
    The article discusses the integration of multimodal models into Ollama, enabling it to process images alongside text. It highlights the significance of this advancement for local AI development and outlines how users can now run, create, and share multimodal models using Ollama. The core of this capability lies in the addition of support for CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) embeddings, allowing the models to understand and relate visual content to textual prompts. The article explains how to get started with multimodal models in Ollama, using the llava-1.5 model as an example, and details the process of sending images to the model via the API or command line. It showcases several practical applications of multimodal models, including image description, visual question answering, and OCR tasks. Additionally, the article explores the creation of custom multimodal models using a MODFILE, demonstrating how to specify the CLIP model and integrate it into the model architecture. The article further touches upon sharing these custom models and future improvements, such as fine-tuning and broader model support, to make multimodal AI more accessible and powerful for local development.
