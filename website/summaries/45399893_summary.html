   The article, written as a fictional blog post from September 27, 2025, describes a global economic collapse dubbed the "Econopocalypse." The author, Cory Doctorow (writing as himself in the future), recounts the events leading up to the crisis, attributing it to the unchecked power of monopolies and the dominance of shareholder value as the sole metric of corporate success.

  <p>
   The narrative begins with a recap of the trends observed in the preceding decades, including rising income inequality, declining real wages, and the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few individuals and corporations. These trends were exacerbated by regulatory capture, where powerful companies influenced or controlled the agencies meant to oversee them. Antitrust enforcement was weakened, allowing monopolies to flourish. These monopolies, focused on maximizing shareholder returns, engaged in practices that squeezed workers, suppliers, and customers.

   The author highlights specific examples of industries dominated by monopolies. Tech companies, for example, used their market power to stifle competition, extract data, and control information flows. The healthcare industry saw prices skyrocket as a result of consolidation and regulatory loopholes. Essential services, like utilities and transportation, were increasingly privatized and operated with a focus on profit rather than public good.

   The pursuit of shareholder value led companies to prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability. They cut costs by reducing wages, benefits, and investments in research and development. They engaged in financial engineering, such as stock buybacks, to inflate stock prices, further enriching shareholders and executives at the expense of the company's long-term health. This behavior was incentivized by executive compensation packages tied to stock performance.

   The article explains that the monopolies also used their power to influence politics, lobbying for favorable laws and regulations that further entrenched their dominance. This created a feedback loop, where economic power translated into political power, which then reinforced economic power.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Econopocalypse was triggered by a series of cascading failures. As monopolies squeezed their suppliers and customers, they weakened the entire economic system. When one major company failed, it had a ripple effect, leading to bankruptcies, job losses, and a collapse in consumer demand. The financial system, already weakened by risky investments and deregulation, was unable to cope with the crisis.
  </p>
  <p>
   The author argues that the Econopocalypse was not inevitable but was the result of policy choices that prioritized the interests of a few over the well-being of society as a whole. He emphasizes the need for stronger antitrust enforcement, regulation of monopolies, and a shift away from shareholder value as the sole measure of corporate success. He suggests prioritizing stakeholder value, which considers the interests of workers, customers, suppliers, and the community, alongside shareholders.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the fictional context of 2025, the author reflects on the lessons learned from the crisis and expresses hope that future generations will learn from the mistakes of the past. He advocates for a more equitable and sustainable economic system that benefits all members of society.
