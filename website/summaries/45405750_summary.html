  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article discusses the concept of branchless programming, a technique that aims to eliminate conditional branches (if/else statements) from code to improve performance. The author starts by explaining why branches can be detrimental to performance due to branch prediction mechanisms in modern CPUs. When a CPU encounters a branch, it attempts to predict which path the code will take. If the prediction is correct, execution continues smoothly. However, if the prediction is incorrect (a branch misprediction), the CPU has to discard the work it has done along the incorrect path and restart execution from the correct path, leading to performance penalties.

    Branchless programming seeks to avoid these branch mispredictions by replacing conditional logic with alternative approaches that don't involve explicit branching. The article outlines several techniques for achieving this. One common method involves using boolean algebra and arithmetic operations to simulate conditional behavior. For example, instead of an 'if' statement that assigns a value based on a condition, the condition can be converted into a 0 or 1 value, which is then used in an arithmetic expression to select the appropriate value.

    Another approach involves using lookup tables. Instead of branching based on a condition, the condition can be used as an index into a table that contains the corresponding result. This can be particularly effective when dealing with a limited number of possible conditions.

    The article acknowledges that branchless programming is not always the best solution. It can sometimes make code less readable and harder to maintain. Additionally, the performance benefits of branchless programming depend on several factors, including the frequency of branch mispredictions, the complexity of the alternative code, and the specific hardware being used. The author notes that modern compilers are often capable of optimizing code to minimize branch mispredictions, which can reduce the need for manual branchless programming.

    Furthermore, the article points out that branchless programming can sometimes increase code size or introduce other performance bottlenecks. It emphasizes the importance of profiling and benchmarking to determine whether branchless programming is actually beneficial in a given situation.  The article also explains how to implement branchless conditional assignment, minimum/maximum calculation and absolute value calculation.
