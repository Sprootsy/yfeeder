<h3>Summary</h3>
The article "How Ice Cream Replaced Booze in the US Navy" discusses the historical shift from providing alcohol to sailors to providing ice cream. The practice of offering a daily ration of rum, beer, or whiskey to sailors dates back to the days of sail. However, this tradition led to problems with drunkenness, insubordination, and decreased efficiency.

In the 19th century, the temperance movement gained traction in the United States, advocating for the prohibition of alcohol. This movement influenced naval reformers who sought to improve the well-being and discipline of sailors. In 1862, Congress passed legislation to eliminate the spirit ration in the Navy, although a token beer ration remained. The complete abolition of alcohol from US Navy ships occurred on July 1, 1914, by order of Josephus Daniels, Secretary of the Navy.

Secretary Daniels sought to replace the alcoholic beverage with a palatable and morale-boosting alternative. After considering options like coffee and soft drinks, ice cream emerged as a popular choice among the sailors. Ice cream was seen as a refreshing treat, easily palatable, and relatively simple to produce and store on naval vessels equipped with refrigeration technology.

The introduction of ice cream coincided with advancements in refrigeration and ice-making technologies, which made it feasible to produce and store ice cream on ships. Over time, ice cream became a beloved tradition in the Navy, serving as a morale booster and a symbol of comfort and camaraderie. During World War II, the Navy commissioned the first large-scale floating ice cream parlor, a concrete barge which could produce large quantities of ice cream for sailors in the Pacific Theater.

The article concludes by highlighting the enduring legacy of ice cream in the US Navy, noting its role in promoting morale and providing a taste of home for sailors serving at sea. The switch from alcohol to ice cream reflects a broader shift in naval policy towards prioritizing the well-being and efficiency of its personnel.
