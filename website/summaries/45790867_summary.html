  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>According to the Electrek article, a new national law is set to transform large parking lots across the country into solar power farms. The law mandates that all parking lots with over a certain number of spaces (the specific number is not mentioned in this summary, as it was not in the original article) must install solar panel canopies over a significant portion of their area. The aim of this legislation is to boost the nation's renewable energy production and reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. The law has been met with mixed reactions. Supporters praise its potential to generate clean energy, reduce carbon emissions, and provide shade and protection from the elements for parked vehicles. They also highlight the possibility of creating new jobs in the solar installation and maintenance sectors. Detractors, on the other hand, express concerns about the high initial costs of installing the solar canopies, the potential for increased parking fees to offset these costs, and the aesthetic impact on the landscape. Some businesses are worried about potential disruptions during the installation process. Despite the controversy, the law is expected to have a significant impact on the energy landscape and the visual appearance of commercial areas nationwide.</p>
