    <h2>I Prefer RST to Markdown (2024)</h2>

  <p>This article expresses a preference for reStructuredText (RST) over Markdown, primarily for technical writing. The author, Hillel Wayne, argues that while Markdown's simplicity makes it initially appealing, RST's more extensive feature set and stricter standards provide significant advantages for creating complex and maintainable documentation.</p>

  <p>Wayne highlights several key areas where RST excels. Firstly, RST's explicit roles and directives offer greater control over semantic meaning and presentation. This allows for features such as cross-referencing, citations, and custom styling, which are difficult or impossible to achieve consistently in standard Markdown. He emphasizes the importance of semantic clarity in technical documentation, where precise meaning is crucial for accurate understanding.</p>

  <p>Secondly, the author praises RST's extensibility. He notes that RST can be extended with custom directives to meet specific project needs. This contrasts with Markdown, where extensions are often implemented inconsistently across different parsers, leading to portability issues. RST's well-defined extension mechanism ensures that new features can be added in a standardized and reliable manner.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, Wayne addresses the common criticism that RST is more complex to learn than Markdown. While acknowledging that RST has a steeper learning curve, he argues that the benefits of its greater expressiveness and maintainability outweigh the initial investment in learning the syntax. He suggests that the additional complexity is a worthwhile trade-off for the long-term advantages it offers.</p>

  <p>The author also points out that the strict parsing of RST leads to more consistent and predictable rendering across different tools. Markdown's looser syntax can result in variations in how documents are displayed, which can be problematic for technical documentation where accuracy and consistency are paramount.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, Wayne discusses the tooling available for RST. He mentions Sphinx, a popular documentation generator that uses RST as its primary format. Sphinx provides a rich set of features for creating professional-looking documentation, including automatic table of contents generation, index creation, and support for multiple output formats. While Markdown also has documentation generators, they often lack the comprehensive feature set of Sphinx.</p>

  <p>Finally, the article acknowledges that Markdown remains a popular choice for simple documents and informal writing. However, Wayne argues that RST is a superior choice for technical documentation, especially for projects that require complex formatting, semantic clarity, and long-term maintainability. He encourages readers to consider RST for projects where the benefits of its advanced features outweigh the initial learning curve.</p>
