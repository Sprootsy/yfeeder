 <h3>Summary</h3>
 <p>The article is a research paper published in *The Astrophysical Journal Letters* that reports the detection of CO (carbon monoxide) emission from a galaxy at redshift *z* = 7.085, named SPT0311-58. This galaxy is part of a merging galaxy system and is observed when the universe was only about 780 million years old. The detection was made using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The study focuses on analyzing the properties of the cool gas within this early galaxy.</p>
 

 <p>The observations revealed CO(6-5) emission, which is a specific rotational transition of the carbon monoxide molecule. The detection of CO emission at this high redshift is significant because it provides insights into the molecular gas content and the conditions within galaxies in the early universe. Molecular gas, particularly carbon monoxide, is a key component in the formation of stars. By studying the CO emission, astronomers can estimate the amount of molecular gas present, its temperature, and its dynamics, thereby understanding the star formation processes occurring in these distant galaxies.</p>
 

 <p>The researchers find that the merging galaxy system has a substantial amount of molecular gas, with a molecular gas mass estimated to be around 3.2 × 10<sup>10</sup> solar masses. This indicates that SPT0311-58 is a gas-rich system, capable of sustaining significant star formation. The study also estimates a gas fraction (the ratio of gas mass to the total baryonic mass) of approximately 50%, suggesting that gas dominates the baryonic content of this galaxy at this early epoch.</p>
 

 <p>Furthermore, the observations resolve the CO emission into two main components, corresponding to two galaxies within the merging system, labeled as SPT0311-58_N and SPT0311-58_S. These two components exhibit different properties, indicating that the merger is influencing the gas distribution and kinematics within the system.</p>
 

 <p>The authors compare the properties of SPT0311-58 with other high-redshift galaxies and find that it is among the most massive and gas-rich systems known at such early cosmic times. The detection and analysis of CO emission from SPT0311-58 contribute to a better understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in the early universe, highlighting the role of mergers in driving gas accretion and star formation.</p>
