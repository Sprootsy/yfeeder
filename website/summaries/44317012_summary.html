  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
   The GitHub repository "Maciek-roboblog/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor" provides a tool for monitoring the usage of Claude, an AI model developed by Anthropic, specifically focusing on code-related tasks. This tool, primarily implemented in Python, facilitates tracking and analyzing how Claude is utilized within a coding context. While the exact functionalities and specific features of the monitor are detailed within the repository's contents (code, documentation, etc.), the general purpose is to offer insights into Claude's performance and application in code generation, understanding, and manipulation.

The repository likely contains scripts or modules designed to interact with Claude's API or other access points. By logging requests, responses, and relevant metadata, the monitor allows users to collect data on various aspects of Claude's behavior. This data can then be processed and visualized to gain a better understanding of how the model is being used.

Potential key functionalities of the Claude Code Usage Monitor include:

*   **API Interaction:** Implementing the necessary code to send code-related prompts or queries to Claude.

*   **Usage Logging:** Recording details of each interaction with Claude, such as timestamps, input prompts, output code, and API response times.

*   **Cost Tracking:** Monitoring the costs associated with using Claude, which is particularly relevant if the API usage is billed based on tokens or request volume.

*   **Performance Evaluation:** Gathering metrics on Claude's performance, such as the accuracy, efficiency, or readability of generated code.

*   **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Providing tools for analyzing the collected data and generating reports or visualizations that highlight usage patterns and trends.

*   **Error Handling:** Logging and analyzing errors or failures that occur during interactions with Claude.

The documentation within the repository would typically explain how to set up the monitor, configure API keys, define usage parameters, and interpret the collected data. The target audience for this tool is likely developers, researchers, or organizations that heavily rely on Claude for code-related tasks and want to gain a deeper understanding of its usage and performance. By actively monitoring Claude's usage, users can identify areas for improvement, optimize their prompts, and potentially reduce costs.

In essence, the Claude Code Usage Monitor serves as a valuable instrument for those seeking to maximize the benefits of Claude in a coding environment, ensuring that the model is employed efficiently and effectively.
