    The article "The Fed Lied" by Calvin analyzes the Federal Reserve's (Fed) communication and actions regarding inflation, particularly in the period following the COVID-19 pandemic. The author argues that the Fed initially downplayed the risk of inflation, characterizing it as "transitory," and then later pivoted to a more aggressive stance to combat it. The article scrutinizes the Fed's explanations for these shifts, suggesting they were misleading and lacked transparency.

    Calvin contends that the Fed's low-interest-rate policies and quantitative easing (QE) measures, implemented to stimulate the economy during the pandemic, significantly contributed to the surge in inflation. The author points out that the Fed continued these policies even as signs of rising inflation became apparent, which they see as a critical error. The article also highlights the Fed's dual mandate of maintaining price stability and full employment, suggesting that the Fed prioritized employment over price stability, leading to the inflationary environment.

    The author criticizes the Fed's communication strategy, arguing that the "transitory" narrative was used to avoid taking early action against inflation. The author also highlights the lag time between the Fed acknowledging the inflation problem and implementing effective measures, resulting in a more aggressive response later on, which increased the risk of a recession. The article suggests that the Fed's credibility has been damaged by its handling of the inflation issue.

    In essence, the article presents a critical perspective on the Fed's actions and communication regarding inflation, accusing the Fed of misleading the public and contributing to the problem through its monetary policies.
