    <h2>Iroh: A library to establish direct connection between peers</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <p>The article is a GitHub repository README file for Iroh, a distributed storage system aiming to make data accessible, persistent, and programmable. Iroh is designed to be a suite of tools and libraries for building applications that require decentralized data storage and retrieval. It emphasizes local-first development, meaning applications can function offline and synchronize data when a network connection is available.</p>

  <p>The core concepts of Iroh include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Content Addressable Storage (CAS):</b>  Data is stored and retrieved based on its content hash, ensuring immutability and verifiability.</li>
    <li><b>Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networking:</b> Iroh utilizes a decentralized network for data distribution and synchronization, reducing reliance on centralized servers.</li>
    <li><b>Local-First Architecture:</b> Applications can access and modify data locally, with synchronization occurring in the background. This enables offline functionality and improved responsiveness.</li>
    <li><b>Programmability:</b> Iroh provides APIs and libraries that allow developers to build custom data models and application logic on top of the storage system.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The README outlines the following key features and components of Iroh:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>iroh-core:</b> The core library provides the fundamental building blocks for Iroh, including data structures, networking protocols, and storage interfaces.</li>
    <li><b>iroh-net:</b> Handles peer-to-peer networking aspects.</li>
    <li><b>iroh-store:</b> Provides local data storage.</li>
    <li><b>iroh-sync:</b> Enables synchronization between Iroh nodes.</li>
    <li><b>iroh-gateway:</b> Allows access to Iroh data via HTTP.</li>
    <li><b>iroh-js:</b> A JavaScript library for interacting with Iroh from web applications.</li>
    <li><b>iroh-ffi:</b> Foreign Function Interface to allow other programming languages to use Iroh.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The document details how to get started with Iroh, including instructions for building the project from source using Rust's Cargo build system. It also presents examples of how to use the Iroh command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the system, such as creating a node, adding data, and retrieving data.</p>

  <p>The project's goals are to provide a flexible and robust foundation for building a new generation of decentralized applications with a focus on user control and data sovereignty. The roadmap includes features such as data replication, advanced querying, and improved security.</p>
