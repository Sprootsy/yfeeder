  <p>This article, titled "Inverse Functions and Legendre Transformation (Part 1)", delves into the concept of inverse functions and their connection to the Legendre transformation, primarily within the context of calculus and physics. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of these topics, starting with the basics of inverse functions and building towards the more complex Legendre transformation.</p>

  <p>The article begins by revisiting the fundamental definition of a function and its inverse. It emphasizes that for a function to have an inverse, it must be bijective, meaning it must be both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). The author clarifies that not all functions possess inverses, and when a function is not bijective, it may be possible to restrict its domain to create a new function that is bijective and thus invertible.</p>

  <p>The author then explores the geometrical interpretation of inverse functions. The graph of an inverse function is a reflection of the original function across the line y = x. This geometrical perspective provides a visual understanding of the relationship between a function and its inverse.</p>

  <p>The article then moves on to discuss the derivative of an inverse function. It presents the formula for calculating the derivative of an inverse function, expressing it in terms of the derivative of the original function. This formula is crucial for many applications in calculus and physics, particularly when dealing with transformations between different sets of variables.</p>

  <p>A significant portion of the article is dedicated to illustrating these concepts with examples. These examples help solidify the reader's understanding of inverse functions and their derivatives. The author uses concrete functions to demonstrate how to find their inverses, calculate their derivatives, and interpret them geometrically.</p>

  <p>The article serves as a foundation for understanding the Legendre transformation, which will be explored in subsequent parts. It lays out the necessary groundwork by thoroughly explaining inverse functions and their properties. The author emphasizes that a firm grasp of inverse functions is essential for comprehending the Legendre transformation, a powerful tool used in various branches of physics, including thermodynamics and mechanics.</p>

  <p>In essence, this first part of the series focuses on establishing a clear understanding of inverse functions, their properties, and their derivatives. It prepares the reader for the upcoming discussion of the Legendre transformation by providing the necessary mathematical background.</p>
