    <h2>Azure hit by 15 Tbps DDoS attack using 500k IP addresses</h2>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft has reported disrupting the Aisuru botnet, which was responsible for a massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack targeting an Azure customer. The attack peaked at 15.38 terabits per second (Tbps) and utilized approximately 500,000 unique IP addresses. Aisuru, active since at least February 2024, primarily infects Redis servers by exploiting misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, allowing it to inject malicious payloads. The botnet's infrastructure spans multiple countries, including the United States, China, and others. Microsoft's investigation revealed that the botnet's operators focus on compromising Redis installations that are directly exposed to the internet without proper authentication. Once compromised, the servers are turned into bots capable of launching high-volume DDoS attacks. Microsoft has taken steps to mitigate the botnet's impact by notifying affected customers, collaborating with internet service providers (ISPs) to clean infected devices, and implementing security measures to prevent further exploitation. They emphasize the importance of securing Redis servers by following best practices such as enabling authentication, using strong passwords, and regularly patching vulnerabilities.</p>
