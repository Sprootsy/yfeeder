<h2>Summary of the Article</h2>

<p>The article "Occupational exposure to cleaning products and asthma-related symptoms among healthcare workers: A systematic review and meta-analysis" investigates the association between occupational exposure to cleaning products and the development of asthma-related symptoms among healthcare workers. It addresses a significant concern, as healthcare workers frequently use cleaning and disinfecting agents to maintain hygiene and prevent infections in healthcare settings, potentially leading to respiratory health issues. The study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing evidence on this topic by systematically reviewing and meta-analyzing relevant research.</p>

<p>The authors conducted a thorough search of several major electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase, to identify studies that examined the relationship between occupational exposure to cleaning products and asthma-related symptoms in healthcare workers. The search strategy employed specific keywords and phrases related to cleaning products, healthcare workers, and asthma to ensure a comprehensive capture of relevant literature. Studies included in the review were observational studies (cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control) that reported data on the prevalence or incidence of asthma, asthma symptoms, or related respiratory outcomes among healthcare workers exposed to cleaning products compared to a less exposed or unexposed group. The researchers excluded studies that did not focus on healthcare workers or did not provide sufficient data for quantitative analysis.</p>

<p>The quality of the included studies was assessed using established quality assessment tools, such as the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for observational studies, to evaluate the risk of bias. Data extraction was performed by multiple reviewers to ensure accuracy and consistency, with disagreements resolved through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer. Extracted data included information on study design, participant characteristics, exposure assessment methods, outcome measures, and relevant confounding factors.</p>

<p>The meta-analysis combined the results of multiple studies to estimate the overall effect of occupational exposure to cleaning products on asthma-related symptoms. The researchers used statistical methods, such as calculating pooled odds ratios (ORs) or relative risks (RRs) with corresponding confidence intervals (CIs), to quantify the strength of the association. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the I-squared statistic, and potential sources of heterogeneity were explored through subgroup analyses and meta-regression. Publication bias was examined using funnel plots and statistical tests, such as Egger's test.</p>

<p>The results of the meta-analysis indicated a significant association between occupational exposure to cleaning products and an increased risk of asthma-related symptoms among healthcare workers. Specifically, healthcare workers exposed to cleaning products had a higher prevalence of asthma, wheezing, and other respiratory symptoms compared to those with lower or no exposure. Subgroup analyses revealed that the association was consistent across different types of healthcare workers (e.g., nurses, cleaners, and other allied health professionals) and different types of cleaning products (e.g., disinfectants, detergents, and sanitizers). However, the authors noted that the strength of the association varied depending on the specific exposure assessment methods and outcome measures used in the included studies.</p>

<p>The authors discussed the potential mechanisms underlying the association between cleaning product exposure and asthma-related symptoms, including the irritant and sensitizing effects of certain chemicals found in cleaning products. They also highlighted the importance of implementing preventive measures, such as improved ventilation, the use of less hazardous cleaning products, and the provision of respiratory protective equipment, to reduce healthcare workers' exposure to cleaning agents and protect their respiratory health. The study acknowledges limitations, such as the observational nature of the included studies and the potential for residual confounding, which may limit the ability to establish causality. Furthermore, variations in exposure assessment methods and outcome definitions across studies introduced heterogeneity.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the systematic review and meta-analysis provide strong evidence that occupational exposure to cleaning products is associated with an increased risk of asthma-related symptoms among healthcare workers. The findings underscore the need for comprehensive strategies to minimize exposure and protect the respiratory health of this vulnerable occupational group.</p>
