 <h3>Summary</h3>
 <p>The article discusses the common explanation for Earth's two tidal bulges, which posits that one bulge is due to the gravitational pull of the Moon and the other is due to inertia. However, the article questions the completeness and accuracy of this explanation.</p>
 <p>The basic explanation suggests that the side of the Earth closest to the Moon experiences a stronger gravitational pull, causing the water to bulge towards the Moon. On the opposite side of the Earth, the gravitational pull is weaker, and inertia (or centrifugal force in a rotating frame of reference) causes the water to bulge away from the Moon.</p>
 <p>The author of the question expresses skepticism about the inertia argument, questioning whether inertia alone can explain the bulge on the far side of the Earth, because inertia should be equal everywhere on earth, not just on the opposite side. Furthermore, the question raises the concern that the sun also has a gravitational influence, and if only inertia made the second bulge it should be much smaller because of the sun's influence.
 </p>
 <p>The answers provided clarify and expand upon the standard explanation. They emphasize that the Earth-Moon system revolves around a common center of mass (the barycenter), which is located within the Earth but not at its center. As the Earth orbits this barycenter, every point on Earth experiences a centrifugal force. This centrifugal force is constant in magnitude and direction from the point of view of Earth. The gravitational force of the Moon on Earth varies depending on the distance from the Moon.</p>
 <p>The tidal force is the difference between the gravitational force of the Moon at a given point on Earth and the gravitational force of the Moon at the Earth's center (which is approximately equal to the centrifugal force). On the side of the Earth facing the Moon, the gravitational force is stronger than the centrifugal force, resulting in a net force towards the Moon, creating a bulge. On the opposite side of the Earth, the gravitational force is weaker than the centrifugal force, resulting in a net force away from the Moon, creating the second bulge.</p>
 <p>The answers also note that the Sun also exerts tidal forces on the Earth, although these forces are weaker than those of the Moon due to the Sun's greater distance. The interplay of the Moon's and Sun's tidal forces is what causes spring tides (when the forces align) and neap tides (when the forces are at odds).</p>
 <p>In summary, the two tidal bulges are a result of the interplay between the Moon's gravitational force (which varies depending on distance) and the centrifugal force arising from the Earth's orbit around the Earth-Moon barycenter.</p>
 <h3>Key Points</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Earth has two tidal bulges, roughly on opposite sides.</li>
  <li>The common explanation attributes one bulge to the Moon's gravity and the other to inertia/centrifugal force.</li>
  <li>The Earth-Moon system orbits a common center of mass (barycenter).</li>
  <li>The tidal force is the difference between the Moon's gravitational force at a point on Earth and the gravitational force at Earth's center (approximated by the centrifugal force).</li>
  <li>The bulge facing the Moon is due to the Moon's gravity being stronger than the centrifugal force.</li>
  <li>The bulge on the opposite side is due to the centrifugal force being stronger than the Moon's gravity.</li>
  <li>The Sun also exerts tidal forces, contributing to spring and neap tides.</li>
