<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>A sweeping multi-state operation led by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) has targeted a network suspected of using undocumented workers at Hyundai's Metaplant in Georgia. This operation is part of a larger investigation into potential criminal activity involving the employment of undocumented individuals at the plant. Raids occurred in multiple locations across Georgia and Alabama, focusing on residences and businesses allegedly connected to the scheme. Federal agents executed search warrants and detained numerous individuals, with some facing potential charges related to identity theft and harboring undocumented aliens. The investigation suggests that the network facilitated the employment of these workers, potentially exploiting them for profit. The exact number of individuals detained remains unclear, but authorities have confirmed that the operation is ongoing, and more details will be released as the investigation progresses. Hyundai has stated their full cooperation with the investigation and emphasized their commitment to compliance with all labor laws. The raids have raised questions about the vetting processes used by contractors and subcontractors involved in the Metaplant's construction. This large-scale operation underscores the federal government's focus on enforcing immigration laws and combating the exploitation of undocumented workers. The investigation continues to unfold, and the full extent of the alleged criminal activity remains under scrutiny.</p>
