    <h2>The $25k car is going extinct?</h2>

  <p>The article discusses the increasing difficulty of finding new cars priced around $25,000 in the United States. It attributes this trend to several factors, including rising production costs, increased demand for larger vehicles like SUVs and trucks, and the incorporation of advanced technology and safety features in modern vehicles.</p>

  <p>The author points out that while the nominal price of a $25,000 car might seem consistent over time, the real purchasing power of that amount has decreased significantly due to inflation. Consequently, manufacturers are less incentivized to produce vehicles at that price point because profit margins are compressed.</p>

  <p>A significant driver is the shift in consumer preference toward SUVs and trucks, which generally have higher price tags than sedans or compact cars. Automakers are responding to this demand by allocating more resources to the production of these larger vehicles, further reducing the availability of more affordable options.</p>

  <p>The increasing regulatory requirements for safety and emissions also play a role. These mandates necessitate the inclusion of advanced technologies, which add to the overall cost of vehicle production. Features like automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, and advanced infotainment systems, while desirable, contribute to the higher price points of new cars.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the article suggests that the global chip shortage, which impacted the automotive industry significantly, has exacerbated the problem by limiting production and driving up prices due to constrained supply. This shortage has particularly affected the production of smaller, less expensive vehicles, as manufacturers prioritize higher-margin models when allocating scarce resources.</p>

  <p>The author also mentions that the rising cost of raw materials, such as steel and aluminum, further contributes to the overall increase in vehicle prices. These material costs directly impact the manufacturing expenses and, consequently, the final price passed on to consumers.</p>

  <p>Finally, the article concludes that the $25,000 car is becoming increasingly rare due to a confluence of economic factors, shifting consumer preferences, and technological advancements. Finding a new vehicle at that price point requires significant compromises in terms of size, features, or brand, making it a less attractive option for many buyers.</p>
