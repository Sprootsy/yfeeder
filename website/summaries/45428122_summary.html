<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The article discusses Sora, a text-to-video model developed by OpenAI. Sora can generate realistic and imaginative videos from text instructions. It aims to be a foundation for advancements in various fields. Sora is capable of creating videos up to a minute long while maintaining visual quality and adherence to the user's prompt.</p>

<p>Sora can generate videos with intricate scenes, multiple characters, and specific types of motion. The model demonstrates a deep understanding of language, enabling it to accurately interpret prompts and generate compelling visuals. Sora is also capable of generating videos from still images and expanding existing videos.</p>

<p>The development of Sora builds upon OpenAI's previous work in generative models. It utilizes a diffusion model, which starts with random noise and gradually refines it into a coherent video. The model is trained on a massive dataset of videos and images, which allows it to learn the relationships between words and visual concepts.</p>

<p>OpenAI is taking safety precautions by red-teaming the model to identify potential risks and harms. They are also developing tools to detect videos generated by Sora. The technology will be made available to red teamers, visual artists, designers, and filmmakers to gain feedback.</p>
