<h2>Summary</h2>

The article describes BioMni, a comprehensive biomedical knowledge graph designed to enhance various tasks in the biomedical domain, such as drug discovery, disease understanding, and personalized medicine. BioMni integrates a vast amount of biomedical information from diverse sources, including scientific literature, databases, and ontologies. This integration aims to create a unified and interconnected representation of biomedical knowledge, enabling more effective knowledge discovery and reasoning.

BioMni distinguishes itself through its scale, coverage, and structure. It encompasses a wide range of biomedical entities, such as genes, proteins, diseases, drugs, pathways, and biological processes. The relationships between these entities are captured through various types of edges, representing different types of interactions and associations. The knowledge graph is built using a combination of automated extraction techniques and manual curation to ensure both breadth and accuracy.

The construction of BioMni involves several key steps. First, data is collected from numerous biomedical databases and resources, including but not limited to:

*   **NCBI databases**: Providing gene and protein information.
*   **UMLS**: Offering a unified medical language system.
*   **DrugBank**: Presenting drug-related data.
*   **GO**: Containing information about gene ontology.
*   **DisGeNet**: Representing gene-disease associations.

Next, the extracted data is preprocessed and normalized to ensure consistency and reduce redundancy. Entity recognition and linking techniques are employed to identify and map entities to standard identifiers. Relationships between entities are extracted from text using natural language processing (NLP) methods and are also derived from structured databases. Finally, the entities and relationships are integrated into a graph database, creating a coherent knowledge graph.

BioMni is designed to support a variety of applications. It can be used for:

*   **Drug repurposing**: Identifying new uses for existing drugs by analyzing the relationships between drugs, diseases, and genes.
*   **Disease gene prioritization**: Ranking candidate genes for a disease based on their connections to known disease genes and related biological processes.
*   **Pathway analysis**: Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying diseases by analyzing the pathways and networks in which disease-related genes and proteins participate.
*   **Personalized medicine**: Tailoring treatment strategies to individual patients based on their genetic profiles and disease characteristics.

The knowledge graph is evaluated through several experiments demonstrating its utility in these applications. For example, it is used to predict drug-target interactions and identify potential drug candidates for specific diseases. The results show that BioMni achieves competitive performance compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential as a valuable resource for biomedical research and development.

The article also discusses the challenges and future directions of BioMni. Challenges include maintaining the accuracy and completeness of the knowledge graph, scaling it to incorporate new data sources, and developing more sophisticated methods for knowledge extraction and reasoning. Future directions include incorporating patient-level data to enable personalized medicine applications, developing tools for interactive exploration and visualization of the knowledge graph, and integrating BioMni with other biomedical resources and tools.
