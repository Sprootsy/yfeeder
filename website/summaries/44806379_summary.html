    <h2>Meta eavesdropped on period-tracker app&#39;s users, SF jury rules</h2>

<div>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, reportedly collected sensitive data from users of a period-tracking app called Maya, even when users were assured their data would remain private. According to a complaint filed with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Meta utilized its Facebook Pixel tracking tool within the Maya app, allowing it to gather intimate details about users' health, including information related to menstruation, contraception, and pregnancy plans. This data was then allegedly used to target users with personalized advertisements. The complaint asserts that Meta did this despite Maya's explicit promises of data privacy. Privacy advocates argue that this practice is particularly concerning given the increasing legal and political sensitivities surrounding reproductive health in the United States. The data collection occurred both before and after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, raising fears about how such sensitive information could be used in states with restrictive abortion laws. Meta's use of the Facebook Pixel in this context has sparked outrage and renewed scrutiny of the company's data privacy practices, as well as the broader implications of data collection by tech companies in the realm of reproductive health. Meta claims they have measures in place to prevent health data being used for ad targeting.</p>
