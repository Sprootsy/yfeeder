<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<p>David Thomson's article "Cool Tricking" is a review of Shawn Levy's book, *Cool: How the Brain’s Hidden Quest for Cool Drives Our Economy and Shapes Our World*. Thomson examines Levy's exploration of "cool" as a cultural phenomenon, arguing that Levy's ambition to define and trace the history of cool is overly broad and ultimately unsatisfying. Thomson suggests that the book's scope is too expansive, encompassing everything from jazz music to Steve Jobs, making it difficult to pinpoint a coherent definition of cool. He critiques Levy's methodology, noting that the book relies heavily on anecdotal evidence and personal opinions rather than rigorous analysis. Thomson finds that Levy's exploration of cool lacks the necessary depth and critical examination, and that his account is ultimately shallow.</p>

<p>The review delves into the problems inherent in trying to capture "cool" within a single, all-encompassing framework. Thomson points out that cool is often subjective and context-dependent, varying across different social groups, time periods, and cultural landscapes. He observes that Levy's attempts to pin down the essence of cool result in generalizations that flatten the complex and often contradictory nature of the concept. Thomson also questions whether the relentless pursuit of cool, as described by Levy, is as pervasive and influential as the book claims. He suggests that Levy overemphasizes the role of cool in driving economic and social trends, potentially overlooking other significant factors.</p>

<p>Thomson also highlights Levy's focus on American culture and its influence on the global perception of cool. While acknowledging the significant role of the United States in shaping contemporary notions of cool, Thomson suggests that Levy's perspective is somewhat limited and fails to adequately consider alternative or dissenting viewpoints. He argues that cool is not solely a product of American ingenuity or marketing prowess, but also arises from various other cultural and historical contexts. Ultimately, Thomson implies that Levy's book provides a superficial and somewhat uncritical account of a complex and elusive phenomenon. The review suggests that cool defies easy definition and resists attempts to reduce it to a simple formula or historical narrative. Thomson finds Levy's effort ambitious but ultimately unsuccessful in capturing the multifaceted and ever-changing nature of cool.</p>
