   This article profiles Nahom Fesseha, a self-taught Ethiopian developer who created an authentication tool called Gebeta and was accepted into Y Combinator (YC). Fesseha, driven by the challenges he faced while building software in Ethiopia, specifically the lack of reliable and affordable authentication solutions, developed Gebeta to address this gap. Gebeta offers multi-factor authentication (MFA) and user management features tailored to the needs of businesses in emerging markets.

   Fesseha's journey began with teaching himself to code using online resources. He identified a significant problem: existing authentication services were either too expensive or didn't adequately support the local context, including SMS delivery issues and language support. This inspired him to build his own solution.

   Gebeta aims to provide a more accessible and reliable authentication platform for businesses in Africa and other emerging markets. It focuses on affordability, ease of integration, and features relevant to the specific challenges of these regions. The tool offers functionalities like SMS-based MFA, which is crucial where internet access is limited or unreliable, and integrates with local payment systems.

   Getting into Y Combinator is a major achievement for Fesseha and Gebeta. The article highlights the significance of this accomplishment, as it provides access to funding, mentorship, and a valuable network, which can be instrumental in scaling Gebeta and expanding its reach. The YC backing validates Fesseha's vision and the potential of his product to address a critical need in emerging markets.
