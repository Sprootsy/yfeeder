  <p>This article on viksit.substack.com discusses the process of selecting the right tools for building applications using Large Language Models (LLMs). It emphasizes that choosing the optimal tools is crucial for maximizing the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM-based projects. The article outlines a structured approach to tool selection, breaking it down into several key phases. These phases involve understanding the problem, evaluating and shortlisting tools, and experimentation. The author underscores the importance of aligning tool selection with the specific requirements and constraints of the project, such as the nature of the data, the desired performance metrics, and the available resources. Moreover, the article notes that many tools are available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, necessitating a careful evaluation process. The article also explores considerations for prompt engineering, vector databases, orchestration frameworks, and evaluation metrics. By following a systematic approach, the article suggests that developers can avoid common pitfalls and significantly improve the outcome of their LLM initiatives.</p>
