    This article discusses the importance and process of refactoring Clojure code. It emphasizes that refactoring is a continuous process of improving code without changing its external behavior, and it's crucial for maintaining code quality and preventing technical debt. The author uses a practical example to illustrate common refactoring techniques in Clojure.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article starts by highlighting the reasons why refactoring is necessary, such as improving code readability, reducing complexity, making code easier to test, and preparing code for new features. It addresses the perception of refactoring as a luxury and argues that it's an essential part of software development, especially in dynamic languages like Clojure, where the lack of static types can lead to subtle bugs and make code harder to understand over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The core of the article revolves around a specific code example: a function that calculates the price of an item based on various factors like quantity, discount codes, and customer type. The author demonstrates how this function can be refactored step-by-step to improve its structure and clarity.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first refactoring step involves extracting parts of the code into smaller, named functions. This improves readability by breaking down the complex logic into smaller, more manageable chunks. Each function is given a descriptive name that reflects its purpose, making it easier to understand what the code does at a glance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, the author introduces the use of the `->>` (thread-last) macro to further enhance readability. This macro allows for a more natural, sequential flow of data through a series of functions, making the code easier to follow.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article then discusses the importance of data structures and how choosing the right data structure can significantly impact code clarity and efficiency. The author suggests using maps to represent the different factors influencing the price calculation, making the code more flexible and easier to extend in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another key refactoring technique presented is the use of `cond->>` macro, which allows for conditional application of functions within the threading macro. This helps to simplify the code and make it more expressive.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article also emphasizes the importance of testing and advocates for writing tests before, during, and after refactoring to ensure that the code's behavior remains unchanged. The author provides examples of how to write simple tests to verify the correctness of the refactored code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, the article concludes by reiterating the benefits of refactoring, such as improved code quality, reduced maintenance costs, and increased developer productivity. It encourages developers to embrace refactoring as an integral part of their workflow and to continuously strive to improve the quality of their code.
