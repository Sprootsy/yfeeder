<h3>Summary:</h3>
The article discusses the issue of Google flagging Immich, an open-source photo and video management solution, as a "dangerous app." This classification primarily affects Android users attempting to install Immich, as Google Play Protect warns them about potential risks. The Immich team believes this is a false positive and is actively working to resolve the issue. The article details the reasons why Immich might be flagged, focusing on its capabilities, such as backing up photos and videos (potentially including sensitive content), accessing location data, and the risks associated with self-hosting (exposing the application to the internet). While acknowledging these inherent risks, the Immich team emphasizes that the application itself is secure and that the flagging is likely due to the nature of its functions rather than any malicious intent. The post outlines the steps taken to appeal Google's decision, including providing detailed information about Immich's functionality, security measures, and commitment to user privacy. It also highlights the challenges of appealing such decisions and the lack of transparency in Google's review process. The article aims to inform the Immich community about the situation, reassure them about the safety of the application, and provide guidance on how to proceed with installation despite the warning. Furthermore, it serves as a call for support from the open-source community, encouraging users to report the false positive to Google and advocate for a fair review process. It also addresses the broader implications of such flagging for open-source projects that offer functionalities similar to Immich, especially those involving data privacy and self-hosting. The team ensures continuous communication with its users, providing updates as the appeal progresses, and remains committed to ensuring a safe and positive experience for all Immich users.
