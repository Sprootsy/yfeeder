    <h2>Cool-retro-term: terminal emulator which mimics look and feel of CRTs</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <p>Cool-retro-term is a terminal emulator designed to mimic the look and feel of old cathode ray tube (CRT) screens. It aims to provide a nostalgic computing experience by recreating the visual effects associated with vintage terminals, such as screen curvature, scanlines, noise, and phosphor glow. The emulator is highly customizable, allowing users to adjust various parameters like colors, fonts, and visual effects to achieve their desired retro aesthetic.</p>

  <p>The project is built using Qt5, QML, and a custom OpenGL shader, making it cross-platform and capable of running on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Cool-retro-term is not just about visual appeal; it also functions as a fully usable terminal emulator, supporting modern terminal features and allowing users to execute commands, run programs, and interact with their system as they would with a standard terminal.</p>

  <p>Key features and customization options include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Profiles:</strong> Users can create and switch between different profiles, each with its unique set of visual settings. This allows for quickly changing the appearance of the terminal to suit different tastes or specific emulated hardware.</li>
    <li><strong>Visual Effects:</strong> Cool-retro-term provides a range of visual effects that can be toggled and adjusted, including:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>CRT curvature:</strong> Simulates the curved screen of older CRT monitors.</li>
        <li><strong>Scanlines:</strong> Recreates the horizontal lines visible on CRT screens.</li>
        <li><strong>Phosphor glow:</strong> Emulates the glow of the phosphor coating on CRT screens.</li>
        <li><strong>Flicker:</strong> Adds a subtle flicker effect to mimic the refresh rate of older displays.</li>
        <li><strong>Noise:</strong> Introduces static noise to the screen for added realism.</li>
        <li><strong>Vignette:</strong> Darkens the edges of the screen, focusing attention on the center.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Color Schemes:</strong> The emulator supports various color schemes, allowing users to choose from pre-defined palettes or create their own custom color sets to match specific vintage terminals or personal preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>Fonts:</strong> Users can select different fonts to further customize the appearance of the terminal. The choice of font can significantly impact the overall retro feel, with options ranging from monospaced fonts commonly used in older terminals to more modern fonts.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> While focused on visual effects, cool-retro-term is designed to be reasonably efficient, leveraging OpenGL for rendering the effects. Performance can be adjusted by tweaking the intensity and quality of the visual effects.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Cool-retro-term is targeted towards users who appreciate the aesthetics of vintage computer terminals and want to bring that look to their modern computing environment. It is a customizable and functional terminal emulator that balances visual appeal with usability, offering a unique and nostalgic computing experience.</p>
