    <h2>Ring cameras are about to get increasingly chummy with law enforcement</h2>

  <p>The article discusses upcoming changes to Ring cameras that will increase their integration with law enforcement. A new feature called "Neighborhood Safety Reports" will automatically share certain video clips with police, even without a specific request. These clips will include events like burglaries, thefts, and vandalism, and will be shared proactively to aid investigations. This change is raising privacy concerns as it reduces the control users have over their footage and could lead to increased surveillance.</p>
