<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The statement from the Empire State Passengers Association (ESPA) criticizes the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) for allegedly impeding progress on crucial rail projects, particularly Penn Station Access (PSA) and the extension of Metro-North service to Penn Station. The ESPA argues that the MTA's actions are costing riders time and money, delaying promised benefits, and hindering economic development in the Bronx and other regions. The core issue revolves around disagreements regarding track access fees charged by Amtrak to Metro-North for using Amtrak's Hell Gate Line into Penn Station. The ESPA claims that the MTA, under Chairman Janno Lieber, is using these disagreements as a pretext to slow down or halt the PSA project, despite the project being environmentally cleared and ready for construction. They also suggest the MTA is exaggerating the costs and complexities involved.</p>

<p>The ESPA highlights the long history of efforts to bring Metro-North service to Penn Station, emphasizing the benefits this extension would bring to underserved communities in the Bronx, providing them with better access to jobs, education, and healthcare. They accuse the MTA of prioritizing other projects, like the Second Avenue Subway extension to 125th Street, at the expense of the Penn Station Access project. This prioritization, they argue, disproportionately affects lower-income residents and communities of color in the Bronx.</p>

<p>The statement dismisses the MTA's concerns about track capacity and Amtrak's infrastructure condition as excuses. The ESPA asserts that the environmental review process thoroughly addressed capacity issues and that the MTA is responsible for maintaining its own infrastructure. They imply that the MTA is leveraging these concerns to negotiate more favorable terms with Amtrak, even if it means delaying or jeopardizing the Penn Station Access project.</p>

<p>ESPA calls on Governor Hochul and the MTA to prioritize the Penn Station Access project and ensure its timely completion. They emphasize the importance of delivering on the promises made to the communities in the Bronx and other affected areas. They also urge transparency and accountability from the MTA regarding the true costs and timelines of the project.</p>

<p>In summary, the ESPA statement expresses deep frustration with the MTA's handling of the Penn Station Access project, accusing the agency of deliberately stalling progress due to disputes with Amtrak, to the detriment of riders, communities, and economic development.</p>
