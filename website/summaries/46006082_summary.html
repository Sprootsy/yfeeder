  <p>This article announces the release of 'Free PS2 SDK', a project enabling developers to create PlayStation 2 (PS2) games using JavaScript. The SDK leverages a custom-built toolchain including a JavaScript-to-C compiler, a custom PS2 toolchain, and development libraries, allowing developers to write game logic in JavaScript. The project aims to make PS2 development more accessible by using a popular and easier-to-learn language like JavaScript, compared to the traditionally used C/C++. The SDK supports various PS2 features, including graphics, audio, and input, through its API. The announcement highlights the project's potential to unlock new possibilities for homebrew development and game creation on the PS2 platform.</p>
