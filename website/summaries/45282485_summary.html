<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<p>ABC has decided to pull "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" from its broadcast schedule indefinitely. This decision stems from Jimmy Kimmel's vocal support for the Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike, which began on May 2, 2023. Kimmel has chosen to stand in solidarity with the writers and halt production of his show. The show's hiatus will last for an undetermined amount of time. ABC plans to fill the time slot previously occupied by "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" with reruns and potentially other programming. This move reflects the broader impact of the WGA strike on the television industry, as many late-night shows and other scripted programs are facing production shutdowns or delays due to the writers' strike.</p>

<p>The WGA strike is driven by the writers' demands for better compensation, improved working conditions, and protections against the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in writing. The writers argue that the current compensation models, particularly in the streaming era, do not adequately reward their work and that they are facing increased pressure to produce more content in shorter amounts of time. They are also concerned about the potential displacement of writers by AI technologies. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents the major studios and production companies, has been negotiating with the WGA, but the two sides have so far been unable to reach an agreement.</p>

<p>The decision to remove "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" from the air underscores the seriousness of the strike and the potential for it to disrupt television schedules for an extended period. It also highlights the close relationship between late-night hosts and their writing staff, as hosts rely heavily on their writers for the creation of jokes, monologues, and other comedic content. Kimmel's support for the WGA strike is consistent with a long-standing tradition of late-night hosts using their platforms to address social and political issues.</p>
