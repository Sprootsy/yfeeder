    <h2>US Trade Court finds Trump tariffs illegal</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>A U.S. trade court has blocked former President Donald Trump's attempt to impose tariffs on goods from Mexico, Vietnam and other countries, dealing a blow to his efforts to reshape global trade policy. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled against the tariffs, which the Trump administration had justified under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, the same law used to impose tariffs on China. The court found that the administration had exceeded its authority in expanding the scope of Section 301 to apply to countries beyond China without explicit congressional authorization.</p>
<p>The lawsuits were brought by several importers who challenged the legality of the tariffs, arguing that they were imposed without proper legal basis and procedural safeguards. The importers also contended that the Trump administration had not adequately demonstrated that the targeted countries' trade practices were unfair or discriminatory, as required by Section 301. The court agreed with the importers, stating that the administration's interpretation of Section 301 was overly broad and inconsistent with the statute's original intent. The ruling effectively prevents the U.S. government from collecting tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods from the affected countries.</p>
<p>This decision has significant implications for U.S. trade policy, particularly regarding the use of Section 301 as a tool to address trade imbalances and unfair trade practices. The court's ruling underscores the importance of congressional oversight in trade matters and limits the executive branch's ability to unilaterally impose tariffs without clear statutory authority. This outcome potentially hinders future administrations from using similar strategies to pressure trading partners or protect domestic industries. The ruling is expected to be appealed, setting the stage for further legal battles over the scope of presidential power in trade policy. This decision is perceived as a win for importers and free trade advocates who argue that tariffs harm consumers and disrupt supply chains. Conversely, it is a setback for those who support using tariffs as a means to protect American jobs and industries from foreign competition.</p>
