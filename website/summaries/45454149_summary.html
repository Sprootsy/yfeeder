  <h2>Summary</h2>
 

  <p>According to a Wired article, several government employees reported that their automated "out-of-office" email replies were altered without their consent during a government shutdown. These altered messages blamed Democrats for the shutdown. The employees, who wished to remain anonymous, suspected political interference, as the changes appeared to promote a specific political viewpoint. The altered messages replaced the original out-of-office replies with a message that placed blame for the government shutdown on the Democratic Party. Some employees were able to revert their messages, while others were not. This caused concern among the employees, as it raised questions about the integrity of government communications and potential violations of rules regarding political activity. There are also questions about who ordered these changes. The article highlights the potential misuse of official communication channels for political purposes and the ethical implications of such actions. The specific government agencies affected were not identified in the article.</p>
