  <p>The article is a guide on how to customize a fresh installation of Windows 11 (version 23H2) and Edge browser to improve user experience by removing unwanted features and bloatware, tweaking settings, and installing useful applications. It focuses on decluttering the system and tailoring it to individual preferences. The author outlines a series of steps they take after performing a clean installation of Windows 11, aiming to streamline the operating system and web browser.</p>

  <p>The process begins immediately after the initial Windows setup. The author skips the OneDrive setup and proceeds directly to uninstalling pre-installed applications (bloatware) that are deemed unnecessary, such as Spotify, Disney+, TikTok, and others. The author emphasizes using Geek Uninstaller for a more thorough removal of these apps and associated files.</p>

  <p>Next, the guide addresses customizing the Start Menu and Taskbar. The author removes default pinned items, including Microsoft Store apps and widgets, and organizes them according to their personal workflow. Recommendations include unpinning everything and strategically pinning frequently used applications.</p>

  <p>The article details disabling features like the Bing search integration in the Start Menu to prevent web results from cluttering local search results. The author also disables "Search Highlights" to prevent the search box from displaying trending searches and news.</p>

  <p>File Explorer is customized by removing default folders like Documents, Pictures, Music, and Videos from "This PC" view to provide a cleaner interface. The article explains how to modify the registry to achieve this.</p>

  <p>The author also disables several features they consider intrusive or unnecessary, such as notifications from certain apps, tips and suggestions from Windows, and background apps that consume resources without providing significant benefits.</p>

  <p>The Edge browser is also subject to customization. The author removes the Bing button from the toolbar, disables the shopping features, and customizes the new tab page. They recommend using extensions like uBlock Origin for ad blocking and other privacy-focused extensions.</p>

  <p>The guide includes suggestions for installing essential applications, including a password manager (Bitwarden), a universal media player (VLC), a PDF reader (Sumatra PDF), an image editor (IrfanView), and a file archiver (7-Zip). The author emphasizes the importance of these tools for a functional and efficient computing experience.</p>

  <p>Finally, the article touches upon installing drivers and enabling features like "Controlled folder access" in Windows Security to protect against ransomware. The author also mentions using tools like O&O ShutUp10++ for further privacy tweaks and disabling telemetry.</p>
