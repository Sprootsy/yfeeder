<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The Python Package Index (PyPI) announced its intention to prohibit email addresses from the <code>inbox.ru</code> domain from being used for account registration or management, effective July 15, 2025. This decision stems from a consistent pattern of abuse originating from <code>inbox.ru</code> email addresses, including a disproportionately high volume of malicious package uploads, account takeovers, and other policy violations. Despite ongoing efforts to mitigate this abuse through methods like rate limiting, CAPTCHAs, and account suspension, the issues have persisted, leading PyPI to conclude that more drastic action is necessary. The blog post details the observed abuse patterns and explains why <code>inbox.ru</code> was specifically targeted, while acknowledging the potential impact on legitimate users. PyPI emphasizes that users currently using <code>inbox.ru</code> email addresses for their accounts will need to update their email addresses to a different domain before the prohibition takes effect to maintain access to their accounts and packages. They offer detailed instructions on how to change the email address associated with a PyPI account and provide a timeline for the change, giving users ample time to comply. The announcement also encourages users who believe their accounts were wrongly flagged to contact PyPI support for assistance. Finally, the post states that this action is not taken lightly but is deemed necessary to maintain the security and integrity of the PyPI repository for the broader Python community.
