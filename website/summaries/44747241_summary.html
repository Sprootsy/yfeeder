  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article from DocuSeal discusses how to improve website loading speed by implementing a simple technique using just six lines of HTML code. The core idea revolves around prioritizing the loading of above-the-fold content, which is the content visible to users when they first visit a webpage, without scrolling. By strategically loading this critical content first, the perceived performance and user experience can be significantly enhanced, even if the entire page hasn't fully loaded yet. The technique involves using HTML attributes such as <code>&lt;img loading="lazy"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;iframe loading="lazy"&gt;</code> to defer the loading of off-screen images and iframes until they are closer to the viewport. This approach reduces the initial loading time and bandwidth consumption, as the browser doesn't waste resources on elements that aren't immediately needed. Furthermore, the article briefly touches on other web performance optimization strategies, such as image optimization, code minification, and leveraging browser caching. However, the primary focus remains on the immediate impact achievable through lazy loading of non-critical resources using HTML.

  <h2>Key Points</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Improve website loading speed with 6 lines of HTML:</b> The article demonstrates how simple HTML attributes can significantly improve website loading speed.</li>
    <li><b>Prioritize above-the-fold content:</b> Focus on loading the content that users see immediately without scrolling to enhance perceived performance.</li>
    <li><b>Lazy loading of images and iframes:</b> Use <code>&lt;img loading="lazy"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;iframe loading="lazy"&gt;</code> to defer the loading of off-screen images and iframes.</li>
    <li><b>Reduce initial loading time:</b> Lazy loading reduces the amount of data the browser needs to download initially, resulting in faster page load times.</li>
    <li><b>Conserve bandwidth:</b> By loading images and iframes only when they are needed, lazy loading helps to conserve bandwidth, especially for users with limited data plans.</li>
    <li><b>Other optimization strategies:</b> The article mentions image optimization, code minification, and browser caching as complementary techniques for improving web performance.</li>
