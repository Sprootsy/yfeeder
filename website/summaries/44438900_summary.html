<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The article "Sun Ray Shenanigans" details a series of unfortunate events experienced by the author while trying to set up and use a Sun Ray thin client in their home. The narrative begins with the author's initial excitement at acquiring a Sun Ray 150, reminiscing about their past positive experiences with Sun Rays in a professional environment, specifically highlighting the simplicity and security benefits. However, this nostalgia quickly fades as the author encounters numerous hurdles in getting the device to function correctly at home.</p>
<p>The first challenge arises from the fact that the author no longer has access to a corporate Sun Ray server. This necessitates setting up a new server, which proves to be more complicated than anticipated. The author opts to use a Raspberry Pi 4 as the server, choosing Oracle Linux as the operating system due to its perceived compatibility and Oracle's direct involvement with Sun Ray technology. The installation of Oracle Linux is relatively straightforward, but the subsequent setup of the Sun Ray server software is fraught with difficulties.</p>
<p>The author struggles with outdated documentation and conflicting information, leading to a trial-and-error approach. One major issue is related to obtaining the necessary software packages, which are not readily available or easily installable on the chosen platform. This involves manually downloading and installing RPM packages, wrestling with dependencies, and troubleshooting configuration files.</p>
<p>Another significant problem involves the Sun Ray's firmware. The author discovers that the firmware on their Sun Ray 150 is too old to be compatible with the newer server software. This requires a firmware update, which is not a simple process and involves further research and manual intervention. The author eventually manages to update the firmware, but not without considerable effort and frustration.</p>
<p>Even after the firmware update, the author continues to encounter issues, including problems with the Sun Ray client properly registering with the server and correctly displaying the user interface. The article humorously describes the author's attempts to troubleshoot these problems, involving various configuration tweaks, network adjustments, and server restarts.</p>
<p>Throughout the article, the author expresses a mix of exasperation and determination, driven by a desire to relive the positive experiences they once had with Sun Ray technology. The article also serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the challenges of using legacy or specialized hardware in a modern home environment, especially when documentation is lacking and software support is limited. In the end the author perseveres and gets the Sun Ray working, but the journey is filled with far more headaches than anticipated.</p>
