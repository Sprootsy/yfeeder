  <p>According to research, Google's AI Overviews, which provide AI-generated summaries directly in search results, significantly reduce the number of clicks to websites. The study, conducted by Similarweb, analyzed over 6,000 keywords across various categories like e-commerce, health, and finance and found that on average, website clicks decreased by almost half (47%) when AI Overviews were present. This impact varied across different categories, with some sectors experiencing even larger declines.
  </p>
  <p>The article highlights concerns that AI Overviews could fundamentally alter the relationship between users and the web. By providing answers directly within the search results, Google potentially disincentivizes users from visiting the original sources of information, which could negatively impact website traffic and revenue for content creators and businesses.
  </p>
  <p>The research also explored the different types of queries and their impact. Informational queries, where users seek factual answers, saw the most significant drop in clicks. Transactional queries, where users intend to make a purchase, were also affected, albeit to a lesser extent. Navigation queries, where users are trying to reach a specific website, experienced the smallest impact.
  </p>
  <p>The article mentions the potential implications for the open web if AI Overviews become more prevalent. Website owners and content creators rely on traffic from search engines to sustain their operations. A significant reduction in clicks could threaten their ability to create and maintain high-quality content. It also raises questions about the long-term viability of business models that depend on search engine traffic.
  </p>
  <p>Furthermore, the study acknowledges the potential benefits of AI Overviews for users, such as quick access to information and a more efficient search experience. However, it emphasizes the need to consider the potential consequences for the broader web ecosystem.
  </p>
  <p>Finally, the article touches upon the debate surrounding Google's role as both a provider of information and a curator of the web. The rise of AI Overviews intensifies this debate, as it raises concerns about Google potentially prioritizing its own AI-generated content over the original sources of information.</p>
