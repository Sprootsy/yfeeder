<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The article is a blog post discussing the complexities and nuances of measuring and interpreting SSD write performance metrics. It highlights the author's frustration with the limitations of commonly used metrics and expresses a desire for more insightful and comprehensive ways to assess SSD write performance. The author begins by noting that simple metrics like MB/sec and IOPS, while useful, don't capture the full picture of how an SSD performs under various real-world conditions. Sustained write performance, in particular, is a key area of concern, as SSDs often exhibit high initial write speeds that degrade over time as the drive fills up and the write cache becomes saturated. The piece underscores that assessing whether an SSD is suitable to a particular use case requires an understanding of how performance varies under different conditions, and existing benchmarks often fail to provide this deeper insight. The writer suggests that improvements in reporting metrics are needed to better reflect real-world usage scenarios, especially under sustained heavy write loads.</p>

<h3>Key Points</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Traditional metrics are insufficient:</b> Simple metrics like MB/sec and IOPS are inadequate for fully understanding SSD write performance.</li>
<li><b>Sustained write performance is crucial:</b> The blog emphasizes the importance of sustained write performance, which often differs significantly from initial burst speeds.</li>
<li><b>Performance degradation:</b> SSD write speeds can degrade as the drive fills up and the write cache becomes full.</li>
<li><b>Real-world conditions matter:</b> Performance varies based on workload, queue depth, and the drive's fill level, and understanding how these conditions impact performance is vital for use case suitability.</li>
<li><b>Need for better reporting:</b> The author calls for improved metrics and reporting that better reflect real-world write performance under sustained loads.</li>
