<p>The article reports on the discovery of mosquitoes in Iceland for the first time. For many years, Iceland was one of the few places on Earth without any mosquitoes, and scientists were unsure why. Theories ranged from the chemical composition of Iceland's soil to the island's fluctuating climate. </p>

<p>Recently, a team of researchers led by entomologist Dr. Eva Hansen discovered a small population of mosquitoes in a geothermal area near Reykjavik. The mosquitoes were identified as a non-biting species closely related to those found in Greenland. The discovery has sparked debate among scientists. Some believe that climate change may have created conditions more favorable for mosquitoes to survive in Iceland, while others suggest that the mosquitoes may have been carried to the island by winds or on ships. </p>

<p>The impact of this discovery on Iceland's ecosystem is still unknown. While the species found is not known to bite humans or animals, there are concerns that other, more aggressive species could eventually follow. Local authorities are monitoring the situation and have begun to implement mosquito control measures in the affected area. The discovery has also captured the public's imagination, with many Icelanders expressing both curiosity and concern about the arrival of these new inhabitants.</p>
