The article indicates that attempts to modernize the office's IT systems have been plagued by delays and cost overruns, further exacerbating the problem.

The office's decisions regarding these new forms of creative expression will have significant implications for creators, platforms, and the public. The article points to a growing concern that the Copyright Office may not be adequately equipped to address these challenges, potentially stifling innovation and creating legal uncertainty.

It faces significant challenges in terms of its technology, leadership, and its ability to adapt to the evolving landscape of copyright law in the digital age.
