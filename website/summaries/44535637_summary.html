    <h2>ETH Zurich and EPFL to release a LLM developed on public infrastructure</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>ETH Zurich has developed a new large language model (LLM) called "SwissEval" with the primary goal of serving the public good. Unlike many LLMs developed by large tech companies, SwissEval is designed to be transparent, accountable, and aligned with Swiss values. The model prioritizes data privacy and security, and it is trained on high-quality, curated data from reliable sources to ensure accuracy and trustworthiness. Furthermore, it is specifically designed to understand and respond to queries in multiple Swiss languages, including German, French, Italian, and Romansh.
</p>
<p>The development of SwissEval addresses growing concerns about the dominance of proprietary LLMs and the potential risks associated with their use, such as biased outputs, lack of transparency, and data privacy violations. By creating an open and accessible LLM, ETH Zurich aims to foster innovation, promote digital sovereignty, and empower citizens with reliable information.
</p>
<p>SwissEval is built using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and trained on a massive dataset of text and code. The model's architecture is optimized for performance and efficiency, enabling it to handle a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including text generation, question answering, and language translation. It will be made available to researchers, developers, and the public through an open-source license, allowing for further development and customization.
</p>
<p>ETH Zurich emphasizes that SwissEval is not intended to replace existing commercial LLMs but rather to provide a complementary resource that prioritizes ethical considerations and serves the specific needs of the Swiss population. The project team is actively engaging with stakeholders from academia, industry, and government to ensure that the model is aligned with societal values and meets the highest standards of quality and safety.
</p>
<p>The development of SwissEval is part of a broader effort at ETH Zurich to promote responsible AI innovation and to address the challenges and opportunities presented by artificial intelligence. The university is committed to fostering a vibrant AI ecosystem in Switzerland and to ensuring that AI technologies are used for the benefit of society.</p>
