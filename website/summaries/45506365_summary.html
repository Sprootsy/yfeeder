 <h3>Summary</h3>
 <p>A study from the University of Surrey has found that solar energy is now the cheapest source of power in the world. The research, led by Dr. Marco Raugei, examined the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) of various energy sources, including solar, wind, nuclear, and fossil fuels, across different geographical locations and technological advancements. The study considered not only direct costs but also indirect costs such as grid connection expenses and system balancing. The findings indicate that the LCOE of solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has decreased dramatically in recent years, making it more economically competitive than traditional energy sources like coal and gas in many regions. This cost reduction is attributed to technological advancements, economies of scale, and supportive government policies. The research highlights the potential for solar energy to play a significant role in the global transition to a low-carbon energy system, contributing to climate change mitigation and energy security. It emphasizes that while intermittency remains a challenge, strategic investments in grid infrastructure, energy storage solutions, and demand-side management can help overcome these limitations and enable the large-scale deployment of solar power. Furthermore, the study suggests that the continued cost decline of solar energy, coupled with increasing concerns about the environmental impacts of fossil fuels, will further accelerate the adoption of solar PV technology worldwide.</p>
