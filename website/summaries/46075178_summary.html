<p>The article discusses concerns that the UK's Online Safety Act could lead to restrictions on VPNs (Virtual Private Networks). While the Act doesn't explicitly ban VPNs, its provisions aimed at curbing illegal content and protecting children online could inadvertently make it more difficult to use or access VPNs. The Act places responsibility on tech companies to prevent users from accessing illegal material. Critics fear that to comply, these companies might implement measures that hinder VPN usage, such as blocking VPN websites or restricting VPN traffic. This is because VPNs can be used to bypass geo-restrictions and access content that is not available in the UK, including illegal material. The Act also includes provisions that could force VPN providers to log user data or implement age verification measures, raising privacy concerns. Some worry that the UK could follow in the footsteps of countries with strict internet censorship, where VPNs are heavily restricted or banned. The article highlights the potential conflict between the goals of online safety and the preservation of online privacy and freedom. It notes that while the government has stated it doesn't intend to ban VPNs, the broad language of the Act and the pressure on tech companies to comply could lead to unintended consequences that impact VPN users. The article suggests that how the Act is implemented will be crucial in determining whether it leads to restrictions on VPNs and what impact this will have on internet users in the UK.</p>
