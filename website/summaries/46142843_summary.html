<p>Alan Dye, Apple's Vice President of Human Interface Design, is set to depart the company in early 2025, according to sources familiar with the matter. Dye has been a key figure in shaping the look and feel of Apple's software and hardware products for nearly two decades. His exit marks a significant change in Apple's design leadership.</p>

<p>Dye joined Apple in 2006 and played a crucial role in the transition from skeuomorphic designs to the flatter, more modern aesthetic that characterizes iOS and macOS today. Working closely with Jony Ive, Dye helped to define Apple's design language across its product lines, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch.</p>

<p>Following Ive's departure in 2019, Dye assumed a more prominent leadership role, co-leading the design team with Evans Hankey, the Vice President of Industrial Design. Together, they were responsible for overseeing the design of Apple's products and ensuring a cohesive user experience across the Apple ecosystem. Hankey departed Apple in 2023.</p>

<p>During his tenure, Dye championed several key design initiatives, including the development of the Apple Watch interface and the creation of accessibility features designed to make Apple products more inclusive and user-friendly for individuals with disabilities.</p>

<p>It is not immediately clear what Dye plans to do after leaving Apple. However, sources suggest that he may be interested in pursuing opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence or exploring new creative ventures.</p>

<p>Apple has not yet announced a replacement for Dye. The company is expected to conduct an internal search for a suitable candidate to fill the role. Dye's departure represents a loss of institutional knowledge and design expertise for Apple. It remains to be seen how the company will adapt to this change and who will ultimately succeed Dye in shaping the future of Apple's product design.</p>
