  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>An Amnesty International report has detailed alleged human rights violations at USP Thomson, a high-security federal prison in Illinois, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz." The report focuses on the treatment of incarcerated individuals between 2019 and 2024. Amnesty International accuses the US government of failing to meet international human rights standards in its treatment of prisoners. The report alleges that prisoners were subjected to prolonged solitary confinement, sometimes lasting years, with minimal human contact or mental stimulation. It also describes instances of excessive force used by prison staff, including beatings and the use of chemical agents, often as punishment rather than for security purposes. Concerns are raised about the lack of adequate mental health care for prisoners, particularly those in solitary confinement, exacerbating existing mental health issues and leading to self-harm and suicide attempts. The report highlights the disproportionate impact of these practices on prisoners from marginalized racial and ethnic groups. Amnesty International calls on the US government to implement reforms to end prolonged solitary confinement, ensure humane treatment of prisoners, and provide adequate mental health care.</p>
