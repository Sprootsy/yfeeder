<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>The article "Electing the Doge" on TheBallotBoy.com details the intricate and multi-staged process used to elect the Doge of Venice, the head of state of the Venetian Republic, from the 13th century onwards. The system was designed to prevent any single family or faction from seizing absolute power, incorporating elements of chance, election, and sortition (selection by lot). This complex procedure aimed to ensure a balance of power and legitimacy in the selection of their leader.</p>
<p>Initially, the process involved a broad assembly of Venetian citizens. Over time, it evolved into a more refined system involving a series of electoral colleges chosen by lot and election. The process began with the selection of electors, often 30 or 40, by a drawing of lots from the members of the Great Council (the main political body of Venice). These electors then nominated candidates, and a smaller group was chosen from among them, again by lot. This group would then elect a larger body, and the cycle of election and sortition continued.</p>
<p>A key element was the use of balls (ballots) and urns to cast votes and draw lots, often employing different colors to signify various stages or choices. The entire procedure was overseen by officials who ensured fairness and adherence to the rules. The number of electors in each stage varied, but the process always involved multiple rounds of selection, making it extremely difficult for any one individual or group to manipulate the outcome. The complex steps ensured that the Doge was chosen by a process involving both deliberation and chance.</p>
<p>The final stage typically involved a larger body of electors, often 41 members, who would finally elect the Doge. A supermajority, such as 25 out of 41 votes, was usually required to win. Once elected, the Doge was presented to the public with the phrase, "This is your Doge, if it pleases you." The Doge held the position for life but was subject to various checks and balances to prevent abuse of power.</p>
<p>The article highlights the unique nature of this electoral system, contrasting it with other forms of governance prevalent in Europe at the time, such as hereditary monarchies. The Venetian system reflected a deep-seated fear of autocracy and a commitment to republican ideals, even while concentrating power in the hands of a single individual. The elaborate process to elect the Doge was a testament to the Venetian Republic's dedication to preventing corruption and ensuring a stable government.</p>
<p>The author emphasizes that while the system may appear convoluted and inefficient by modern standards, it served its purpose for centuries, contributing to the stability and prosperity of Venice. The article paints a picture of a republic deeply committed to a balanced distribution of power, using a combination of democratic and random selection methods to choose its leader.</p>
