  <p>
    Agent-O-Rama is a new open-source library from Red Planet Labs designed to simplify the development, tracing, evaluation, and monitoring of stateful LLM agents in Java or Clojure. It addresses the complexities associated with building reliable and observable LLM agents, which often involve managing state, orchestrating tool use, and ensuring the agent behaves as expected over time. The library aims to provide a more structured and manageable approach to agent development.

    The article highlights several key features of Agent-O-Rama. First, it emphasizes the ability to define agents as stateful systems, allowing them to maintain context across multiple interactions. This state management is crucial for agents that need to remember past events or user preferences. Second, it focuses on providing robust tracing capabilities. Agent-O-Rama instruments the agent's execution, recording each step, tool invocation, and state transition. This detailed tracing allows developers to understand how the agent arrived at a particular decision and facilitates debugging and optimization. Third, the library enables comprehensive evaluation. Developers can define metrics and test cases to assess the agent's performance against specific goals or scenarios. This evaluation framework supports continuous integration and allows for iterative improvements to the agent's design. Finally, Agent-O-Rama offers monitoring tools that provide real-time insights into the agent's behavior in production. These tools can track key performance indicators, identify potential issues, and ensure the agent is operating within acceptable parameters.

    The library supports both Java and Clojure, making it accessible to a wide range of developers. It is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing Java and Clojure projects.
