<div>
  <p>The article discusses a fictional technological advancement: High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) cables made of glass. It explores the potential benefits, challenges, and implications of using glass as the primary material for transmitting electricity over long distances. The author highlights the theoretical advantages of glass, such as its superior insulation capabilities, potentially lower losses compared to traditional copper or aluminum cables, and the availability of raw materials (silica). The article also delves into the hurdles that would need to be overcome to make glass HVDC cables a reality. These challenges include developing methods for mass-producing extremely long, defect-free glass strands with the required purity; creating robust and reliable joints and connections; and addressing the inherent brittleness of glass, which makes it susceptible to damage during installation and operation. Further, the article discusses the environmental implications, including the energy requirements of glass production and the recycling potential of the material. It also speculates on the potential impact on the energy industry, including the possibility of new infrastructure projects and shifts in the geopolitical landscape as access to efficient long-distance power transmission becomes more widespread.</p>
