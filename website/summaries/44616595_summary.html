<p>This article from Email Privacy Tester details several email clients that exhibit poor privacy practices, particularly regarding the loading of remote content like images and tracking pixels. These practices can expose users to tracking by email senders, compromising their privacy. The article categorizes these clients into different levels of privacy risk based on their default behavior.</p>

<p>The article identifies email clients that automatically load remote content as being the most privacy-invasive. When an email client automatically loads images and other remotely hosted content, it sends a request to the server hosting that content. This request includes the user's IP address, the type of email client being used, and potentially other identifying information. Senders can use this information to confirm that an email address is active, track when and where an email was opened, and even correlate this data with other online activity. Email clients that fall into this category essentially provide senders with a way to monitor user behavior without explicit consent.</p>

<p>The article then describes email clients that load remote content by default, but that they can be disabled. It praises email clients that block remote content by default and require explicit user consent to load them. This approach gives users control over their privacy, allowing them to decide whether or not to reveal their information to senders.</p>

<p>The article also discusses the privacy implications of using webmail services. While webmail clients generally operate within a web browser, they still vary in their handling of remote content. Some webmail services automatically load images, while others offer settings to disable this feature. Users are encouraged to check the privacy settings of their webmail provider and configure them to block remote content by default.</p>

<p>Beyond the loading of remote content, the article touches on other privacy concerns related to email clients, such as the use of third-party trackers embedded in emails and the potential for data breaches. It emphasizes the importance of choosing an email client that prioritizes user privacy and offers features to mitigate these risks.</p>

<p>Finally, the article recommends using email clients that respect user privacy by blocking remote content by default and providing options for encrypting emails. It suggests that users take an active role in protecting their email privacy by adjusting their email client settings, using privacy-focused email services, and being cautious about the emails they open and the links they click.</p>
