  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The GitHub repository "jarulraj/periodic-table" provides a comprehensive dataset of the periodic table of elements in JSON format. This dataset includes a wide range of information about each element, such as its atomic number, symbol, name, atomic mass, electronic configuration, electronegativity, atomic radius, ionization energy, and various thermodynamic properties like melting point, boiling point, and heat capacity. The data is structured in a way that makes it easy to access and use in various applications, including educational tools, scientific software, and web applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    The repository aims to offer a standardized and easily accessible resource for element data. It covers all elements currently recognized by IUPAC, including newly synthesized elements.  The data is intended to be accurate and up-to-date, although users are advised to verify critical data with authoritative sources for research purposes. The JSON format allows for straightforward parsing and integration into different programming languages and platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to the core elemental properties, the dataset also includes information about the discoverer of each element, the year of discovery, and the element's category (e.g., alkali metal, noble gas, transition metal). This additional information provides context and historical background for each element. The repository is open-source, encouraging contributions and updates from the community to maintain its accuracy and completeness.
