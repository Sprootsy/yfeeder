  <p>The article is a humorous and speculative piece written as a blog post dated August 14, 2025, reflecting on the impact and unexpected consequences of RFC 9839, a seemingly innocuous internet standard focused on tagging internet content with mood indicators. The author, presumably a seasoned internet observer, recounts the history leading up to RFC 9839, emphasizing the initial good intentions behind it: to help users filter content based on their emotional state. The author highlights the problem of emotional manipulation and the desire to create a safer, less emotionally draining online experience as the motivation for the proposal. It suggests that the RFC initially targeted filtering mechanisms that would allow people to not view things that would put them in a negative emotional state.</p>

  <p>The author details how the implementation of RFC 9839 evolved into a dystopian reality. Initially, websites grudgingly adopted the standard, often using automated algorithms to guess the mood of their content, leading to inaccurate and often hilarious mis-categorizations. The turning point came when governments began to leverage RFC 9839 for censorship and control. Content deemed to evoke "unproductive" emotions, such as anger or dissent, was suppressed, effectively silencing opposition and manipulating public opinion. The author points out the absurdity of bureaucratic entities deciding what constitutes an "unproductive" emotion, and how they got away with this type of abuse. The author also expresses concern about the long-term psychological effects of living in an environment where emotional expression is policed and manipulated.</p>

  <p>The author further elaborates on the unintended consequences of the RFC, including the rise of "mood-laundering" services that specialize in re-tagging content to bypass censorship filters. The author also jokes about the economic consequences, such as the emergence of mood-based advertising and the commodification of emotional expression. The author laments the loss of genuine human connection and the erosion of free speech, arguing that RFC 9839, intended to improve the internet, has ultimately made it a more sterile and controlled environment. The author expresses a sense of disillusionment and highlights the dangers of well-intentioned technological solutions when applied without considering the potential for abuse and unintended consequences. The author finishes by saying that the internet has become unrecognizable, and implies that it is probably for the worst.</p>
