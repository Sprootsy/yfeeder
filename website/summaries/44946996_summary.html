    <h2>OpenMower â€“ An open source lawn mower</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<h2>Summary</h2>
The article is a technical overview of OpenMower, an open-source project aiming to provide a complete software and hardware platform for building autonomous lawn mowers. The project allows users to convert existing robot lawn mowers into more sophisticated, GPS-guided, and customizable devices. It emphasizes replacing the proprietary software and control systems of commercial robot mowers with open-source alternatives.
<br>
The OpenMower project offers a comprehensive solution, encompassing hardware design, software implementation, and detailed documentation. The core of the system is based on readily available and affordable components, such as a GPS receiver, an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), and a powerful microcontroller (ESP32). The hardware design is modular, allowing for customization and adaptation to different mower models.
<br>
The software stack is built on ROS (Robot Operating System), providing a robust framework for navigation, path planning, and motor control. The software stack includes modules for GPS-based localization, obstacle avoidance, and automatic charging. It allows advanced features like defining mowing zones, setting schedules, and remote monitoring/control through a web interface or mobile app.
<br>
The documentation covers all aspects of the project, from hardware assembly and software installation to configuration and troubleshooting. The project encourages community contributions and provides resources for developers to extend the functionality of OpenMower.
<br>
OpenMower aims to provide an alternative to expensive commercial robot lawn mowers by leveraging open-source technology. It gives users greater control over their devices and allows for customization and experimentation.
