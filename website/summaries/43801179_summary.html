<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The article is a tutorial on implementing Verlet integration for physics simulations, contrasting it with the more common Euler integration method. It emphasizes the simplicity, stability, and energy conservation properties of Verlet integration, making it suitable for games and other real-time applications. The author guides the reader through the basic principles of Verlet integration, explaining how it calculates the new position of an object based on its previous position, acceleration, and a time step. The tutorial covers position Verlet integration, which is the most common variant. The author provides a step-by-step implementation example, starting with basic concepts like updating position based on velocity and then transitioning to the core Verlet algorithm. The process involves storing the previous position of each point, calculating the new position based on the old position, current position, acceleration and squared delta time, and then updating the old position with the current position for the next iteration. The article also discusses how to implement constraints using Verlet integration, specifically focusing on distance constraints between points. The implementation involves iteratively adjusting the positions of points connected by a constraint to satisfy the desired distance. The author highlights the importance of multiple iterations for achieving stable constraint satisfaction, especially with multiple constraints. The tutorial includes a JavaScript code example to illustrate the implementation, showcasing how to create points, apply forces (like gravity), integrate positions using Verlet, and enforce distance constraints. The code example is interactive, allowing users to manipulate points and observe the effects of the simulation. The article concludes by emphasizing the advantages of Verlet integration for real-time physics simulations, particularly its stability and ease of implementation. It positions Verlet integration as a practical alternative to Euler integration, especially in scenarios where energy conservation and visual stability are important considerations.</p>
