<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The article is a tutorial about Verlet integration, a numerical method used to simulate the motion of objects. It contrasts Verlet integration with the more commonly known Euler integration, highlighting the advantages of Verlet integration, such as its stability and simplicity, especially for simulating physical systems like cloth, ropes, and particle systems. The tutorial guides the reader through implementing a basic Verlet integration system using JavaScript and HTML canvas.</p>

<p>The article begins by introducing the concept of numerical integration and explaining why it's used in game development and physics simulations. It then briefly describes Euler integration, pointing out its limitations, primarily its instability which can lead to energy gain and unrealistic simulations. The article then introduces Verlet integration as a more stable alternative.</p>

<p>The core of the tutorial involves implementing Verlet integration. The fundamental idea is that the new position of a particle is calculated based on its current position, its previous position, and the acceleration acting upon it. The article provides clear formulas and explanations for updating particle positions using this method. It emphasizes that Verlet integration inherently incorporates velocity without explicitly storing it, which can be more memory efficient.</p>

<p>The tutorial then walks through the JavaScript code required to implement a Verlet system. It covers setting up the canvas, defining a `Particle` class with attributes like position and previous position, and creating functions for updating particle positions based on Verlet integration. It also includes code for applying forces, such as gravity, to the particles. The tutorial explains how to iterate through the particles and update their positions in each frame, effectively simulating their motion.</p>

<p>A significant aspect of the tutorial is the inclusion of constraints. Constraints are used to maintain specific relationships between particles, such as fixed distances. The article provides code for implementing distance constraints, where particles are forced to remain a certain distance apart. The tutorial explains how to iteratively resolve these constraints to achieve a stable configuration.</p>

<p>The tutorial also covers optimization strategies to make the Verlet integration simulation more efficient. One such optimization is to apply the constraints multiple times per frame. The article explains that by iterating through the constraint solving process, the system can converge to a more accurate solution, resulting in a more visually appealing and stable simulation.</p>

<p>Finally, the article concludes by providing a working demo of the Verlet integration system. The demo showcases particles interacting with each other through constraints, demonstrating the principles explained throughout the tutorial. This allows the reader to see the Verlet integration method in action and experiment with the parameters to understand its behavior better.</p>
