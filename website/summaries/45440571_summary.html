  <p>The article, published on terriblesoftware.org, argues that people in the software industry should stop avoiding political discussions and engagement. The author contends that the common stance of avoiding politics in the workplace, online, and in general, is not only naive but also harmful, especially considering the significant impact the tech industry has on society and politics. The author suggests that technology is inherently political, influencing power structures and societal norms, and therefore, those creating and shaping technology should be aware of and engaged in the political implications of their work.</p>
  <p>The piece criticizes the notion that keeping politics out of tech creates a more inclusive or productive environment. Instead, it argues that avoiding political discussions often silences marginalized voices and protects the status quo, as those in positions of power benefit from the absence of critical examination of existing systems. The author posits that the idea of a neutral or apolitical tech industry is a fallacy, as technological advancements often have profound social, economic, and political consequences.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the article emphasizes the importance of understanding how technology can be used for both positive and negative purposes, citing examples of its role in surveillance, misinformation, and social control. The author advocates for a more conscious and ethical approach to software development, where tech professionals consider the potential impact of their creations on various communities and actively work to mitigate harm.</p>
  <p>The author calls for a shift in mindset within the tech industry, urging individuals to become more informed about political issues, engage in respectful dialogue, and use their skills and knowledge to advocate for positive change. This includes supporting policies and initiatives that promote social justice, privacy, and equitable access to technology. The article suggests that avoiding politics is a privilege that many cannot afford and that engaging in political discourse is a responsibility for those who have the power to shape the future of technology and its impact on society.</p>
  <p>In summary, the article passionately makes the case that the tech industry can no longer afford to remain politically neutral. It urges tech professionals to recognize the political nature of their work, engage in critical discussions, and actively work towards a more just and equitable technological future.</p>
