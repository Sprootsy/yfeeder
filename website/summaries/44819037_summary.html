<p>This is a letter from Benjamin Franklin in London to his son William Franklin, who was the Governor of New Jersey, written on August 19, 1772. In the letter, Franklin discusses a variety of topics, including family matters, political affairs, and scientific observations.</p>

<p>Franklin begins by acknowledging receipt of several letters from his son and expressing pleasure in hearing of his family's well-being. He mentions sending books, including Priestley's edition of Dr. Hartley's work. He then transitions to discussing the political climate in England, specifically concerning the King's attitude towards colonial governors. He notes that the King, although generally disposed to be civil to the governors, might make exceptions based on their behavior. Franklin advises William to maintain a good relationship with his Assembly and to avoid actions that might bring him into disfavor with the Crown.</p>

<p>Franklin delves into the growing tensions between England and the colonies, particularly regarding taxation and representation. He observes the increasing discontent in America and the growing sentiment for independence. He cautions against actions that could escalate the conflict and advocates for moderation and compromise. Franklin also mentions the possibility of war between England and other European powers, which could further complicate the situation.</p>

<p>The letter also touches on scientific matters. Franklin mentions his experiments with oil to calm troubled waters, recounting an experience at Dunkirk where he successfully used oil to reduce the size of waves. He also discusses the topic of population growth in America, noting that the population is doubling every 25 years due to early marriages and the availability of land. He suggests this rapid growth could lead to America becoming a significant power in the future.</p>

<p>Throughout the letter, Franklin offers advice to his son on how to navigate the complex political landscape and maintain his position as Governor. He emphasizes the importance of prudence, diplomacy, and understanding the perspectives of both the Crown and the colonists. He also expresses his deep concern for the well-being of his family and the future of America.</p>

<p>In closing, Franklin sends his regards to his daughter-in-law, Elizabeth, and his grandson, William Temple Franklin, and expresses his hopes for their continued health and happiness.</p>
