 <h3>Summary</h3>
 <p>California is advancing efforts to implement a new law, AB 2273, the California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act, aimed at protecting children online. This law requires online platforms to prioritize the best interests of children when designing and developing their services. It mandates that companies conduct data protection impact assessments to identify potential risks to children, implement safeguards to mitigate those risks, and refrain from using children’s personal information in ways that could be detrimental to their well-being. A significant aspect of the law involves age verification. Online platforms must estimate the age of their users and tailor the online experience accordingly, providing age-appropriate content and privacy settings. While supporters believe the law will enhance children’s safety and privacy online, critics raise concerns about the potential for privacy violations, the burden on businesses, and the effectiveness of age verification methods. The law has already faced legal challenges, with some arguing that it infringes on free speech rights. The debate continues over how to balance the protection of children with the preservation of individual freedoms and the promotion of innovation in the digital space.</p>
