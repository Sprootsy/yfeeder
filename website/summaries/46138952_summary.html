  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The article "Everyone in Seattle Hates AI" is a blog post reflecting on the author's experiences and observations regarding the reception of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and products within the Seattle tech community. The author begins by noting a prevalent skepticism and even outright hostility towards AI among their peers, which contrasts with the generally positive or at least curious attitude they encounter elsewhere, particularly in the Bay Area. This sentiment is not necessarily based on a deep understanding of AI's technical limitations or potential harms, but rather stems from a more visceral, almost emotional reaction. This negativity manifests in various ways, from expressing immediate dislike to openly mocking AI-driven products and ideas.</p>

  <p>The author explores several possible reasons for this Seattle-specific anti-AI sentiment. One contributing factor is the practical, engineer-driven culture of Seattle tech companies. Seattle is home to major tech companies that focus on infrastructure, cloud services, and practical applications, fostering a pragmatic approach that values tangible results and efficient solutions. In contrast, AI is often seen as overhyped, inefficient, and prone to producing unreliable or nonsensical outputs. The author suggests that Seattle engineers may view AI as a "solution in search of a problem," particularly in contexts where simpler, more deterministic methods could achieve the same or better results.</p>

  <p>Another key point raised in the article is the high concentration of "AI skeptics" in Seattle. Due to the nature of the technology and companies located in the area, many engineers have worked with AI and Machine Learning (ML) technologies that promised much, but ultimately failed to deliver on their promises. This negative experience has led to a distrust of AI, with many seeing it as more hype than substance. This skepticism has been reinforced by the prevalence of AI-driven products that are perceived as poorly designed, inaccurate, or outright useless, contributing to a general sense of frustration and disillusionment.</p>

  <p>The author also considers the broader societal context, acknowledging that concerns about AI's ethical implications, job displacement potential, and risks of misuse are valid and widely discussed. However, they argue that the negativity in Seattle goes beyond these concerns and includes a strong distaste for the technology itself. It is driven in large part by the lived experiences and frustrations of local engineers who have seen AI fail to live up to its promises in practical applications. This skepticism is a reaction to the perceived hype, a reflection of Seattle’s engineering culture, and a collective response to the practical limitations observed in the field of AI.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>A distinct and pervasive anti-AI sentiment exists within the Seattle tech community, contrasting with attitudes in other tech hubs like the Bay Area.</li>
    <li>This sentiment is often more emotional than rational, and is triggered by the mention of AI, rather than stemming from deep analysis.</li>
    <li>Seattle's engineer-driven culture, focused on practical and efficient solutions, contributes to skepticism towards AI, which is often seen as overhyped and inefficient.</li>
    <li>A high concentration of "AI skeptics" exists in Seattle due to past negative experiences working with AI and ML technologies that failed to deliver on their promises.</li>
    <li>The perceived poor design, inaccuracy, and uselessness of many AI-driven products have reinforced this skepticism.</li>
    <li>The anti-AI sentiment goes beyond general concerns about AI ethics and job displacement, reflecting a fundamental distrust and distaste for the technology itself.</li>
    <li>Seattle engineers' lived experiences and frustrations with AI's limitations in practical applications are a primary driver of this negative attitude.</li>
