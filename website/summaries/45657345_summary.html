<h3>Summary:</h3>
The article primarily discusses the increasing trend of states enacting laws that either restrict or expand access to abortion in the United States. It highlights the legal battles surrounding abortion rights following the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, thereby eliminating the federal constitutional right to abortion and allowing individual states to regulate or ban the procedure.

Several states have implemented near-total bans on abortion, while others have sought to protect and expand abortion access. The article details some specific state actions and legal challenges. For example, it mentions efforts to codify abortion rights into state constitutions and challenges to existing abortion bans based on state constitutional grounds.

The article also touches on the role of state supreme courts in these legal battles, as they are often the final arbiters of state constitutional law. The outcomes of these court cases can have significant implications for abortion access within individual states.
