<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>The article discusses the impressive engineering velocity achieved by a large organization, specifically mentioning processing approximately 1145 pull requests per day. It emphasizes that this high throughput is not just about the sheer number of pull requests but rather indicates a mature and well-functioning engineering culture. The article posits that such a high rate of pull request processing is a symptom of several positive underlying factors. These factors include a strong emphasis on automation, comprehensive testing, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. With robust automation in place, code changes can be reviewed, tested, and merged more quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, the high pull request volume suggests that the organization has successfully broken down large, complex tasks into smaller, manageable units. This decomposition fosters incremental development, reduces the risk associated with each change, and facilitates faster feedback loops.</p>
<p>The author also underscores the importance of a collaborative and communicative engineering environment. A high pull request rate implies that engineers are actively engaging with each other's code, providing timely feedback, and fostering a culture of shared ownership. The organization likely has established clear guidelines and conventions for code style, testing, and documentation, which streamline the review process and minimize potential conflicts. Moreover, the article suggests that effective monitoring and observability play a crucial role in maintaining such a high velocity. With real-time insights into system performance and code quality, the engineering team can quickly identify and address potential issues before they escalate.</p>
<p>The article implicitly acknowledges that achieving this level of efficiency requires significant investment in infrastructure, tools, and training. The organization has likely invested heavily in developer tooling, code review platforms, and CI/CD infrastructure to support the high pull request volume. Additionally, the engineering team has probably undergone extensive training in areas such as test-driven development, code review best practices, and automation techniques. The author cautions that simply aiming for a high pull request count is not a sufficient goal in itself. The focus should be on creating a sustainable and scalable engineering process that delivers high-quality software with minimal risk. The high pull request rate is a consequence of a well-optimized system, not the other way around.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the article uses the statistic of 1145 pull requests per day as an indicator of a mature, efficient, and collaborative engineering organization. It highlights the key enablers of this achievement, including automation, testing, CI/CD, task decomposition, communication, and monitoring. The author emphasizes that the high pull request rate is a positive outcome resulting from a focus on optimizing the overall software development process, rather than a goal in itself.</p>
