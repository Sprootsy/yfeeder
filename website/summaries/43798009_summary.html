        <h1>Programming in D: Tutorial and Reference</h1>
        <p>
<div>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The article is a comprehensive online book/tutorial about the D programming language. It covers a wide range of topics, from the very basics of D syntax and program structure to advanced features like metaprogramming, контракт programming, and concurrency. The tutorial is designed for programmers who are already familiar with other programming languages, particularly those in the C/C++/Java family, and aims to quickly bring them up to speed with D's unique features and capabilities.</p>

<p>The book begins with an introduction to D, highlighting its goals of combining the power and efficiency of C++ with the rapid development capabilities of modern languages. It then dives into the fundamental elements of D, such as data types (including primitive types, arrays, structs, and classes), operators, control flow statements, and functions. Object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces are explained in detail, demonstrating how D implements these paradigms.</p>

<p>A significant portion of the tutorial is dedicated to D's memory management system, which includes both garbage collection and manual memory management capabilities. The author elucidates how to effectively use the garbage collector and when manual memory management might be necessary for performance-critical applications. Furthermore, the book explores features like RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) which help in writing memory-safe and exception-safe code.</p>

<p>The tutorial delves into advanced topics such as templates and generic programming, showcasing D's compile-time features. It demonstrates how to use templates to write reusable and efficient code that can work with different data types. Metaprogramming techniques, including compile-time function execution and string mixins, are covered to illustrate how D can generate code at compile time, leading to optimized and highly customizable programs.</p>

<p>The book also covers contract programming, where preconditions, postconditions, and invariants are used to ensure the correctness of code. The author explains how these contracts can be used to catch bugs early in the development process and improve the overall reliability of D programs.</p>

<p>Concurrency is another key topic addressed in the tutorial. D supports multiple concurrency models, including threads, shared memory, and message passing. The book provides examples of how to use these features to write concurrent programs that can take advantage of multi-core processors.</p>

<p>Throughout the tutorial, practical examples and exercises are provided to help readers solidify their understanding of the concepts. The author emphasizes best practices and provides guidance on how to write clean, efficient, and maintainable D code. The tutorial also covers D's standard library, Phobos, highlighting its key modules and functionalities.</p>

<p>Finally, the tutorial touches upon interoperability with C and C++, explaining how D code can be integrated with existing C/C++ codebases. This is an important consideration for developers who want to leverage D's features in legacy projects or utilize existing C/C++ libraries.</p>
