<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>A jury in California has ordered NSO Group, an Israeli surveillance company, to pay WhatsApp and its parent company Meta $167 million in damages. The verdict concludes a lawsuit filed by WhatsApp against NSO Group for exploiting a vulnerability in WhatsApp to install its Pegasus spyware on the mobile devices of approximately 1,400 WhatsApp users. These users included journalists, human rights activists, and other members of civil society.</p>

<p>The lawsuit, initiated in 2019, accused NSO Group of violating US laws, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), by reverse-engineering WhatsApp and gaining unauthorized access to its systems. WhatsApp argued that NSO Group developed and distributed Pegasus, which was then used to infiltrate targeted devices via a zero-day exploit. The exploit allowed attackers to inject spyware by placing a WhatsApp call to the target; even if the call wasn't answered, the spyware could still be installed.</p>

<p>NSO Group contended that it sells its spyware only to governments for the purpose of fighting terrorism and serious crime. They argued that they should be immune from the lawsuit due to the "derivative sovereign immunity" doctrine, which protects entities acting on behalf of foreign governments. However, this argument was previously rejected by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>

<p>The jury's decision addresses the specific damages caused by NSO Group's actions. The $167 million award reflects the costs WhatsApp incurred in investigating and remediating the security breach caused by Pegasus. While this is a significant amount, it is substantially less than the $3 billion in damages WhatsApp initially sought.</p>

<p>The verdict is seen as a victory for WhatsApp and a blow to NSO Group, highlighting the legal and financial repercussions for companies involved in developing and deploying powerful surveillance tools that can be used to target individuals and undermine privacy. The ruling could also have broader implications for the surveillance industry, potentially leading to increased scrutiny and legal challenges for companies engaged in similar activities.</p>

<p>Despite the verdict, the broader legal battle may not be over. NSO Group could appeal the decision, and further litigation regarding the use of Pegasus and its impact on user privacy is possible. The case underscores the ongoing tension between national security interests, the fight against crime, and the protection of individual rights in the digital age.</p>
