<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) article, "How Cops Can Get Your Private Online Data," discusses the various ways law enforcement can access individuals' private online information, often with limited oversight or public awareness. It highlights the different legal standards required for obtaining various types of data, ranging from basic subscriber information to the content of communications.
</p>
<p>
The article explains that police can often obtain basic subscriber information, such as name, address, and phone number, with just a subpoena, which requires a lower legal standard than a warrant. More sensitive information, like the content of emails or private messages, typically requires a warrant based on probable cause. However, the EFF points out several loopholes and exceptions that allow law enforcement to circumvent these protections.

<p>
One key concern is the use of third-party doctrines, where data shared with companies like Google or Facebook is considered to be no longer private in the same way as information kept solely in one's home. This means that police may be able to obtain certain types of data from these companies with a lower legal standard than if they were directly accessing it from an individual's device. The article also discusses the Stored Communications Act (SCA), which governs how law enforcement can access electronic communications stored by service providers. The SCA has been criticized for being outdated and not adequately protecting privacy in the digital age.

The EFF emphasizes the importance of transparency and accountability in law enforcement's access to online data. They advocate for stronger legal protections for digital privacy, including requiring warrants for all types of sensitive information and reforming the Stored Communications Act. The article also encourages individuals to be aware of their rights and to take steps to protect their own privacy online, such as using encryption and choosing privacy-focused service providers. It also touches on the fact that many requests are made in secret, gagging the companies from informing their users about the requests for their data.
