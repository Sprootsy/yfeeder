  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>
    Indonesia's nuclear energy regulator, Bapeten, has identified 22 industrial plants in an industrial zone near Jakarta as contaminated with Caesium-137. The contamination was discovered following tests conducted between 2019 and 2020. The affected area is located in the Batan Indah housing complex within the Serpong industrial zone, close to Jakarta. While the permissible level of radiation is set at 1 Becquerel per gram, authorities found radiation levels as high as 91 Bq/gram in the area. The source of the contamination is believed to be from a leak in a radiation source that was used for industrial purposes. No injuries have been reported.

    Bapeten is collaborating with the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) to decontaminate the area and investigate the incident further. This involves removing contaminated soil and monitoring the health of residents. The decontamination process began in December 2019, and as of October 2023, 6,408 tons of radioactive waste have been removed from the site. The waste is being stored at BRIN's nuclear waste storage facility in Serpong. Bapeten is also conducting compliance evaluations on companies in the area that handle radioactive materials to prevent similar incidents in the future.

    The Indonesian government is taking the situation seriously and is committed to ensuring the safety of the public and the environment. Bapeten continues to monitor the area and work with relevant agencies to complete the decontamination process and prevent future incidents. The discovery of the Caesium-137 contamination has raised concerns about the handling of radioactive materials by industrial plants in Indonesia and the need for stricter regulations and enforcement. The authorities are working to address these concerns and ensure that all companies handling radioactive materials are compliant with safety standards. The incident underscores the importance of regular monitoring and inspections to prevent radioactive contamination and protect public health.
