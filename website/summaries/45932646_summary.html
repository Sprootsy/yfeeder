<p>The article, titled "30 days, 9 cities, 1 question: where do you belong?" by Kyla, chronicles the author's month-long journey across nine different cities in search of a place where she feels a sense of belonging. The trip was spurred by a feeling of being rootless and ungrounded after a period of constant movement and change in her life. She felt disconnected from any particular place and yearned for a sense of home.</p>

<p>The author visits various locations, including Lisbon, Madrid, Barcelona, Berlin, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Helsinki, and Tallinn. She describes her experiences in each city, focusing not just on the typical tourist attractions but more on how she felt inhabiting the space, observing the culture, and interacting with the environment. She reflects on the unique characteristics of each place and whether she could envision herself living there.</p>

<p>Throughout her travels, Kyla grapples with the complex question of belonging. She realizes that belonging isn't necessarily tied to a physical location but can also be found in communities, relationships, and even within oneself. She explores the nuances of what makes a place feel like home, considering factors like the pace of life, the people, the language, and the overall atmosphere.</p>

<p>The author's journey is not presented as a simple quest for a definitive answer. Instead, it's framed as an exploration of self-discovery and a deeper understanding of what she values in a place and in her life. She acknowledges that belonging is a fluid concept that can evolve over time. She examines the differences between visiting a place as a tourist and imagining oneself as a resident, and how those perspectives shift her understanding of each city.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the author doesn't arrive at a single, conclusive answer to the question of where she belongs. However, she gains valuable insights into her own needs and desires, allowing her to make more informed decisions about her future. The journey is transformative, leading to a greater sense of self-awareness and a more nuanced understanding of what truly matters to her in creating a sense of home.</p>
