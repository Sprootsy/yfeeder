<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>
The article discusses the predicted behavior of dying stars, specifically focusing on low-mass stars like our sun. According to new theoretical models, these stars don't simply fade away after becoming white dwarfs. Instead, they are expected to linger for billions of years, emitting a faint glow as they slowly cool and their surface hydrogen burns. This process, referred to as a "hydrogen-burning white dwarf" phase, is predicted to extend the star's life significantly. The models suggest that the final stages of a sun-like star's life will involve a prolonged period of faint light emission before they eventually cool down and become black dwarfs.

<h3>Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dying low-mass stars, like our sun, will experience a "hydrogen-burning white dwarf" phase.</li>
<li>This phase involves the star continuing to burn hydrogen on its surface after becoming a white dwarf.</li>
<li>The hydrogen burning extends the star's life for billions of years.</li>
<li>During this phase, the star emits a faint glow.</li>
<li>Eventually, the star will cool and become a black dwarf.</li>
