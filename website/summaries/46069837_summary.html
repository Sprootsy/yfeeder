    <h2>Steam censors LGBTQ&#43; content on behalf of the Russian Government</h2>

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
   The article discusses how Steam's content moderation policies and practices disproportionately affect LGBTQ+ game developers and content. It argues that Steam's approach to content filtering and community standards often results in LGBTQ+ games being censored, restricted, or outright removed from the platform, while similar content from non-LGBTQ+ developers is allowed.

  <p>
   The author highlights several ways Steam censors LGBTQ+ content:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <b>Vague and Inconsistent Application of Rules:</b> Steam's rules regarding sexually explicit content, depictions of violence, and "real-world" controversies are often vaguely defined and inconsistently applied, leading to arbitrary decisions about which games are allowed or banned. This ambiguity creates uncertainty for developers and allows for subjective biases to influence moderation decisions.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>Targeted Reporting and Review Bombing:</b> LGBTQ+ games are often targeted by coordinated reporting campaigns and review bombing efforts from anti-LGBTQ+ groups. Steam's moderation system appears to be susceptible to these campaigns, leading to content being taken down or restricted based on biased reporting rather than genuine violations of platform rules.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>Content Filtering and Visibility Issues:</b> Even when LGBTQ+ games are not outright banned, they may be subject to stricter content filtering or reduced visibility in search results and recommendations. This makes it harder for players to find and purchase these games, effectively limiting their audience and sales potential.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>Lack of Transparency and Communication:</b> Steam's moderation process is often opaque, with developers receiving little or no explanation for why their games have been censored or restricted. This lack of transparency makes it difficult for developers to appeal decisions or adjust their content to comply with platform rules.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b>Double Standards:</b> The article provides examples of games with sexual content, violence, or controversial themes that are allowed on Steam, while LGBTQ+ games with similar content are banned or restricted. This suggests a double standard in how Steam applies its rules, with LGBTQ+ content being held to a higher standard than non-LGBTQ+ content.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The author also points out that Steam's censorship of LGBTQ+ content has a chilling effect on developers, discouraging them from creating games that explore LGBTQ+ themes or feature LGBTQ+ characters. This limits the diversity of games available on the platform and harms the LGBTQ+ gaming community.
