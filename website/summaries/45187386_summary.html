    <h2>Fed helpless as US economy faces structural challenges, not monetary</h2>

<p>The article "Demise of Dynamic Duo" discusses the shift in the relationship between monetary and fiscal policy, particularly in the context of the post-Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and COVID-19 pandemic eras. Traditionally, monetary policy (controlled by central banks) and fiscal policy (controlled by governments) acted somewhat independently, with monetary policy focused on maintaining price stability and managing inflation, while fiscal policy addressed broader economic goals like employment and growth. However, the author argues that this dynamic has fundamentally changed, leading to a situation where fiscal dominance has emerged.</p>

<p>Before the GFC, central banks generally maintained independence and credibility, using tools like interest rate adjustments to manage inflation expectations and economic activity. Fiscal policy was more constrained by debt levels and political considerations. However, the GFC necessitated unconventional monetary policies like quantitative easing (QE), where central banks purchased government bonds and other assets to inject liquidity into the financial system and lower borrowing costs. This blurred the lines between monetary and fiscal policy, as QE effectively financed government spending.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated this trend. Governments implemented massive fiscal stimulus packages to support households and businesses, while central banks continued or expanded QE programs. This created a situation where monetary policy was largely accommodating fiscal policy, effectively monetizing government debt. The author argues that this has undermined central bank independence and credibility, as monetary policy decisions are increasingly influenced by the need to support government spending.</p>

<p>One of the key consequences of fiscal dominance is the potential for higher inflation. When governments can rely on central banks to finance their spending, they have less incentive to control deficits. This can lead to excessive demand in the economy, pushing up prices. The author points out that the recent surge in inflation is, in part, a result of this fiscal dominance, as governments continued to spend aggressively even as economies recovered from the pandemic.</p>

<p>The article also discusses the challenges of unwinding QE and raising interest rates in a fiscally dominant environment. Higher interest rates increase the cost of government debt, potentially leading to fiscal distress. This creates a political pressure on central banks to keep interest rates low, even if it means tolerating higher inflation. The author suggests that this situation could lead to a loss of confidence in central banks and a potential crisis in monetary policy.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the author suggests that the lines between monetary and fiscal policy have become so blurred that they have, in effect, become indistinguishable from one another. As a result, governments have become addicted to running deficits and using the central bank as a way of covering their excesses. This is particularly the case in places where there is no clear separation of powers between the branches of government. The author concludes that the shift towards fiscal dominance poses significant risks to macroeconomic stability and requires a reassessment of the relationship between monetary and fiscal policy.</p>
