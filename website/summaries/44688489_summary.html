  <p>This article by Jono Alderson argues that Single Page Applications (SPAs), while once a popular approach for building modern web experiences, are becoming less necessary and even detrimental due to advancements in CSS and native browser capabilities. The author contends that modern CSS offers powerful features that can replicate many SPA functionalities, providing improved performance, accessibility, and SEO benefits. The article explores the historical context of SPAs, highlighting their rise as a solution to the limitations of older web development techniques and then discusses the drawbacks of SPAs, including increased complexity, JavaScript dependency, and challenges for search engine optimization. The author advocates for a shift towards simpler, more semantic HTML enhanced with modern CSS, reducing the need for heavy JavaScript frameworks and complex build processes. The author further presents a vision of web development where CSS handles more of the front-end logic, leading to faster loading times, better user experiences, and improved maintainability.</p>
