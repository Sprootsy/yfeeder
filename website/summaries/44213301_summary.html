    This article from El Pa√≠s discusses the increasing surveillance in the United States, driven by technological advancements and a growing partnership between the government and private companies. It argues that the US is rapidly transforming into a mass techno-surveillance state, where personal data is constantly collected, analyzed, and shared, often without the knowledge or consent of individuals. The article highlights several key aspects of this development, including the use of facial recognition technology, the collection of biometric data, the tracking of online activity, and the sharing of information between law enforcement agencies and private corporations.

    The expansion of surveillance is being fueled by several factors. The "war on terror" after 9/11 led to increased government powers and a greater emphasis on security. The proliferation of smartphones, social media, and other digital devices has created a vast amount of personal data that can be easily collected and analyzed. Private companies, driven by profit motives, are incentivized to collect and share data, creating a surveillance economy.

    The article raises concerns about the implications of this growing surveillance state for privacy, civil liberties, and democratic values. It argues that constant surveillance can chill free speech and dissent, as people may be less likely to express themselves if they know they are being watched. The collection and analysis of personal data can also lead to discrimination and bias, as algorithms may perpetuate existing inequalities. The lack of transparency and oversight in the surveillance system makes it difficult to hold those in power accountable.

    The article also notes that the US legal framework for privacy is weak and outdated, failing to keep pace with technological developments. While some states and cities have passed laws to restrict the use of facial recognition technology or protect biometric data, there is no comprehensive federal law to regulate the collection, use, and sharing of personal data. This patchwork of laws leaves many people vulnerable to surveillance and data breaches.

    The article concludes by emphasizing the need for greater awareness and action to protect privacy and civil liberties in the face of increasing surveillance. It calls for stronger legal protections, greater transparency and oversight, and a more informed public debate about the trade-offs between security and freedom. It suggests that resisting the encroaching surveillance state will require a broad coalition of activists, policymakers, and concerned citizens working together to defend democratic values.
