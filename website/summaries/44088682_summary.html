    <h2>Writing your own CUPS printer driver in 100 lines of Python (2018)</h2>

    This article discusses the author's experience in creating a CUPS driver for a custom label printer used in a conference setting. The primary goal was to enable conference attendees to print name badges at the event. The author details the challenges and technical aspects involved in writing a CUPS driver, emphasizing the complexities arising from the driver model and the need to generate PostScript output.
  </p>
  <p>
    The author explains that CUPS (Common Unix Printing System) drivers act as intermediaries between applications and printers. Applications send print jobs to CUPS, which then uses the driver to translate the job into a format understood by the specific printer. The article highlights that while modern printers often support PDF natively, CUPS drivers typically expect to produce PostScript output, a page description language.
  </p>
  <p>
    The core problem was that the label printer only understood a proprietary, undocumented, binary format. The author had to reverse-engineer this format to create a driver that could convert standard print jobs into the printer's specific language.
  </p>
  <p>
    The author outlines the architecture of a CUPS driver, which consists of a PPD (PostScript Printer Description) file and an executable filter. The PPD file describes the printer's capabilities and available options, while the filter is responsible for the actual conversion of the print job.
  </p>
  <p>
    Creating the PPD file involved specifying the printer's media sizes, margins, and other settings. The author describes the process of defining custom media sizes to match the label dimensions. The filter was written in Python and used the reportlab library to generate PostScript code. This PostScript code was then intercepted and translated into the printer's binary format.
  </p>
  <p>
    The author describes the challenges in intercepting the PostScript output. They achieved this by patching the PostScript code generated by reportlab to include special comments. The filter then searched for these comments and replaced the relevant sections with the printer's binary commands.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article also addresses the issue of rasterization. The author initially attempted to use CUPS' built-in rasterization functionality but found it unsuitable for the label printer. They opted to perform the rasterization within the filter using the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to convert images into a monochrome bitmap format required by the printer.
  </p>
  <p>
    The author concludes by reflecting on the complexities of the CUPS driver model and the difficulties in working with undocumented printer formats. They also note that the driver, while functional, was tailored to a specific use case and might not be suitable for general-purpose printing.
