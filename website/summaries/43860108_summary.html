According to a blog post on Fivetran's website, Fivetran and Census are joining forces. The partnership aims to help companies activate data in their warehouse, leveraging it for operational workflows and customer experiences.
</p>
<p>
The partnership is based on the belief that the modern data stack, centered around the data warehouse, has become the central source of truth for businesses. The combination of Fivetran's data integration capabilities and Census's data activation platform enables businesses to not only centralize their data but also to put it to work by syncing it with various operational tools and applications.
</p>
<p>
The collaboration addresses challenges that businesses face in activating data for practical use. The traditional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes often create data silos and latency issues, hindering real-time decision-making and personalized customer experiences. By integrating Fivetran and Census, data teams can easily move data into the warehouse and then activate it for use across the organization without complex custom coding or engineering efforts. This results in quicker access to insights and the ability to deliver more relevant and timely interactions with customers.
</p>
<p>
The key benefit of the partnership is simplifying the data activation process, making it accessible to more users within an organization. With Fivetran handling the data ingestion and transformation, and Census enabling data activation, businesses can unlock the full potential of their data warehouse for a wide range of use cases, including marketing automation, sales enablement, customer support, and more. This enables companies to drive revenue growth, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize business processes.
