<p>The article from The Economist discusses the debate around the safety of touchscreens in cars. Automakers have increasingly replaced traditional buttons and knobs with touchscreens to control various vehicle functions, driven by a desire to create minimalist, tech-forward interiors and reduce production costs. However, this trend has raised concerns about driver distraction and potential safety risks.</p>

<p>Several studies and safety organizations, including the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety and Euro NCAP, have investigated the impact of touchscreen interfaces on driver attention and reaction times. These studies generally indicate that using touchscreens to perform tasks like adjusting the radio or climate control can significantly increase the time a driver's eyes are off the road, compared to using physical controls. This increase in "eyes-off-road" time raises the risk of accidents.</p>

<p>The article points out that the complexity of touchscreen menus and the need to visually confirm selections contribute to the distraction. Unlike physical buttons, which can be operated by touch without looking, touchscreens often require drivers to navigate through multiple layers of menus, diverting their attention from the driving task. Some argue that this added cognitive load can impair driving performance.</p>

<p>Euro NCAP, a European car safety assessment program, has announced plans to penalize vehicles with overly complex touchscreen interfaces starting in 2026. This move reflects growing concerns among safety advocates and regulators about the potential dangers of touchscreen-heavy dashboards. Automakers are being urged to prioritize safety and consider incorporating physical controls for essential functions or developing more intuitive and less distracting touchscreen designs.</p>

<p>The article also touches on the counterarguments made by some automakers, who claim that their touchscreen systems are designed with user-friendliness in mind and that drivers adapt to using them over time. Additionally, some manufacturers are exploring alternative interface technologies, such as voice control and gesture recognition, which could potentially reduce the need for drivers to interact with touchscreens while driving. However, the effectiveness and safety of these alternative interfaces are also subject to ongoing evaluation.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the article highlights the ongoing debate about the safety of touchscreens in cars and the need for a balanced approach that considers both technological innovation and driver safety. As cars become increasingly connected and automated, the design of in-car interfaces will play a crucial role in ensuring safe and efficient driving.</p>
