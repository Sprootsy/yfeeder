  <p>According to an FTC lawsuit, Ticketmaster, owned by Live Nation, has been intentionally harming fans by employing illegal and monopolistic practices. The lawsuit claims that Ticketmaster controls about 80% of major concert venues' ticketing, which allows them to impose excessive fees, hinder competition, and stifle innovation in the ticketing industry. The FTC alleges that Live Nation uses its dominance to prevent venues from using other ticketing services by threatening to withhold Live Nation-controlled concerts. This alleged monopolistic control has led to fans paying billions of dollars in overcharges. Additionally, the lawsuit points out that Live Nation's behavior violates a 2010 consent decree established after Live Nation merged with Ticketmaster. The FTC is seeking structural remedies that may include breaking up Live Nation and Ticketmaster to restore competition.</p>
