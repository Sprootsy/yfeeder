<h3>Summary</h3>
The article "100 Years of Martin-Löf’s Constructive Type Theory" discusses the historical development and significance of Per Martin-Löf's constructive type theory. It traces the evolution of type theory from its roots in Russell's theory of types, developed to avoid paradoxes in set theory, through the contributions of logicians and mathematicians like Brouwer, Heyting, Kolmogorov, and Curry, leading up to Martin-Löf's groundbreaking work.

The article highlights how intuitionistic mathematics, particularly Brouwer's intuitionism, heavily influenced the development of constructive type theory. Intuitionism emphasizes that mathematical objects must be constructed rather than merely asserted to exist, which aligns with the constructive nature of Martin-Löf's type theory. The Heyting interpretation of intuitionistic logic, which gives constructive meaning to logical connectives, is also a crucial precursor.

The paper describes how Martin-Löf's type theory provides a foundation for both logic and mathematics, where propositions are viewed as types and proofs as objects of those types (the propositions-as-types principle, also known as the Curry-Howard correspondence). This perspective allows for a unified framework where logical reasoning and mathematical construction are intimately connected. The theory also supports dependent types, where types can depend on values, adding significant expressiveness.

The core of Martin-Löf's type theory includes type formers like Π-types (dependent function types) and Σ-types (dependent sum types), as well as identity types. These formers enable the construction of complex types that represent mathematical structures and logical propositions. The article emphasizes the importance of judgments in Martin-Löf's type theory, which include statements about types being well-formed, objects belonging to types, and the equality of types and objects.

The paper also touches upon the computational aspects of Martin-Löf's type theory. Because proofs are objects within the theory, proof checking can be reduced to type checking, which is a computational process. This feature makes the theory suitable for implementation in proof assistants and programming languages, facilitating the development of verified software and formalized mathematics.

Furthermore, the article explores the impact of Martin-Löf’s type theory on computer science, particularly in the development of functional programming languages and type systems. The theory has influenced the design of languages like Haskell and ML, and it provides a theoretical foundation for advanced type systems that support dependent types and other features for ensuring program correctness.

Finally, the article acknowledges the ongoing research and development in type theory, including extensions and variations of Martin-Löf's original system. It points out the continued relevance of constructive type theory in both theoretical and practical domains, highlighting its role in formalizing mathematics, verifying software, and advancing the foundations of computer science and logic.
