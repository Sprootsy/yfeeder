According to a Berenberg analyst, the current artificial intelligence (AI) market frenzy is significantly larger than the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. The analyst estimates the AI bubble to be 17 times the size of the dot-com bubble when measured by the relative outperformance of technology stocks compared to the broader market. While the dot-com bubble saw technology stocks outperform by approximately 150% over five years, the AI surge has witnessed an outperformance of around 2,500% over a similar timeframe.

The analyst highlights the potential dangers of this inflated valuation, drawing parallels to the dot-com era's eventual crash. During that period, many companies with unsustainable business models and over-hyped valuations collapsed, causing significant losses for investors. The analyst suggests that a similar correction could occur in the AI sector, especially for companies with weak fundamentals that are merely benefiting from the general hype surrounding AI.

The report cautions investors to be selective and focus on companies with genuine innovation, strong business models, and proven revenue generation capabilities within the AI space. Not all companies associated with AI will be successful, and many may not justify their current valuations. The analyst emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between hype and reality to avoid potential investment pitfalls.

The analyst's perspective suggests that the AI market is currently in a state of exuberance, where valuations are not necessarily tied to real-world performance or future earnings potential. This situation creates an environment ripe for a market correction, where investors become more discerning and shift their focus to companies with demonstrable value. Investors who fail to recognize the signs of a bubble and blindly invest in AI-related stocks risk incurring substantial losses when the bubble eventually bursts.
