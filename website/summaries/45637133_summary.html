<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The article on cmaiolino.wordpress.com, titled "Dosbian," delves into the author's experience and perspective on compulsory heterosexuality, particularly as it relates to her journey as a lesbian. The author introduces the concept of compulsory heterosexuality, which refers to the societal pressure and assumption that everyone is heterosexual unless proven otherwise. This assumption permeates various aspects of life, from media representation and cultural norms to personal interactions and expectations.</p>
<p>The author reflects on how compulsory heterosexuality shaped her own understanding of relationships and attractions from a young age. She discusses the subtle and overt ways in which she was conditioned to prioritize and envision relationships with men, often to the exclusion or dismissal of same-sex attraction. This conditioning manifested in internal confusion, feelings of inadequacy, and a sense of being different or abnormal.</p>
<p>The piece explores the challenges of navigating a world designed for heterosexual relationships, including the lack of visibility and representation for lesbian relationships. The author highlights the erasure of lesbian experiences in mainstream media and the pressure to conform to heterosexual norms in social settings.</p>
<p>The author reflects on the process of recognizing and accepting her lesbian identity, which involved confronting internalized homophobia and challenging the assumptions she had absorbed throughout her life. This process was marked by moments of realization, self-discovery, and a growing sense of liberation.</p>
<p>The author uses the term "Dosbian" to illustrate an experience where people assume or treat lesbians as straight until they "prove" otherwise, drawing a parallel to the concept of being "innocent until proven guilty". This sheds light on the constant pressure lesbians face to validate or justify their identity.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the article advocates for greater awareness and understanding of compulsory heterosexuality and its impact on individuals, particularly those who identify as lesbian. It calls for a more inclusive and accepting society that embraces diverse sexual orientations and challenges the heteronormative assumptions that perpetuate inequality and discrimination.</p>
