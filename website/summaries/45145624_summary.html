 <h3>Summary</h3>
 <p>
 The article discusses the increasing challenges faced by young adults in Britain today compared to previous generations, specifically focusing on the difficulties in achieving milestones such as homeownership, financial security, and starting a family. It highlights a sense of disillusionment and anxiety among young people, who feel that the traditional markers of adulthood are increasingly out of reach.

 <p>
 The piece explores various factors contributing to this situation. One significant element is the housing crisis, with soaring property prices making it exceedingly difficult for young people to get on the property ladder, particularly in desirable areas. The article points out that wages have not kept pace with the rising cost of living, leaving many young adults struggling to save for a deposit.

 Furthermore, the nature of employment has shifted, with a greater prevalence of insecure, temporary, and zero-hour contracts. This instability makes it harder for young people to plan for the future or secure loans, which further hinders their ability to buy homes or start families.

 The article also touches upon the impact of student debt, which weighs heavily on the finances of many graduates, limiting their ability to save or invest. The rising cost of childcare is another significant barrier for those who wish to start a family.

 In addition to the financial challenges, the article suggests that societal expectations and pressures also contribute to the anxiety felt by young adults. The pressure to succeed and achieve certain milestones by a certain age can be overwhelming, particularly in the age of social media, where individuals are constantly comparing themselves to others. The article highlights the psychological impact of these challenges, with many young people reporting feelings of stress, anxiety, and hopelessness.
