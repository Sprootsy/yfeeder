  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article is a blog post by Simon Willison discussing his experiences and predictions regarding Google's Gemini AI model, specifically in comparison to OpenAI's GPT models. The post is written from the perspective of November 2025, looking back on the preceding years. Willison reflects on the initial hype surrounding Gemini, particularly the claims of it surpassing GPT-4 in reasoning and planning capabilities.

    He recalls how Google initially marketed Gemini as a multimodal model capable of processing text, images, audio, and video, leading to expectations of significant advancements in areas like robotics and autonomous systems. However, the author notes that while Gemini did represent an improvement over GPT-4, it didn't quite live up to the revolutionary expectations.

    Willison points out that Gemini's strengths were most evident in tasks requiring multimodal input, such as understanding complex visual scenes or generating content based on combined audio and text prompts. He also mentions that Gemini's integration with Google's existing ecosystem, including search, maps, and cloud services, gave it a distinct advantage in certain applications.

    Despite these advantages, the author argues that Gemini didn't completely eclipse GPT models. OpenAI continued to innovate, releasing iterative improvements and specialized models that maintained a competitive edge. Willison suggests that the AI landscape has become more diverse, with different models excelling in different areas and catering to specific needs.

    The blog post also touches on the broader impact of advanced AI models like Gemini on society. Willison discusses the ethical concerns surrounding AI bias, job displacement, and the potential for misuse. He emphasizes the importance of responsible AI development and deployment, as well as the need for ongoing research and policy discussions to address these challenges.
