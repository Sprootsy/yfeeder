    With eight months left on its charter, the International Astronomical Union's Working Group on Designating and Naming of Exoplanets (IAU WG Exoplanets) has not yet named a planet "Doge." The group, responsible for officially naming exoplanets, has historically followed a rigorous process, inviting proposals from astronomy clubs and the public, and adhering to specific guidelines that emphasize names being pronounceable, non-commercial, and not offensive. The group also prioritizes names from mythology, history, or appropriate languages. The article highlights the challenges of gaining official approval for a name like "Doge," which originates from an internet meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog and is not derived from traditional naming conventions.

    The IAU's naming process seeks to maintain a sense of scientific dignity and cultural respect. The WG Exoplanets was established to bring clarity and order to the growing number of exoplanet discoveries, ensuring that names are not only unique and recognizable but also contribute to the public's understanding and appreciation of astronomy. While the public often engages with astronomy through popular culture and internet memes, the IAU's naming conventions aim to strike a balance between public interest and scientific integrity.

    The article underscores the contrast between the informal, often humorous nature of internet culture and the formal, structured approach of scientific nomenclature. While an online petition or viral campaign could generate significant support for naming a planet "Doge," the IAU's established procedures and guidelines make it unlikely that such a proposal would be successful within the remaining term of the current working group's charter. The piece also implicitly touches on the broader issue of how scientific institutions navigate the intersection of scientific rigor and public engagement in the digital age.
