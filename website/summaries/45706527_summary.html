<p>California navigated another summer without issuing a Flex Alert, a call for voluntary electricity conservation, despite facing several challenges. These challenges included extreme heat waves, wildfires that threatened transmission lines, and drought conditions impacting hydroelectric power generation. The state's ability to avoid Flex Alerts is attributed to a combination of factors, including increased renewable energy capacity, improved grid management, and the effectiveness of existing conservation programs. The article highlights the role of new solar and battery storage projects in meeting peak demand, especially during the late afternoon and evening hours when solar production declines. Furthermore, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) has implemented advanced forecasting and coordination strategies to ensure grid stability. While California has made progress in maintaining a reliable power supply, the article emphasizes the need for continued investment in clean energy infrastructure and energy efficiency measures to address the ongoing challenges posed by climate change.</p>
