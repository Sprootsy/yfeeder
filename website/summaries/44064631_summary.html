    Furthermore, the Trump administration has reportedly pressured universities to limit the number of international students they admit, arguing that these students take spots away from qualified American applicants and may pose security risks. This pressure has resulted in universities reducing the size of their international student body and increasing efforts to recruit domestic students.
