        <h1>ICE Deports 3 U.S. Citizen Children Held Incommunicado Prior to the Deportation</h1>
        <p>
<div>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued a press release on June 12, 2008, announcing the deportation of three U.S. citizen children by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). According to the ACLU, these children were held incommunicado prior to their deportation to Colombia. The ACLU stated that ICE acted without notifying the children's U.S.-based relatives or providing them with legal representation. The children, whose mother had been deported earlier, were allegedly deported without due process and in violation of their rights as U.S. citizens.</p>

<p>The ACLU condemned ICE's actions, asserting that the deportation of U.S. citizens is unconstitutional and morally reprehensible. They highlighted the potential for long-term harm to the children, who were separated from their family and community in the United States. The ACLU demanded an immediate investigation into the circumstances surrounding the deportation and called for the children's swift return to the United States.</p>

<p>The press release emphasized that the case is not an isolated incident but rather a symptom of broader issues with ICE's enforcement practices. The ACLU has raised concerns about the agency's lack of transparency and accountability, as well as its disregard for the rights of U.S. citizens and non-citizens alike. The organization vowed to continue fighting against unjust immigration policies and to protect the rights of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.</p>
