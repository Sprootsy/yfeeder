        <h1>ICE Deports 3 U.S. Citizen Children Held Incommunicado Prior to the Deportation</h1>
        <p>
<div>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued a press release on June 12, 2008, detailing the deportation of three U.S. citizen children by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). According to the ACLU, ICE deported the three children to Colombia without notifying their U.S.-based relatives, effectively holding them incommunicado prior to their removal. The ACLU contends that this action violated the children's due process rights as U.S. citizens and contravened established procedures for the care and custody of citizen children in deportation proceedings.</p>
<p>The ACLU highlights that the children were taken into custody following the arrest of their parents on immigration-related charges. Instead of placing the children with relatives in the United States, ICE reportedly chose to deport them to Colombia, their parents' country of origin. The organization criticizes ICE for failing to make reasonable efforts to locate and notify family members in the U.S. who could have provided care for the children. The ACLU's complaint centers on the alleged lack of transparency and due process afforded to the children, arguing that their rights as U.S. citizens were ignored during the deportation process.</p>
<p>The press release includes statements from ACLU attorneys who condemn ICE's actions as unlawful and morally reprehensible. They argue that ICE's behavior demonstrates a disregard for the rights and well-being of U.S. citizen children caught in immigration enforcement actions. The ACLU calls for immediate action to rectify the situation and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The organization also emphasizes the need for greater oversight and accountability within ICE to ensure that the rights of all individuals, including U.S. citizens, are protected during immigration enforcement proceedings.</p>
<p>The case underscores broader concerns about the impact of immigration enforcement policies on families and children, particularly those with mixed immigration statuses. The ACLU's involvement signals its commitment to challenging what it perceives as abuses of power by immigration authorities and advocating for the rights of vulnerable populations affected by these policies.</p>
