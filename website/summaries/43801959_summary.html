        <h1>ICE Deports 3 U.S. Citizen Children Held Incommunicado Prior to the Deportation</h1>
        <p>

<p>According to the ACLU press release, ICE deported three U.S. citizen children to El Salvador after holding them incommunicado prior to deportation. The ACLU, along with the ACLU of Texas, Texas Civil Rights Project, and Human Rights Initiative, filed a complaint with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office for Civil Rights and the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility. The complaint alleges that ICE violated the children's rights and internal policies by deporting them without allowing them to communicate with their U.S.-based father or legal counsel. The children, ranging in age from 9 to 14, were allegedly coerced into signing documents they didn't understand and were separated from their father, who had been their primary caretaker. The father, identified as J.A.C., had been attempting to gain legal custody of the children after their mother abandoned them in the U.S. The ACLU argues that ICE's actions were a violation of the children's due process rights as U.S. citizens and also goes against ICE's own policies regarding the detention and deportation of parents and guardians. The organizations filing the complaint are calling for an immediate investigation into ICE's conduct and seeking the children's return to the United States.</p>
