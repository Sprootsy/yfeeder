        <h1>ICE Deports 3 U.S. Citizen Children Held Incommunicado Prior to the Deportation</h1>
        <p>
<div>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued a press release condemning the deportation of three U.S. citizen children to El Salvador by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). According to the ACLU, ICE held the children incommunicado prior to their deportation. The ACLU alleges that the children's mother was deported in December, and despite assurances from ICE that the children would remain in the U.S. with family, they were deported without notice to their U.S.-based relatives. The ACLU characterizes the deportations as unlawful and is demanding the immediate return of the children to the United States.</p>
