        <h1>ICE Deports 3 U.S. Citizen Children Held Incommunicado Prior to the Deportation</h1>
        <p>
 <div>
  <p>This ACLU press release reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported the parents of three U.S. citizen children after holding them incommunicado, preventing them from contacting their children before deportation. The ACLU, along with the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild and the law firm of Morgan Lewis, filed a legal action seeking the return of the parents to the United States. The legal action also seeks to prevent ICE from similarly isolating parents of U.S. citizen children in the future. The ACLU argues that ICE's actions violate the Fifth Amendment rights of the children. The press release emphasizes the trauma inflicted on the children due to the sudden and secretive deportation of their parents.</p>
