<h3>Summary</h3>
The article is a detailed personal account of the author's extensive restoration and upgrading project of a Macintosh SE/30 computer, originally manufactured in 1989. The author begins by describing the initial condition of the machine, which was acquired in non-working order and exhibiting typical issues for its age, such as a dead battery, leaking capacitors, and a yellowed case.

The restoration process involved a complete disassembly of the machine. The logic board was meticulously cleaned and recapped to address the pervasive issue of capacitor leakage, a common problem in vintage electronics that can cause significant damage. The analog board was also repaired. The author used a combination of professional services and personal effort to accomplish these tasks.

The exterior of the Macintosh SE/30 also received significant attention. The yellowed plastic case was "retrobrighted" using a chemical process involving hydrogen peroxide and UV light to restore it to its original color. The internal components, including the floppy disk drive and hard drive, were cleaned, tested, and, in some cases, replaced.

Beyond restoration, the author undertook several upgrades to enhance the Macintosh SE/30's capabilities. These upgrades included increasing the RAM to its maximum capacity, installing a SCSI2SD adapter to replace the original hard drive with solid-state storage, and adding an Ethernet card for modern networking capabilities. The SCSI2SD adapter significantly improved the machine's performance and reliability, while the Ethernet card allowed the vintage Mac to connect to the internet and local networks.

The author faced various challenges throughout the project, including sourcing replacement parts, dealing with fragile vintage components, and troubleshooting technical issues. They documented their progress with photos and detailed descriptions of each step, from diagnosing problems to implementing solutions. The author also shared tips and advice for others undertaking similar restoration projects, highlighting the importance of patience, careful documentation, and a willingness to learn.

Finally, the restored and upgraded Macintosh SE/30 was put back into service. The author installed period-appropriate software and demonstrated the machine's ability to perform tasks such as word processing, graphic design, and internet browsing, showcasing the enduring appeal and functionality of this classic computer. The author emphasizes that this was not just about nostalgia. They wanted to show the machine could be a useable computer.
