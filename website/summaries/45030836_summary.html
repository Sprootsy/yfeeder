     According to a whistleblower, a live copy of the Social Security database was uploaded to a vulnerable cloud server by Doge, a federal agency. The incident, which reportedly occurred on August 22, 2025, exposed the personal information of every Social Security number holder.
   </p>
   <p>
     The whistleblower, a former Doge employee who chose to remain anonymous, claims that the database was stored on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket with publicly accessible read permissions. This misconfiguration allowed anyone with an AWS account to download the entire database, which contained full names, dates of birth, addresses, and Social Security numbers.
   </p>
   <p>
     The incident was discovered by a security researcher who was performing routine scans of publicly accessible S3 buckets. The researcher immediately notified AWS, who then alerted Doge. The database was taken offline within hours of the notification, but it is unknown how many individuals accessed the data during the time it was exposed.
   </p>
   <p>
     Doge has confirmed the incident and stated that it is conducting an internal investigation. The agency has also notified law enforcement and is working with AWS to improve its security protocols.
   </p>
   <p>
     Experts say that this incident highlights the importance of data security and the need for organizations to properly configure their cloud storage solutions. They also note that the consequences of a data breach of this magnitude could be severe, potentially leading to identity theft and financial fraud for millions of Americans.
   </p>
   <p>
     This breach raises serious questions about Doge's data security practices and the oversight of sensitive government information stored in the cloud.
