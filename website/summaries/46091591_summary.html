  <p>A recent NBC News poll reveals a significant shift in American attitudes towards four-year college degrees. For the first time, a majority of Americans (49%) believe a four-year degree is not worth the cost, considering other avenues for success exist. This marks a considerable change from 2013, when only 31% held this view. The poll highlights growing concerns about student loan debt and the accessibility of higher education. Several factors contribute to this evolving perspective. Rising tuition costs have made college increasingly unaffordable for many families, leading to substantial student loan burdens that can take years or even decades to repay. The value proposition of a college degree is also being questioned as alternative paths to well-paying jobs, such as vocational training and apprenticeships, gain recognition. Additionally, some question whether college adequately prepares graduates for the workforce. Opinions vary across demographic groups. Republicans are more likely than Democrats to question the value of a four-year degree. There are also differences based on age, income, and geographic location. The poll suggests a growing perception that a college degree is not the only path to financial security and career success, leading many Americans to explore alternative options for education and job training.</p>
