<p>Microsoft is undergoing changes within its GitHub division, marked by the resignation of GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke and a shift in strategy concerning its AI team, Core AI. Dohmke, who has led GitHub for five years, will be leaving to focus on his family. His tenure saw GitHub's acquisition by Microsoft and a period of significant growth for the platform. </p>

<p>As for the Core AI team, Microsoft is transitioning its focus from internal AI development to a model where AI features are integrated directly into GitHub's product teams.
