        <h1>First and 2nd gen Nest Thermostats will lose support in Oct 2025</h1>
        <p>
<div>
<p>Google is ending software support for older Nest thermostats, specifically those launched before 2020, in May. These older devices will no longer receive software updates and will eventually stop working altogether. Users with affected thermostats are being offered a 50% discount on a new Nest Thermostat to replace their outdated models.</p>

<p>Affected models include the 2011 1st-generation Nest Learning Thermostat and the 2015 3rd-generation Nest Learning Thermostat. Google cites technological limitations as the reason for ending support. These older thermostats run on a different software platform and lack the processing power and memory to handle modern features and security updates.</p>

<p>In addition to ending support for older thermostats, Google is also discontinuing sales of Nest products in Europe. This decision is attributed to evolving business strategies and a desire to focus on other markets. European customers will continue to receive support for existing Nest devices, but no new Nest products will be sold in the region.</p>

<p>The move has raised concerns among users who feel their devices are being prematurely rendered obsolete. Some argue that Google should provide a more substantial discount or offer alternative solutions to keep older thermostats functional. There are also questions about the environmental impact of forcing users to replace devices that are otherwise in good working order.</p>

<p>Google has stated that it is committed to providing a smooth transition for affected users and that the 50% discount is intended to help them upgrade to newer, more secure, and feature-rich thermostats. However, the decision to end support for older devices and discontinue sales in Europe highlights the challenges of maintaining long-term support for smart home products and the need for consumers to consider the longevity of their devices before investing in them.</p>
