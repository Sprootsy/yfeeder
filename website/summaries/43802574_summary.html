<p>The article reports that Google is ending support for older Nest thermostats and will stop selling Nests in Europe. More specifically, Google is ending software support for the first-generation Nest Learning Thermostat, which was originally released in 2011. Users who still have this model will no longer receive software updates, and the device will eventually lose functionality. Google is encouraging users to upgrade to newer models. In addition to ending support for older models, Google also announced that it will stop selling Nest products in Europe. The reason for this decision is not explicitly stated in the article.</p>
