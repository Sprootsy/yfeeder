        <h1>First and 2nd gen Nest Thermostats will lose support in Oct 2025</h1>
        <p>
<div>
<p>The article reports that Google is ending software support for older Nest thermostats, specifically the 2017 Nest Learning Thermostat and the Nest Thermostat E, starting May 7, 2024. These devices will no longer receive software updates, and users will eventually lose the ability to manage them through the Nest app. Instead, they will be migrated to the Google Home app, requiring a Google account if they don't already have one. After the migration, the older Nest app will no longer work with these thermostats. Google is offering affected users a 50% discount on a new Nest Thermostat (2020) to upgrade. Furthermore, Google is discontinuing the sale of Nest products in Europe, although existing devices will continue to be supported there. The reason for this discontinuation isn't explicitly stated in the article.</p>
