        <h1>First and 2nd gen Nest Thermostats will lose support in Oct 2025</h1>
        <p>
<div>
<p>Google is ending support for older Nest thermostats and discontinuing Nest product sales in Europe. The first-generation Nest Learning Thermostat and the Nest Thermostat E will no longer receive software updates starting May 2024. Users of these older devices will not be able to migrate their accounts to Google accounts and will lose access to features within the Nest app. Functionality will be limited to basic temperature control via the device itself. Google cites technological limitations as the reason for ending support, noting that these older devices lack the memory and processing power to support newer features and security updates.</p>

<p>The end of support means that integrations with other Nest products, the Google Home app, and third-party services will cease to function. Users who want to retain full functionality will need to purchase a newer Nest thermostat. Google is offering a 50% discount on new thermostats to affected users. Additionally, Google plans to stop selling Nest products in Europe, although existing users will continue to receive support for the foreseeable future. The company is shifting its smart home strategy in Europe, focusing on partnerships with other smart home providers.</p>
