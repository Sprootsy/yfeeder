        <h1>First and 2nd gen Nest Thermostats will lose support in Oct 2025</h1>
        <p>
<div>
<p>Google is ending support for older Nest thermostats and will stop selling Nest products in Europe. The first-generation Nest Learning Thermostat and the Nest Thermostat E will no longer receive software updates, security updates, or bug fixes starting May 7, 2024. Google states these older models don't have the memory or processing power to support newer software features. Users with these older devices have several options: continue using the thermostat without updates, upgrade to a newer Nest thermostat at a discount, or receive a refund. The refund amount depends on the device and purchase date, requiring users to contact Google support to determine eligibility. Google is also ceasing Nest sales in Europe, citing a focus on a unified smart home platform. The company will instead offer products from other brands, like Philips Hue and Aqara, through its Google Store.</p>
