  <p>The article discusses the author's experience rewriting Ghostty, a terminal emulator, using GTK. The original Ghostty was built using a custom immediate-mode rendering engine, which the author found increasingly difficult to maintain and extend. This led to the decision to rewrite the entire application using GTK, a mature and well-supported GUI toolkit.</p>
  <p>The author details the challenges and benefits of this transition. One of the main challenges was adapting Ghostty's existing architecture to fit within GTK's event-driven model. This required rethinking certain aspects of the application's design, particularly around input handling and rendering. The author also mentions dealing with GTK's complexity and the learning curve associated with a new framework.</p>
  <p>Despite the challenges, the author highlights several advantages of using GTK. GTK provides a wide range of pre-built widgets and functionalities, which significantly reduces the amount of code that needs to be written from scratch. This allows the author to focus on Ghostty's unique features and improve overall performance and stability. GTK also offers better accessibility support and integration with various desktop environments.</p>
  <p>The article also touches on specific technical details of the rewrite, such as the use of OpenGL for rendering and the implementation of a custom text buffer. The author explains how these components interact with GTK to create the desired terminal experience.</p>
  <p>Overall, the author expresses satisfaction with the rewrite, stating that it has resulted in a more maintainable, extensible, and feature-rich terminal emulator. The use of GTK has allowed the author to leverage existing technologies and focus on delivering a better user experience.</p>
