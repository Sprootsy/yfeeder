  <p>The MastodonMigration account on Mastodon shared information about a new feature in Mastodon version 4.3.0 related to account migration. Specifically, users can now be redirected from their old Mastodon account to their new one. This feature is intended to help followers easily find and follow the user's new account when they move to a different server. The post detailed that in the profile settings, under "Account," there is a new section called "Account migration." Users can use this to announce they have moved to a different account, and Mastodon will then display a prominent notice on their profile indicating the move, complete with a link to the new account. This redirection persists for up to three months, after which the user can choose to remove it. The announcement emphasized that this feature simplifies the process for users and their followers when migrating between Mastodon servers.</p>
