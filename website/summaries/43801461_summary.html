        <h1>Apparently Bluesky has one centralized service, the &#34;relay&#34;</h1>

<p>The original post is from the account @mastodonmigration on the mastodon.online instance. It addresses the impending shutdown of the mastodon.social instance by Eugen Rochko, the founder of Mastodon. The post conveys a sense of urgency and provides guidance for users on mastodon.social to migrate their accounts to other Mastodon instances.</p>

<p>The post begins by stating the unavoidable nature of the shutdown.  It acknowledges that many users joined mastodon.social due to its association with the founder and the belief that it was the "official" or best instance. However, it emphasizes that the Fediverse is designed to be decentralized, with no single instance being inherently superior.  The post stresses that all Mastodon instances are equally valid parts of the network.</p>

<p>The core message is a call to action for users of mastodon.social to migrate their accounts.  The post explains that migration involves moving followers and followed accounts to a new instance.  Importantly, it clarifies that posts themselves are not migrated, but implies that users can export their data for archival purposes.  The post then outlines the steps involved in migration, which involve choosing a new instance, creating an account on that instance, and initiating the migration process from the old account settings on mastodon.social. A crucial piece of guidance is to not delete the mastodon.social account until the migration is fully completed to ensure a smooth transfer of followers.</p>

<p>The post recommends using the service &quot;Instances&quot; to find a suitable alternative instance. It suggests utilizing search filters like "Open registrations" and "English language" to find instances accepting new members and aligned with the user's language preference.  The importance of reading the server rules is also highlighted to ensure the new instance aligns with the user's values and expectations.</p>

<p>The post offers practical advice on how to perform the migration within the Mastodon platform. The guide suggests navigating to "Account settings," then "Moving from a different account," and then following the prompts to initiate the move. The post reiterates that it is crucial to *not* delete the mastodon.social account until the entire follower migration is done, because deleting it will break the connection and prevent followers from being transferred.</p>

<p>The overall tone is informative, supportive, and reassuring. It acknowledges the disruption caused by the shutdown but frames it as an opportunity to engage with the decentralized nature of the Fediverse. By providing clear instructions and resources, the post aims to empower users to take control of their accounts and find new homes within the Mastodon network. The underlying message is that the Fediverse is a diverse ecosystem, and this migration is a natural part of its evolution.</p>
