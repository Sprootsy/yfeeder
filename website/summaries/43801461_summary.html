  <p>The original post is from the account @mastodonmigration on mastodon.online. It addresses concerns and misinformation regarding the migration of accounts between Mastodon servers. The post emphasizes that migrations are not forced and are entirely voluntary. Users retain full control over their accounts and data. It aims to clarify the purpose and process of migration, reassuring users about the safety and security of their data during and after the migration process.</p>

  <p>The post tackles specific false claims. It states that migrations do not automatically delete accounts on the original server. Users who migrate can continue to use their old accounts, although it is discouraged. User data, including posts and followers, is copied to the new server during migration; nothing is deleted. Furthermore, migrations do not expose any private data or grant any additional access to user information. The post also explains that server administrators sometimes recommend migrations to consolidate resources, improve performance, or align with specific community goals. However, the final decision to migrate always rests with the user.</p>

  <p>The post also encourages users to ask questions and seek clarification from server administrators or trusted sources if they have any doubts or concerns about the migration process. It reiterates that transparency and user control are paramount in migrations. The goal of the announcement is to dispel fears and provide accurate information, empowering users to make informed decisions about their Mastodon accounts.</p>
