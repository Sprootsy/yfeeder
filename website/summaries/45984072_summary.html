    <h2>Pozsar&#39;s Bretton Woods III: The Framework</h2>

<p>According to Zoltan Pozsar, Bretton Woods II, a system characterized by the US importing goods and exporting dollars while other countries accumulated dollar reserves, reached its limit with the rise of China. Bretton Woods III is emerging, defined by a competition between the West and a bloc of nations, including Russia and China, over resources, trade routes, and currency dominance. This new world order is characterized by de-dollarization.

The framework for Bretton Woods III is shaped by several key factors: the weaponization of the dollar and SWIFT, the energy crisis in Europe, and the shift in global power dynamics. Following sanctions against Russia, the West essentially weaponized the dollar, prompting countries to seek alternatives and reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar for trade and reserves. The energy crisis, particularly in Europe, highlighted the vulnerabilities of relying on Western-dominated systems for critical resources. The shift involves a move toward a multi-polar currency world where commodities, especially energy, play a central role.

Pozsar contends that Russia and China are backing their currencies with commodities, creating a new system where value is tied to real assets rather than promises or debt. This commodity-backed system contrasts with the West's reliance on fiat currencies and debt-based systems. Gold will serve as a neutral reserve asset in this new system.

Key elements include:

1.  **Weaponization of the Dollar:** Sanctions against Russia have accelerated the search for alternatives to the dollar-dominated financial system.
2.  **Energy Crisis:** Europe's energy crisis underscores the need for nations to secure reliable resource supplies outside of Western control.
3.  **Commodity-Backed Currencies:** Russia and China are building a system where their currencies are backed by commodities, providing a tangible value proposition.
4.  **De-dollarization:** Nations are actively reducing their dependence on the U.S. dollar for trade and reserves.
5.  **Multi-Polar Currency World:** A shift towards a system where multiple currencies compete for dominance, reducing the hegemony of the U.S. dollar.
6.  **Geopolitical Realignment:** The formation of a new economic bloc challenging the established Western order.

The author suggests that this shift will have profound implications for global finance, trade, and geopolitics, potentially leading to increased instability and competition between blocs. The new system favors countries with abundant natural resources and those willing to trade in non-dollar currencies.
