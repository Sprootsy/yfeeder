    <h2>Redmond, WA, turns off Flock Safety cameras after ICE arrests</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The city of Redmond, Washington has deactivated its Flock Safety automated license plate reader (ALPR) cameras following concerns raised after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) used data from these cameras to locate and arrest individuals. The city suspended the cameras on May 17th and permanently deactivated them on May 28th. While Redmond Police Chief Darrell Lowe stated that the department was unaware of ICE's use of the ALPR data, public records revealed that ICE had requested and received ALPR data from Redmond in January. The city justified sharing the data with ICE as being consistent with state law and city policy, citing that the data was accessible to any law enforcement agency. Critics, including the ACLU of Washington, argue that the use of ALPR data by ICE undermines local policies aimed at protecting immigrant communities. Concerns were voiced that sharing this data violates the spirit of Washington state's Keep Washington Working Act, which restricts local law enforcement from inquiring about immigration status or enforcing federal immigration laws. The Redmond City Council is now exploring options to update city policies regarding data sharing and privacy, with a focus on balancing law enforcement needs with community concerns about privacy and potential misuse of data. The situation has sparked a broader debate about the appropriate use of ALPR technology and the extent to which local law enforcement should cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts.</p>
