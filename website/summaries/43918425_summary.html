<p>The article, titled "Tariffs Killed Arduboy," discusses the reasons behind the discontinuation of the Arduboy, a handheld gaming console known for its educational aspects and promotion of game development. The primary reason cited for the Arduboy's demise is the imposition of tariffs on electronics imported from China to the United States. According to the author, these tariffs significantly increased the cost of manufacturing and importing the Arduboy, making it financially unsustainable to continue production.</p>

<p>The Arduboy was more than just a gaming device; it was a platform that encouraged users to learn about programming and game design. Its open-source nature allowed enthusiasts to create and share their own games, fostering a community of developers and players. The author emphasizes the unique value proposition of the Arduboy, highlighting its role in education and its contribution to the maker movement.</p>

<p>However, the increased costs due to tariffs presented a major challenge. The author explored various options to mitigate the impact, such as increasing the price of the Arduboy or moving production to a different country. However, these options were deemed either unfeasible or insufficient to offset the added expenses. Raising the price would have made the Arduboy less accessible to its target audience, particularly students and hobbyists, while relocating production would have involved significant logistical and financial hurdles.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the decision was made to discontinue the Arduboy. The author expresses disappointment and frustration over the situation, lamenting the loss of a valuable educational tool and a vibrant community. They also acknowledge the impact on customers and supporters who had invested in the Arduboy ecosystem.</p>
