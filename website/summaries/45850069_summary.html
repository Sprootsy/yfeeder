<p>James D. Watson, the Nobel Prize-winning biologist who co-discovered the structure of DNA, died at the age of 96 in Cambridge, England. His death was confirmed by his son, Rufus Watson. Watson's work, along with Francis Crick, revolutionized the field of biology and provided a foundation for modern genetics. Their discovery of the double helix structure of DNA in 1953, based on X-ray diffraction images taken by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, unlocked the secrets of heredity and paved the way for advancements in medicine, biotechnology, and our understanding of life itself.</p>

<p>Despite his monumental scientific achievements, Watson's later life was marred by controversy due to his outspoken and scientifically unfounded views on race and intelligence. These views, which he repeatedly expressed in public, led to his ostracization from the scientific community and the revocation of honorary titles. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he had served as director and president for decades, severed ties with him after he reiterated his controversial opinions in a 2019 documentary. The laboratory had previously suspended him in 2007 after similar comments.</p>

<p>Watson's early life was marked by a precocious intellect and a rapid ascent through the academic world. He earned a Ph.D. in zoology from Indiana University at the age of 22 and quickly turned his attention to the study of DNA. His collaboration with Francis Crick at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge led to their groundbreaking discovery, for which they, along with Maurice Wilkins, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962. Rosalind Franklin, whose crucial X-ray diffraction work was essential to their model, had died in 1958 and was therefore ineligible for the Nobel Prize.</p>

<p>After his work on DNA, Watson held prominent positions in the scientific world, including a professorship at Harvard University and the directorship of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He also played a key role in launching the Human Genome Project, a massive international effort to map the entire human genome. While he initially championed the project, he later expressed concerns about the ethical implications of genetic research.</p>

<p>Despite his scientific legacy, Watson's reputation was irrevocably damaged by his racist and sexist views. His comments on race, intelligence, and other sensitive topics drew widespread condemnation and overshadowed his contributions to science. While some argued that his scientific achievements should be considered separately from his personal beliefs, others maintained that his views were deeply harmful and should not be excused.</p>

<p>Watson is survived by his sons, Rufus, Walter, and Duncan. His death marks the end of an era in the history of biology, but his legacy remains complex and controversial.</p>
