  <p>Summary:</p>
  <p>The article reports that the Biden administration is considering expanding the monitoring of international students in the United States by including a review of their social media accounts as part of the visa screening process. This proposal is generating debate, with proponents arguing it could enhance national security by identifying potential threats and those who might overstay their visas. They suggest that social media provides a readily accessible source of information to vet individuals and assess their intentions. However, critics raise significant concerns about privacy, freedom of speech, and potential biases in the screening process. They argue that monitoring social media could lead to discrimination based on nationality, religion, or political views, and that it could chill academic freedom by discouraging students from expressing their opinions online. There are also questions about the accuracy and reliability of social media data, as well as the resources required to effectively monitor a large number of students' accounts. This debate highlights the tension between national security concerns and the protection of individual rights and academic freedom in the context of international education.</p>
