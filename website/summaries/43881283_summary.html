    <h2>Spain-Portugal blackouts: what happened</h2>
    <div>

  <p><b>Summary:</b></p>
  <p>
    On April 25, 2024, Spain and Portugal experienced a significant drop in electricity demand, leading to a near blackout situation. This event highlighted the vulnerabilities of electricity grids to sudden fluctuations caused by increased renewable energy sources and complex market dynamics. The incident began with a sharp decline in electricity consumption, primarily due to a public holiday in Portugal and decreased industrial activity in Spain. This sudden drop in demand, coupled with a high influx of solar energy, created a surplus of electricity in the system.
  </p>
  <p>
    To manage this surplus, grid operators in both countries took measures to reduce electricity production, particularly from renewable sources. However, the speed and scale of these adjustments proved insufficient to prevent a severe imbalance. The situation was further complicated by the Iberian electricity market (MIBEL), which operates across both countries. The market's design and operational procedures struggled to handle the rapid changes in supply and demand, leading to price distortions and operational challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
    The near blackout was averted due to emergency actions taken by grid operators, including curtailing renewable energy production and activating reserve power plants. These measures stabilized the grid and prevented a widespread power outage. The incident prompted investigations and discussions about the need for improved grid management strategies, better forecasting of electricity demand and renewable energy production, and enhanced coordination between Spain and Portugal. The event serves as a crucial learning opportunity for Iberia and the broader European energy system, emphasizing the importance of adapting infrastructure and market mechanisms to accommodate the increasing share of variable renewable energy sources.
  </p>
  <p>
    The integration of renewables requires more flexible and responsive grid operations, as well as market designs that can handle rapid changes in supply and demand. Furthermore, the incident underscores the necessity for enhanced cross-border collaboration to ensure grid stability and prevent similar events in the future. By addressing these challenges, Iberia and Europe can move towards a more resilient and sustainable energy system.
