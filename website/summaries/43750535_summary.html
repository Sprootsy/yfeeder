<h3>Summary</h3>
The article "Getting Forked by Microsoft" by Philip Laine details the author's experience with Microsoft essentially creating a competing product based on his open-source project, TextQL. TextQL is a tool that allows users to execute SQL queries against text files like CSVs. Laine recounts the history of developing TextQL, open-sourcing it, and observing its adoption over time. He highlights the project's unique value proposition and the niche it filled in data processing workflows.

The core of the article revolves around Microsoft's announcement and release of a similar tool called "Text to Data" within their Power BI suite. Laine noticed striking similarities between Text to Data and TextQL, including the core functionality of querying text files using SQL, the user interface design, and even specific design choices related to data type inference and query execution.

Laine expresses a mix of emotions, ranging from disappointment and frustration to a sense of validation. He acknowledges that Microsoft, as a large corporation, has the resources and capabilities to develop such a tool independently. However, the numerous parallels between Text to Data and TextQL lead him to believe that his open-source project served as a significant source of inspiration, if not a direct blueprint, for Microsoft's offering.

The article explores the ethical considerations surrounding the situation. Laine questions whether Microsoft should have acknowledged TextQL as an inspiration or considered contributing to the existing open-source project instead of creating a proprietary alternative. He reflects on the challenges faced by independent open-source developers when their work is potentially replicated by large companies.

Laine also discusses the potential impact on TextQL's future. He recognizes that Microsoft's entry into the market could diminish TextQL's user base and relevance. Despite this, he maintains a positive outlook, emphasizing the value of open-source software and the importance of community contributions. He suggests that TextQL can still thrive by focusing on features and use cases not addressed by Microsoft's product.

The author emphasizes the importance of open-source licensing and the freedoms it provides. While Microsoft's actions may be perceived as unfair, they are technically within the bounds of the MIT license under which TextQL was released. The article serves as a case study on the complexities of open-source development and the dynamics between independent developers and large corporations.

Ultimately, Laine uses the experience as an opportunity to reflect on the impact of his work and the broader implications for the open-source community. He encourages other developers to continue creating and sharing their projects, despite the potential for similar situations to arise. The article promotes the values of open collaboration and innovation while acknowledging the challenges of competing with powerful corporate entities.
