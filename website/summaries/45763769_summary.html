<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The article "Money Off the Table" by Zach Holman discusses the phenomenon of leaving potential revenue unrealized in business, particularly in software companies. Holman argues that many companies, driven by factors like fear of alienating users, inertia, or a focus on idealistic goals, fail to adequately explore and capture available value. He frames this as "money off the table," representing opportunities for increased revenue that are consciously or unconsciously ignored.</p>

<p>Holman emphasizes that this isn't necessarily about being greedy or exploitative. Instead, it's about strategically considering all available options to generate revenue and ensure the long-term sustainability and growth of the business. He uses several examples to illustrate this point, including charging appropriately for enterprise features, pricing plans that don't scale with value, and underutilizing existing user data for monetization.</p>

<p>The author suggests that a common culprit is an overemphasis on user experience to the detriment of revenue generation. While a positive user experience is undoubtedly important, Holman argues that it shouldn't be the sole guiding principle, especially when it leads to leaving significant revenue on the table. He calls for a more balanced approach, one that carefully considers both user satisfaction and the financial health of the company.</p>

<p>Another factor he highlights is the reluctance to revisit pricing models or introduce new features that could generate revenue. This inertia, he suggests, can stem from a fear of upsetting existing users or a belief that the current model is "good enough." However, he argues that complacency can be a significant obstacle to growth and that companies should be willing to experiment and adapt their monetization strategies.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the article touches on the importance of understanding the value your product provides to different segments of users. He points out that enterprise users, in particular, are often willing to pay significantly more for features that directly benefit their organizations. Failing to cater to these users with appropriate pricing tiers and features is a missed opportunity.</p>

<p>In essence, Holman advocates for a more pragmatic and financially aware approach to building and running software companies. He encourages businesses to identify and capture the "money off the table" by carefully evaluating their pricing strategies, feature offerings, and overall monetization models. While user experience remains important, it shouldn't be the only consideration. A healthy balance between user satisfaction and revenue generation is crucial for long-term success.</p>
