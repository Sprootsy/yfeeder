  <p>Mitchell Hashimoto's article recounts his challenging experiences with startup banking, specifically focusing on obtaining and maintaining banking services for his company, HashiCorp. He emphasizes the difficulties faced by startups, particularly those in specific industries like cryptocurrency or those dealing with international transactions. Hashimoto describes his initial struggles to find a bank willing to work with HashiCorp due to its status as a young, venture-backed company. He highlights the intensive due diligence processes, including providing detailed financial projections, customer information, and explanations of their business model.</p>

  <p>The article details the ongoing scrutiny and compliance requirements imposed by banks, such as annual audits, KYC (Know Your Customer) checks, and regular reviews of account activity. Hashimoto shares anecdotes of accounts being unexpectedly frozen or closed due to perceived risks or compliance issues, even after successfully navigating the initial approval process. He also discusses the frustration of dealing with large, bureaucratic banking institutions where communication is often slow and impersonal.</p>

  <p>Hashimoto contrasts these experiences with smaller, more specialized banks that cater to startups. While these banks often offer a more personalized service and a better understanding of the startup ecosystem, they can also present limitations in terms of available services or scalability. He also addresses the issue of banking fees, which can be substantial for startups, especially those with frequent transactions or international operations. Hashimoto notes that the relationship between startups and banks is often imbalanced, with banks holding significant power due to the essential nature of their services.</p>

  <p>The author also touches upon the specific challenges related to international banking. He describes the added complexity of managing multiple bank accounts in different countries, each with its own regulatory requirements and compliance procedures. Hashimoto expresses the need for more transparency and standardization in the banking industry, particularly for startups that operate globally. He also emphasizes the importance of building strong relationships with bankers and maintaining open communication to proactively address potential issues.</p>

  <p>Finally, Hashimoto advises startups to carefully research and select a bank that aligns with their specific needs and industry. He recommends seeking referrals from other startups, understanding the bank's risk tolerance, and being prepared for ongoing compliance requirements. He suggests that while the banking landscape for startups is improving, it still presents significant hurdles that require careful planning and execution.</p>
