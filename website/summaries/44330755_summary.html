<h3>Summary</h3>
The study "Measuring the prevalence of problematic artificial intelligence: Development and validation of the Problematic Artificial Intelligence Scale (PAIS)" introduces and validates a new psychometric scale, the Problematic Artificial Intelligence Scale (PAIS), designed to measure the prevalence and severity of problematic interactions with AI. The authors highlight the increasing integration of AI into daily life and the potential for negative consequences arising from its use, such as addiction-like behaviors, loss of control, and negative impacts on mental health and social functioning.

The paper details the development process of the PAIS, which involved several stages. Initially, a comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify relevant constructs and behaviors associated with problematic technology use and human-AI interaction. This was followed by the generation of an initial pool of items designed to capture various facets of problematic AI engagement. These items were then subjected to expert review to assess their clarity, relevance, and comprehensiveness.

The resulting items were then administered to a sample of participants through online surveys. The data collected were analyzed using statistical techniques, including exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), to identify the underlying dimensions of problematic AI use and to refine the scale's structure. The analyses revealed a robust factor structure, suggesting that problematic AI use is a multidimensional construct.

The PAIS was found to have good psychometric properties, including strong internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity. The scale demonstrated its ability to differentiate between individuals with varying levels of problematic AI engagement. Furthermore, the study explored the relationship between PAIS scores and other relevant variables, such as mental health indicators and measures of social functioning, providing evidence for the scale's concurrent and predictive validity.

The authors emphasize the potential applications of the PAIS in research and clinical settings. They suggest that the scale can be used to identify individuals at risk of developing problematic AI use patterns, to monitor the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing problematic AI engagement, and to advance our understanding of the psychological and social factors that contribute to problematic AI use. The study acknowledges the limitations such as reliance on self-report data and the cross-sectional nature of the study, highlighting the need for future research to address these limitations and to further explore the complex relationship between humans and AI.
