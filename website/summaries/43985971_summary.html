  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The article "The Server That Wasn't Meant to Exist" tells the story of a rogue server that appeared on a corporate network and the ensuing investigation to determine its purpose and origin. The author, a network administrator, discovered the server through routine network monitoring. The server, named 'BASTION', was running an outdated operating system (Windows NT 4.0) and a web server, hosting a single HTML page. This page contained only the text "Hello, world!". The author couldn't find any documentation or record of BASTION's existence. Initial scans revealed no open ports other than the web server, and attempts to trace its network connection led to dead ends. The server's hardware was equally mysterious, lacking any identifying marks or asset tags.</p>

  <p>The author then tried to find the owner of the server by identifying the owner of the IP address, however, it was a dead end. No domain name was associated with the IP address, but the author found that the IP was static, this revealed that it had not been automatically allocated by DHCP. The author started to inspect the server's log files. They were able to find out that the server had been running for over 20 years. Through meticulous analysis of the web server logs, the author was able to discover that the server was only accessed by a single IP address. After discovering the access IP address, the author decided to track the address and discovered that it was an old computer belonging to a former employee of the company, who had left 20 years ago. After further investigation, the author found the former employee and asked him about the server. The former employee confessed that he had set up the server as a personal project to learn about web servers. He had completely forgotten about it until contacted by the author.</p>

  <p>The article highlights the challenges of managing a large corporate network, the importance of network monitoring, and the potential for unexpected discoveries. It also touches on the human element of IT, showing how a forgotten personal project can persist for decades, hidden within the infrastructure of a large organization. The author concludes by emphasizing the need for proper documentation and decommissioning procedures to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future.</p>
