  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The article is a personal recommendation to delete WhatsApp and switch to Signal for messaging. The author expresses concerns about WhatsApp's privacy practices, particularly its association with Facebook (Meta) and the company's history of data collection and utilization. The author emphasizes Signal's focus on privacy and security, highlighting features like end-to-end encryption, open-source code, and its operation as a non-profit organization. The author contrasts this with WhatsApp's data collection policies and perceived privacy risks.</p>
