    <h2>Nearly 20% of cancer drugs defective in 4 African nations</h2>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has revealed that nearly 20% of cancer medicines surveyed in four African countries — Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda — are either substandard or falsified. This alarming discovery raises serious concerns about the quality and safety of cancer treatment available in these regions. The investigation, spanning from 2017 to 2021, analyzed 840 samples of cancer drugs and found that 19.1% did not meet the required standards. Substandard drugs contain incorrect amounts of active ingredients, while falsified drugs are deliberately misrepresented in terms of identity or source. The presence of these defective medications not only undermines treatment efficacy but also poses significant risks to patients, potentially leading to treatment failure, increased drug resistance, and adverse health outcomes, including death. The WHO emphasizes the urgent need for increased vigilance and robust regulatory systems to combat the circulation of substandard and falsified medicines, thereby safeguarding public health and ensuring that cancer patients receive effective and safe treatment.</p>
