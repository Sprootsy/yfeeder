    <h2>LLMs pose an interesting problem for DSL designers</h2>

  <p>The article discusses the idea of designing a programming language specifically tailored for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs). The author argues that while current programming languages can be used to work with LLMs, a dedicated language could offer significant advantages in terms of expressiveness, safety, and efficiency. The core concept is to create a language where LLM interactions are a first-class citizen, deeply integrated into the language's syntax and semantics.</p>
  <p>The author starts by highlighting the challenges of using existing languages like Python for LLM-related tasks. These challenges include the impedance mismatch between the imperative style of traditional programming and the declarative nature of LLM prompts, the lack of built-in mechanisms for handling LLM-specific errors and biases, and the complexity of managing LLM context and state. The author proposes that a new language could address these issues by providing dedicated syntax for prompt engineering, built-in data types for representing LLM responses, and mechanisms for ensuring the safety and reliability of LLM interactions.</p>
  <p>The article then explores potential features of such a language. These include:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Prompt templates as first-class citizens:</b> Allowing prompts to be defined and manipulated as easily as strings or numbers, with built-in support for variable substitution and formatting.</li>
   <li><b>Type system aware of LLM responses:</b> Providing data types that represent the structure and content of LLM outputs, enabling static checking and preventing runtime errors.</li>
   <li><b>Safety mechanisms for preventing prompt injection:</b> Incorporating features to automatically sanitize user input and prevent malicious prompts from being executed.</li>
   <li><b>Built-in support for LLM context management:</b> Providing mechanisms for maintaining and updating LLM context across multiple interactions, simplifying the development of conversational applications.</li>
   <li><b>Tools for debugging and testing LLM interactions:</b> Offering features for tracing the execution of LLM prompts, inspecting LLM responses, and identifying potential errors or biases.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The author also discusses the potential benefits of such a language, including increased developer productivity, improved code quality, and enhanced safety and reliability of LLM-powered applications. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of exploring new approaches to programming with LLMs and suggests that a dedicated language could be a valuable tool for unlocking the full potential of these powerful models.</p>
