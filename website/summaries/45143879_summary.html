<p>The article discusses Google's announcement that they will be ending support for the Nest 1st and 2nd generation thermostats on October 25, 2025. This means that after this date, these older thermostats will no longer connect to the Nest service, rendering them essentially inoperable as smart thermostats. Users will not be able to control them remotely through the Nest app, nor will they benefit from any of the smart features that rely on a cloud connection.</p>

<p>The reason for ending support is attributed to technological limitations and the inability of these older devices to support modern security and feature updates. Google is encouraging users of these older thermostats to upgrade to newer Nest thermostat models to maintain functionality and access to the latest features and security improvements.</p>

<p>The primary implication is that owners of these older Nest thermostats will need to replace them if they want to continue using a smart thermostat system. After October 25, 2025, the affected devices will essentially become standard, non-connected thermostats. This situation may also affect integrations with other smart home platforms that rely on the Nest API, including Hubitat. Hubitat users who rely on integrating these Nest thermostats with Hubitat automations will need to switch to a newer, supported thermostat to maintain those integrations.</p>

<p>For Hubitat users, this means re-evaluating their thermostat setup and potentially purchasing newer Nest thermostats or considering alternative thermostat options that are compatible with Hubitat. Users may need to explore options of replacing their existing Nest integration with a solution for the new thermostat.</p>
