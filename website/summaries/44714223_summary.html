<h3>Summary</h3>
The article is a comprehensive exploration of building a clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It guides the reader through the process of creating a functional and visually appealing clock from scratch. The article begins by setting up the basic HTML structure, including the necessary `<div>` elements for the clock face, hands (hour, minute, and second), and center point. It then delves into styling the clock with CSS, covering aspects such as positioning, sizing, colors, and transformations to achieve the desired aesthetic. The core functionality of the clock is implemented using JavaScript. The JavaScript code retrieves the current time, calculates the angles for each hand, and applies CSS transformations to rotate the hands accordingly. The article meticulously explains the mathematical calculations involved in converting time units (hours, minutes, seconds) into angles suitable for rotating the clock hands. The code also includes a `setInterval` function to update the clock every second, ensuring real-time accuracy. The article also demonstrates how to style and position the clock hands using CSS, setting their origin points correctly for accurate rotation around the clock's center. It emphasizes the importance of CSS transformations for rotating the hands smoothly. Throughout the article, code snippets are provided and explained in detail, making it easy for readers to follow along and implement the clock themselves.
