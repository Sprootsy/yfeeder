<p>The article "Stop Killing Games" on StopKillingGames.com is a passionate plea to preserve video games, particularly online games, in their playable form. It argues against the common practice of companies shutting down game servers and removing games from digital storefronts, effectively making them inaccessible and unplayable, even for those who have legally purchased them. The author emphasizes that video games, like other forms of art and media, deserve to be preserved for future generations.</p>

<p>The article highlights several reasons why this preservation is crucial. First, video games are a form of artistic expression and cultural heritage. They reflect the creativity, innovation, and social values of their time. Losing them is akin to losing books, films, or music. Second, many games offer unique experiences that cannot be replicated. The gameplay, stories, and communities formed around these games are often irreplaceable. Third, the author argues that consumers have a right to access and play the games they have purchased. Shutting down games is seen as a violation of consumer rights and a betrayal of trust.</p>

<p>The author criticizes the current state of digital distribution, where games are often treated as temporary services rather than permanent products. This model gives companies excessive control over access to games and allows them to arbitrarily remove games from sale and shut down servers. The article also points out the lack of legal frameworks and industry standards for game preservation. Copyright laws, DRM (Digital Rights Management), and the absence of clear guidelines make it difficult for archivists and enthusiasts to preserve games legally.</p>

<p>The article calls for a multi-faceted approach to game preservation. This includes advocating for legal reforms that protect the rights of consumers and archivists, promoting the development of open-source emulators and server emulators, supporting efforts to archive game code and assets, and raising awareness among the public and the gaming industry about the importance of game preservation. The author urges gamers, developers, publishers, and policymakers to work together to ensure that video games are not lost to time.</p>
