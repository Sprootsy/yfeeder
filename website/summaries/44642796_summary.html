 <h2>Summary</h2>
 <p>Cherry Tree, a company, has decided to discontinue its accreditation with the Better Business Bureau (BBB). The primary reason cited is the perceived lack of value derived from the accreditation in relation to its cost. The company believes that the BBB's influence and relevance have diminished over time, particularly with the rise of other online platforms like Google, Yelp, and Facebook, where customers increasingly leave reviews and seek information about businesses. Cherry Tree argues that these platforms offer more immediate and relevant feedback, making the BBB's role less critical for consumers.</p>
 

 <p>Furthermore, the company expresses concern about the BBB's business model, which requires businesses to pay for accreditation. Cherry Tree suggests that this model creates a potential conflict of interest, as the BBB might be incentivized to favor accredited businesses, even if unintentionally. They also question the BBB's effectiveness in resolving complaints, stating that the processes can be cumbersome and that the outcomes are not always satisfactory.</p>
 

 <p>Cherry Tree emphasizes that its decision is not a reflection of a decline in its commitment to customer service or ethical business practices. The company asserts that it remains dedicated to providing high-quality products and services and to addressing customer concerns promptly and fairly. They plan to continue engaging with customers through various channels, including their own website, social media, and direct communication, to maintain transparency and build trust.</p>
 

 <p>The company also notes that it has maintained a positive rating with the BBB throughout its accreditation period, indicating a history of good business practices. However, they believe that relying solely on the BBB rating is no longer sufficient in today's digital landscape, where customers have access to a multitude of resources for evaluating businesses. Cherry Tree intends to focus on actively managing its online reputation across multiple platforms and on fostering direct relationships with its customers to ensure continued satisfaction.</p>
