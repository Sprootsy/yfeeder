<p>This article from The Signals Network and Lighthouse Reports investigates the surveillance technology company IPS, Integrated Police Systems. IPS sells surveillance technology, including video analytics, to police forces and other government agencies. The investigation reveals that IPS technology is used in ways that raise serious human rights concerns, including tracking individuals based on ethnicity and predicting crime based on biased data. The company's systems have been deployed in several European countries and beyond.</p>

<p>The investigation uncovers several key findings. First, IPS's video analytics technology can be used to automatically identify and track individuals based on various characteristics, including ethnicity, clothing, and behavior. This raises concerns about discriminatory profiling and surveillance. Second, the company's crime prediction software relies on historical crime data, which may reflect existing biases in policing practices, perpetuating discrimination. Third, the investigation reveals that IPS has provided its technology to countries with questionable human rights records, raising concerns about potential misuse and abuse. Fourth, the company has been less than transparent about the capabilities and limitations of its technology, making it difficult for the public and policymakers to assess the risks and benefits.</p>

<p>The investigation also examines the ethical and legal implications of using AI-powered surveillance technologies. It raises questions about the balance between security and privacy, the potential for algorithmic bias, and the need for greater transparency and accountability in the development and deployment of these technologies. The report highlights the importance of independent oversight and regulation to ensure that surveillance technologies are used responsibly and ethically.</p>

<p>The report details specific examples of how IPS technology is used in different countries. For example, in one European city, the system is used to monitor public spaces and identify individuals suspected of involvement in criminal activity. The investigation raises concerns that the system is disproportionately targeting minority communities. In another country, IPS technology is used to track migrants and refugees, raising concerns about potential violations of their human rights.</p>

<p>The investigation concludes that IPS's surveillance technology poses a significant threat to privacy, civil liberties, and human rights. It calls for greater transparency, accountability, and regulation in the development and deployment of these technologies. The report also urges governments and law enforcement agencies to carefully consider the ethical and legal implications of using AI-powered surveillance systems before deploying them.</p>
