    <h2>CPUs and GPUs to Become More Expensive After TSMC Price Hike in 2026</h2>

  <p>According to the article, CPUs and GPUs are projected to become more expensive following a price increase by TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) in 2026. TSMC, a major chip manufacturer, is reportedly planning to raise its prices, which will subsequently impact the cost of processors and graphics cards from companies like AMD and NVIDIA, who rely on TSMC for their manufacturing needs.</p>

  <p>The price hike is expected to affect both advanced and mature process technologies. This means that not only will high-end, cutting-edge chips become more expensive, but also older, more established chips. Several factors are contributing to this decision by TSMC. The increasing complexity and cost of developing and manufacturing chips at smaller nodes (like 3nm and beyond) is one primary driver. These advanced processes require significant investment in research, development, and equipment. Furthermore, global inflationary pressures and rising costs of raw materials and energy are also playing a role.</p>

  <p>The anticipated price increase will likely be passed down to consumers, resulting in higher prices for CPUs, GPUs, and potentially other electronic devices that rely on TSMC-manufactured chips. This could have a ripple effect across the PC and gaming industries, making high-performance hardware less accessible to some consumers. Moreover, it could affect the competitiveness of different manufacturers, as companies that are more efficient in their chip designs and manufacturing processes may be able to absorb the price increase better than others.</p>

  <p>The long-term consequences of this price hike remain to be seen, but it is likely to accelerate the trend of manufacturers exploring alternative chip foundries or developing more integrated chip designs to reduce their reliance on TSMC. It may also lead to increased innovation in chip architectures and manufacturing techniques aimed at reducing costs and improving efficiency.</p>
