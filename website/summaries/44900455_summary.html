<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The article, written as a fictional blog post dated August 14, 2025, describes a developer named Kai's positive experience using Radicle, a decentralized code collaboration platform, for a project called Jujutsu. Kai recounts his initial skepticism about decentralized platforms but highlights how Radicle solved several pain points he faced with traditional centralized platforms like GitHub.</p>

<p>Initially, Kai was reluctant to move away from established workflows. However, the allure of censorship resistance and true ownership of his code proved persuasive. He was particularly frustrated with GitHub's arbitrary takedowns and shadow banning, which led him to explore alternatives. He chose Radicle and began working on Jujutsu, a project he describes as a passion project. </p>

<p>Kai notes that Radicle's decentralized nature addressed his concerns about platform control. He was pleased to discover that he truly owned his code and the project's history, resistant to censorship or unexpected platform changes. He contrasts this with his past experience on GitHub, where projects could be taken down or access restricted without warning. The article also emphasizes Radicle's open-source nature, which allowed Kai to contribute to the platform's development and customize it to fit his needs.</p>

<p>The fictional blog post further describes how Radicle's peer-to-peer networking and local-first approach allowed Kai to work offline and avoid reliance on centralized servers. This proved particularly useful during periods of internet instability. Kai also highlights the importance of Radicle Orgs, a feature that simplifies project management and governance within decentralized teams. He explains how Radicle Orgs enabled him to easily manage permissions, track contributions, and make collective decisions about the Jujutsu project.</p>

<p>Kai also appreciates the ability to earn income directly from his work through Radicle's integration with decentralized finance (DeFi). He implemented a system where users who benefited from his work could directly support the project, creating a sustainable funding model without relying on centralized intermediaries. This fostered a more direct and transparent relationship with his users and incentivized ongoing development.</p>

<p>The article concludes with Kai encouraging other developers to explore Radicle and embrace decentralized code collaboration. He suggests that while the transition might require some adjustment, the benefits of censorship resistance, true ownership, and community-driven development make it worthwhile.</p>
