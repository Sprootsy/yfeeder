   <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
   <p>Yusuf Aytaş's article "AI Broke Interviews" discusses how the rise of AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, has fundamentally changed the landscape of technical job interviews, especially in software engineering. The author argues that traditional interview formats, which heavily rely on testing a candidate's ability to recall and apply specific algorithms and data structures under pressure, are becoming obsolete. This is because AI tools can now readily solve coding challenges and provide detailed explanations, effectively bypassing the intended assessment of a candidate's problem-solving skills, understanding of fundamental concepts, and ability to collaborate and communicate effectively.</p>
   <p>The article begins by highlighting the original purpose of technical interviews: to evaluate a candidate's problem-solving approach, coding ability, and understanding of computer science principles. The author explains that interviewers typically assess these aspects through coding exercises, system design questions, and behavioral inquiries. However, with the advent of sophisticated AI tools, candidates can now use these tools to generate code solutions, receive real-time assistance, and even simulate interview conversations. This renders the traditional metrics used for evaluation less reliable, as they may not accurately reflect the candidate's genuine skills.</p>
   <p>Aytaş points out that simply banning AI tools during interviews isn't a sustainable solution. Instead, he proposes a shift in interview strategies to focus on evaluating skills that AI cannot easily replicate. These include critical thinking, creativity, communication, collaboration, and the ability to learn and adapt. The author suggests alternative interview formats, such as open-ended problem-solving scenarios, collaborative coding exercises, and in-depth discussions about past projects and experiences. These approaches aim to assess a candidate's ability to think critically, handle ambiguity, and work effectively in a team.</p>
   <p>The article also emphasizes the importance of evaluating a candidate's understanding of the "why" behind the code, rather than just the "how." Interviewers should probe the candidate's reasoning for choosing specific solutions, their awareness of trade-offs, and their ability to explain complex concepts clearly. This helps to determine whether the candidate truly understands the underlying principles or is simply regurgitating information from AI tools.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, the author suggests that companies should focus on assessing a candidate's ability to learn and adapt to new technologies. Given the rapid pace of innovation in the tech industry, the ability to quickly acquire new skills and apply them to solve real-world problems is becoming increasingly valuable. Interviewers can evaluate this by asking candidates about their past learning experiences, their approach to tackling unfamiliar challenges, and their willingness to embrace new tools and techniques.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, Aytaş argues that the rise of AI necessitates a fundamental rethinking of technical job interviews. Companies need to move away from traditional assessment methods that can be easily circumvented by AI tools and instead focus on evaluating skills that are uniquely human, such as critical thinking, creativity, communication, and adaptability. By adopting new interview strategies that prioritize these skills, companies can ensure that they are hiring candidates who are not only technically proficient but also capable of thriving in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.</p>
