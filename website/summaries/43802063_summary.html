        <h1>Mike Lindell&#39;s lawyers used AI to write briefâ€“judge finds nearly 30 mistakes</h1>
        <p>

  <p>According to an order by Chief US District Judge Patrick J. Schiltz, lawyers representing MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell in a case against Smartmatic appear to have used AI to research and draft a legal brief that included citations to fictional court cases. Judge Schiltz noticed inconsistencies in the brief and specifically questioned the lawyers about several cases that could not be found in legal databases like Westlaw or LexisNexis. After being pressed, Lindell's legal team admitted that they had used an AI program, specifically ChatGPT, for legal research. They stated that they had asked the AI to find cases supporting their arguments about the legal concept of "reliance" and that the AI provided them with several case citations. The lawyers said they had believed the AI was a reliable tool and had not realized it could generate fictitious case law. The judge has now demanded that the lawyers explain why they should not be sanctioned under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which allows courts to penalize attorneys for submitting frivolous or unfounded court filings. The situation raises concerns about the growing use of AI in legal practice and the potential for inaccuracies or fabrications to be introduced into legal proceedings. This incident is not unique, as similar instances of lawyers citing fake AI-generated cases have occurred in other courts, highlighting the need for lawyers to verify the accuracy of AI-generated legal research.</p>
