        <h1>Mike Lindell&#39;s lawyers used AI to write brief–judge finds nearly 30 mistakes</h1>
        <p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
According to an order issued by Chief US District Judge Patrick Schiltz, lawyers representing MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell in a case involving his efforts to overturn the 2020 election included citations to nonexistent cases generated by artificial intelligence in a legal brief. The judge's order requires Lindell's legal team, led by attorney Kurt Olsen, to explain why they should not be sanctioned for including these fabricated case citations.
</p>
<p>
The order notes that the court discovered at least four nonexistent cases cited within the brief. Further investigation revealed that the citations appeared to be generated by an AI tool like ChatGPT, which is known to sometimes invent case names and legal reasoning. Judge Schiltz emphasized that lawyers have a responsibility to ensure the accuracy of their filings, and the inclusion of fake cases undermines the integrity of the legal process.

<p>
The judge’s order details the specific fabricated cases, highlighting discrepancies in their citations and subsequent verification efforts. The court clerk was unable to find any record of these cases in legal databases such as Westlaw or LexisNexis. Moreover, the format of the nonexistent citations resembled those produced by AI-powered legal research tools.
</p>
<p>
This incident raises serious concerns about the appropriate use of AI in legal research and the ethical obligations of lawyers to verify the accuracy of their sources. The judge is considering sanctions to deter similar behavior in the future. The legal team has been given a specified period to respond to the order and demonstrate why they should not be penalized for the inclusion of these AI-generated fabrications.
</p>
<p>
The case underscores the potential pitfalls of relying on AI for legal research without thorough human oversight and fact-checking. It also serves as a cautionary tale for legal professionals about the importance of maintaining professional standards and ethical responsibilities when integrating new technologies into their practice.
