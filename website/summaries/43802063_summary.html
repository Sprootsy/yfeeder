  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    According to Ars Technica, lawyers representing MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell in his defamation case have admitted to using AI in drafting a legal brief that cited nonexistent court cases. Judge Eric Tostrud, presiding over the case, highlighted these fictional citations during a hearing, questioning the accuracy and reliability of AI in legal research. The lawyers acknowledged using an AI tool, specifically ChatGPT, for legal research. They stated that they prompted the AI to find cases supporting their argument that Lindell's statements about the 2020 election being stolen were not made with actual malice, a key element in defamation cases involving public figures. The AI tool, however, generated citations to cases that do not exist, leading to embarrassment for the legal team and raising serious concerns about the use of AI in legal practice. The attorneys have since retracted the brief and filed a corrected version without the fabricated citations. The judge has not yet ruled on potential sanctions or further actions related to the incident. This incident serves as a cautionary tale about the need for careful oversight and verification when using AI tools in professional fields like law, where accuracy and reliability are paramount. It also underscores the potential risks of relying solely on AI-generated content without human review.
