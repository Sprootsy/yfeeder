        <h1>Mike Lindell&#39;s lawyers used AI to write briefâ€“judge finds nearly 30 mistakes</h1>
        <p>
<div>
<p>According to an Ars Technica article published on April 10, 2025, lawyers representing MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell in a case used AI in their legal brief and cited fictional cases. The judge overseeing the case has pointed out that the brief contained references to legal precedents that do not exist, suggesting the AI tool fabricated these case citations. The article implies that the use of AI in legal research, while potentially helpful, carries the risk of generating false information if not carefully vetted by human lawyers. The judge has not yet ruled on potential sanctions or consequences for the legal team involved, but the incident has raised concerns about the reliability of AI in legal contexts and the ethical obligations of lawyers to ensure the accuracy of their filings.</p>
