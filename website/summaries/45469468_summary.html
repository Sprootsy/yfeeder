<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The article is a critique of Electron, a framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The author expresses strong dissatisfaction with Electron, labeling it "Shamelectron" and arguing that its benefits do not outweigh its drawbacks.
</p>
<p>
The author's primary argument centers around Electron's resource intensiveness. They claim that Electron applications are significantly larger in size and consume more memory and CPU resources compared to native applications that are developed specifically for each operating system. This overhead is attributed to the fact that each Electron app essentially bundles its own copy of Chromium (the open-source browser engine behind Google Chrome) and Node.js (a JavaScript runtime environment). This leads to duplicated code and unnecessary resource consumption, especially when multiple Electron applications are running simultaneously on a system. The article criticizes the "one-size-fits-all" approach of Electron, where every application, regardless of its complexity, carries the weight of a full browser engine.
</p>
<p>
The author also points out the security concerns associated with Electron. Because Electron applications run within a web-based environment, they are susceptible to web-based vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, if not properly secured. The large codebase of Chromium also means a larger attack surface, increasing the potential for security flaws.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the author criticizes the user experience of Electron applications. They argue that Electron apps often lack the native look and feel of applications built with platform-specific toolkits. This can result in inconsistencies in appearance, behavior, and accessibility, leading to a less polished and less integrated user experience. The author also notes the performance issues that can arise from using web technologies for tasks that are better suited for native code.
</p>
<p>
The author questions the motivations behind using Electron, suggesting that it is often chosen for convenience and speed of development rather than for technical merit. They argue that while Electron may allow developers to quickly create cross-platform applications with a single codebase, it comes at the expense of performance, resource efficiency, security, and user experience. The author implies that developers should carefully consider the trade-offs before choosing Electron and explore alternative technologies that may be better suited for their specific needs.
</p>
<p>
The article concludes by advocating for a more mindful approach to software development, where performance, resource efficiency, and user experience are prioritized over convenience and rapid development. The author urges developers to consider the long-term consequences of their technology choices and to strive for solutions that are both effective and responsible.
