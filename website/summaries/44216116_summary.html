<p>A European company, TestGorilla, decided to close its US office due to concerns about American work culture conflicting with the company's values, which prioritize work-life balance. The CEO, Wouter Durville, cited the always-on mentality and the tendency to overwork among US employees as reasons for the decision. He observed that US employees were working longer hours and during vacation time compared to their European counterparts, which contradicted the company's emphasis on employee well-being and sustainable work habits. TestGorilla aims to foster a culture where employees can disconnect and recharge, believing it leads to increased productivity and creativity in the long run. The company's core values revolve around autonomy, flexibility, and trust, which they felt were being undermined by the ingrained workaholic tendencies prevalent in the US. Durville highlighted the importance of employees taking time off without feeling pressured to constantly check emails or remain available. He emphasized that TestGorilla wants its employees to enjoy their lives outside of work, and the US work culture appeared to be a hindrance to achieving that goal. Despite offering unlimited vacation time, the US employees struggled to fully utilize it, demonstrating a cultural difference in how vacation is perceived and utilized. Ultimately, TestGorilla leadership determined that maintaining a presence in the US market was incompatible with their commitment to promoting a healthy work-life balance for their entire workforce.</p>
