    <h2>Backlog.md – Markdown‑native Task Manager and Kanban visualizer for any Git repo</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p>The provided document outlines a sample product backlog for a hypothetical "Backlog" application, aiming to illustrate best practices in agile project management, particularly concerning backlog structure and user story creation. The application itself is designed to help users manage their projects, tasks, and priorities effectively. The backlog is organized into epics, which are large, overarching themes or goals, and each epic is further broken down into user stories, which represent specific features or functionalities from the user's perspective. The document emphasizes writing user stories that are independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable (INVEST). It also includes acceptance criteria for each user story, clarifying the conditions that must be met for the story to be considered complete. The backlog covers various aspects of the application, including user authentication and authorization, project and task management, collaboration, reporting, and settings. Each user story is assigned a priority (High, Medium, Low) and an estimate (in story points), reflecting its importance and complexity, respectively. The document highlights the iterative and incremental nature of agile development, where the backlog is continuously refined and prioritized based on user feedback and changing requirements. Furthermore, the sample backlog includes non-functional requirements such as performance, security, and scalability, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to product development. The structure and content of this sample backlog serve as a guide for creating and managing product backlogs effectively in agile software development environments, promoting transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement.</p>
