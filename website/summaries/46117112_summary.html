<p>The article discusses works entering the public domain in the United States in 2026. Copyrighted works from 1930 will be freely available for use, adaptation, and distribution without permission or payment. This includes books, movies, music, and other creations initially protected by copyright. The author uses the examples of notable works from 1930 like Dashiell Hammett’s "The Maltese Falcon", Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht’s "Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny", and the films "All Quiet on the Western Front" and "Morocco" to highlight the cultural impact of what will soon be available. They also mention less famous works that will become freely available, potentially offering opportunities for rediscovery and new interpretations.</p>

<p>The annual passage of works into the public domain is framed as a cultural celebration. It enriches creative opportunities as artists, educators, and researchers can build upon these works without legal constraints. The author notes the long copyright term in the U.S., which kept works from 1929 under copyright for 96 years. The Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 significantly extended copyright terms, delaying the entry of many works into the public domain. The piece also acknowledges the complex history of copyright law in the United States.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the article highlights the potential for these newly public domain works to inspire new artistic creations, research, and educational resources. It points out that making these works available promotes access to cultural heritage. The piece touches upon the balancing act inherent in copyright law: protecting creators' rights while also ensuring that creative works eventually become part of the public sphere to foster further innovation and cultural enrichment.</p>

<p>The author recognizes the role of copyright in providing incentives for creation, but emphasizes the public benefit gained when works eventually enter the public domain. The expiration of copyright is portrayed as a return of cultural property to the public, encouraging creativity and access.
