<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>The Google Security Blog post from October 2025 announces a significant milestone: the internet is now HTTPS by default. This means that all web traffic is now encrypted, protecting users from eavesdropping and manipulation. The transition to HTTPS by default was a long journey, requiring collaborative effort across the industry.</p>

<p>The blog post highlights key factors that contributed to this achievement. Firstly, the widespread adoption of HTTPS was made possible by the availability of free and easy-to-use Certificate Authorities (CAs) like Let's Encrypt, which significantly lowered the barrier to entry for website owners. Secondly, browser vendors played a crucial role by gradually marking HTTP sites as "Not Secure," incentivizing website owners to migrate to HTTPS. Thirdly, advancements in web server technology and content delivery networks (CDNs) made HTTPS deployment more efficient and less resource-intensive.</p>

<p>The article emphasizes the substantial security benefits of HTTPS by default. Encryption protects sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, and personal data from being intercepted by malicious actors. It also prevents attackers from tampering with website content, ensuring that users see the intended information. Moreover, HTTPS helps to build trust, as users can be confident that they are connecting to the legitimate website and not a phishing site.</p>

<p>The blog post acknowledges that the transition to HTTPS by default was not without its challenges. Some older websites and devices required updates or modifications to support HTTPS. However, the industry collaborated to provide resources and support to help website owners and users overcome these challenges.</p>

<p>The article concludes by expressing gratitude to the entire internet community for their contributions to this achievement. It also emphasizes that the journey towards a more secure web is ongoing. Google remains committed to advancing security technologies and working with the industry to address emerging threats. The post also subtly suggests that while HTTPS is now the norm, continued vigilance and innovation are necessary to stay ahead of evolving security challenges. The authors highlight the need for continued efforts in areas such as post-quantum cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies to ensure the long-term security and privacy of the internet.</p>
