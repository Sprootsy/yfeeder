    <h2>America Is Sliding Toward Illiteracy</h2>

<p>The article in <i>The Atlantic</i>, titled "Our Education Crisis Is a Crisis of Expectations", argues that a significant driver of the perceived decline in American education is not necessarily a lack of resources or effective teaching methods, but rather a lowering of academic expectations for students. The author contends that a combination of factors, including grade inflation, a focus on self-esteem over achievement, and a reluctance to challenge students rigorously, has led to a situation where students are not being pushed to reach their full potential. This, in turn, results in a workforce that is underprepared for the demands of a rapidly changing global economy and a citizenry that lacks the critical thinking skills necessary for informed participation in civic life.</p>

<p>The piece suggests that well-intentioned efforts to make education more accessible and equitable have inadvertently contributed to the problem. For instance, the desire to avoid labeling students as failures or to prevent them from feeling discouraged has led to a softening of grading standards and a reduction in the amount of challenging material presented. Additionally, the article points out that the emphasis on standardized testing, while intended to hold schools accountable, has sometimes resulted in a narrowing of the curriculum and a focus on rote memorization rather than deeper understanding. The author provides anecdotal evidence and references research to support the claim that students are capable of achieving more than they are currently being asked to achieve.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the article explores the role of parental involvement in the lowering of expectations. The author posits that some parents, driven by a desire to protect their children from stress or disappointment, may pressure schools to lower standards or to provide accommodations that are not truly necessary. This can create a culture in which academic rigor is seen as a negative thing, rather than as an opportunity for growth and development.</p>

<p>The author does not offer a simple solution to the problem, but suggests that a fundamental shift in mindset is needed. This shift would involve raising expectations for all students, providing them with the support and resources they need to meet those expectations, and fostering a culture that values hard work, intellectual curiosity, and a commitment to excellence. The article implies that such a shift would require a concerted effort from educators, parents, policymakers, and the students themselves.</p>
