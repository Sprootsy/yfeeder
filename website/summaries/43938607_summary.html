<p>This article is an announcement regarding changes to Google's storage policies for Google Accounts. Specifically, it focuses on how storage is used across Google Drive (including Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings, Forms, and Jamboard files), Gmail, and Google Photos, and outlines changes effective June 1, 2021. It details how these changes will impact users and provides tools and resources to manage their storage.</p>

<p>Before June 1, 2021, photos and videos uploaded to Google Photos in "High quality" were not counted towards the Google Account storage limit of 15 GB that is shared across Google Drive, Gmail, and Google Photos. However, beginning June 1, 2021, all new photos and videos uploaded in either "High quality" or "Original quality" will count towards that 15 GB storage limit. Any photos or videos uploaded before that date in "High quality" will not count towards the storage limit; they are grandfathered in.</p>

<p>The new policy also clarifies that if a user remains inactive in one or more of these services (Gmail, Drive, Photos) for two years (24 months), Google may delete the content in those services. This inactivity policy is also slated to take effect on June 1, 2021, meaning the earliest that content might be deleted under this policy would be June 1, 2023. Google will send multiple notifications before deleting any content.</p>

<p>To help users understand their storage usage and prepare for these changes, Google is providing new tools. These include a personalized estimate of how long a user's storage will last based on their upload frequency. This estimate considers the amount of content currently stored and the rate at which new content is being added. Google is also providing a storage management tool to identify and delete large or unnecessary files in Google Drive, Gmail, and Google Photos.</p>

<p>The article emphasizes that the changes are intended to allow Google to keep pace with growing storage demands and to continue to provide a reliable experience. It encourages users to review their storage usage, manage their content, and familiarize themselves with the new policies.</p>

<p>For Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) and Google One members, the policy changes are slightly different. Google Workspace storage is determined by the specific edition and the number of users. Administrators have access to tools to manage storage across their organization. Google One members will not be affected by the inactivity policy as long as they are in good standing with their payment plan.</p>

<p>Finally, Google encourages users to consider upgrading to Google One if they need more storage. Google One offers increased storage capacity, as well as additional benefits like Google Store discounts and access to Google experts.</p>
