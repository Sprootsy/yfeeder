  <p>The article is a blog post on the GRiSP website summarizing the GRiSP Nano presentation at Code BEAM STO 2025. The presentation covered the GRiSP Nano, a small form-factor industrial controller powered by Nerves and Elixir. It highlights the board's features, including its robust design, connectivity options (Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth), and expandability through Click boards. The post emphasizes the benefits of using Elixir and Nerves for building reliable and maintainable embedded systems, particularly in industrial applications. It discusses the real-time capabilities provided by Nerves and the productivity gains achieved through Elixir's concurrency model and fault tolerance. Furthermore, the presentation showcased practical examples of using the GRiSP Nano in various industrial scenarios, such as sensor data collection, motor control, and automation. The blog post also touched upon the GRiSP ecosystem, including libraries and tools that simplify development for the GRiSP Nano. It mentions the ease of deploying updates to the device over-the-air (OTA) using Nerves. The presentation aimed to demonstrate how the combination of the GRiSP Nano hardware and the Elixir/Nerves software stack can accelerate the development and deployment of industrial IoT solutions.</p>
