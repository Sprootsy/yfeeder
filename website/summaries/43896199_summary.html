<p><b>Summary:</b></p>

<p>The article discusses a recent breakthrough in the field of high-dimensional geometry, specifically concerning the possible shapes that can be formed by slicing high-dimensional cubes. Mathematicians have proven that an object with 126 dimensions contains a shape so complex and twisted that it defies previous understanding. This shape, called a "universal polytope," possesses the remarkable property that almost any other shape can be found within it as a two-dimensional slice. The discovery addresses a long-standing question in mathematics: how complex can the shapes derived from slicing higher-dimensional objects become?</p>

<p>The problem originates from the observation that simple shapes like squares and triangles can be created by slicing a cube. As the dimensions increase, the complexity of the possible cross-sectional shapes also increases dramatically. For decades, mathematicians sought to determine if there was a limit to this complexity. The work described in the article provides an answer, demonstrating that in a sufficiently high dimension (specifically 126 dimensions), a single object exists that contains an astonishing variety of shapes as slices. This shape is the universal polytope.</p>

<p>The concept of a "universal polytope" is central to the finding. This is a polytope (a geometric object with flat sides) in a certain dimension that can contain a copy of almost any other shape when sliced in two dimensions. The authors have proven that dimension 126 is sufficient to construct such a universal polytope. This is a major step forward. It doesn't mean that dimensions below 126 cannot contain complex slices; rather, it establishes a concrete upper bound.</p>

<p>The proof is based on a series of mathematical arguments and constructions. The argument involves using a specific set of rules to relate different two-dimensional shapes. These rules can be satisfied if a high-dimensional polytope exists containing all those shapes as slices. This approach allows them to determine the necessary dimensionality for such a polytope to exist.</p>

<p>The discovery has implications for understanding the nature of high-dimensional spaces and their relationship to lower-dimensional geometries. It provides insights into the limits of geometric complexity and suggests new avenues for exploring the properties of high-dimensional objects. It also highlights the power of mathematical abstraction in uncovering surprising and counterintuitive results about the nature of space and shape.</p>
