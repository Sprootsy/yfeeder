  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
   The article discusses Jane Street's unusual approach to retaining its employees, particularly junior traders, amid intense competition from other firms. Instead of simply increasing salaries or offering traditional bonuses, Jane Street has implemented a system of providing "phantom equity" and complex compensation structures tied to long-term performance. This strategy aims to incentivize employees to remain with the company for extended periods, aligning their financial interests more closely with the firm's overall success. The article suggests that Jane Street's tactics are designed to make it difficult for employees to leave, due to the potential loss of deferred compensation and the complicated nature of their pay packages. The company has also reportedly increased non-compete agreements and enhanced its legal efforts to prevent employees from joining rival firms, thus creating a more captive workforce.
