    <h2>Mail Carriers Pause US Deliveries as Tariff Shift Sows Confusion</h2>

  <p>
    Several global mail services, including Royal Mail, Deutsche Post, and
    Canada Post, have announced they will halt deliveries to the United States
    in anticipation of the end of the de minimis exception. This exception
    allowed goods valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free and with
    minimal inspection. The decision to suspend services stems from concerns
    regarding increased costs and potential delays associated with stricter
    import regulations once the de minimis threshold is eliminated.
  </p>
  <p>
    The de minimis rule has facilitated the rapid growth of e-commerce by
    reducing the burden of customs duties and taxes on low-value shipments.
    However, it has also faced criticism for allegedly enabling the entry of
    counterfeit goods, products that violate intellectual property rights, and
    items that pose security risks. Lawmakers and domestic industries have
    argued for its repeal or modification to level the playing field and protect
    American businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
    The suspension of services by these major postal operators is expected to
    significantly impact cross-border e-commerce, particularly for small
    businesses and consumers who rely on affordable international shipping
    options. The changes could lead to higher prices for imported goods, longer
    delivery times, and more complex customs procedures. Alternative shipping
    methods, such as using private courier services, may be more expensive.

  <p>
    The U.S. government has not yet officially announced the end of the de
    minimis exception, but the mail services are preparing for what they
    believe is an inevitable change in policy. The exact date for the
    elimination of the de minimis rule is not specified in the article.
