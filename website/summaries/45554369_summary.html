    This article from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) discusses China's new export controls on rare earth elements (REEs) and magnets, and their potential impact on U.S. defense supply chains. In December 2023, China implemented these restrictions, citing national security concerns. The controls cover technology related to the production of REEs and permanent magnets, requiring exporters to obtain licenses. While the specific implications remain unclear, the article suggests that these measures could significantly disrupt the global supply of these critical materials, of which China is a dominant producer.

    The article emphasizes the importance of REEs and permanent magnets for various U.S. defense applications, including missile guidance systems, radar, electronic warfare, and jet engines. It highlights the U.S. reliance on China for these materials, which poses a significant vulnerability. The authors argue that these export controls are not an isolated incident, but rather part of a broader trend of China using its economic leverage to achieve strategic objectives. They point to China's previous use of REE export restrictions against Japan in 2010 as a precedent.

    The analysis explores potential consequences for the U.S. defense industrial base, suggesting that the new restrictions could lead to price increases, supply shortages, and delays in production. Furthermore, the authors anticipate that China could use these controls to favor its domestic industries and gain a competitive advantage in emerging technologies. The article examines various policy options for the U.S. to mitigate these risks. These include diversifying supply chains by developing domestic REE mining and processing capabilities, working with allies to establish alternative sources, and investing in research and development to reduce reliance on REEs. Stockpiling critical materials is also mentioned as a potential short-term solution.

    The authors also stress the need for greater transparency and information sharing regarding the Chinese export controls. They argue that a lack of clarity about the specific items covered and the licensing process makes it difficult for companies to assess their exposure and plan accordingly. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of proactive measures to strengthen U.S. supply chain resilience and reduce dependence on China for critical materials, particularly in the defense sector. It warns that failure to address this vulnerability could have serious consequences for U.S. national security. The paper advocates for a comprehensive strategy that combines domestic production, international cooperation, and technological innovation to ensure a secure and reliable supply of REEs and permanent magnets.
