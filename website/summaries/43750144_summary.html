        <h1>Official abuse of state security has always been bad, now it&#39;s horrifying</h1>
        <p>
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
The article is an opinion piece reflecting on the state of security and government transparency in 2025. It discusses a fictional scenario where a journalist, known for investigating government overreach, is found dead in suspicious circumstances. This event triggers a reflection on the increasing power of the &#34;secret state&#34; and the erosion of public trust. The author argues that governments, particularly in the realm of security and intelligence, have become overly secretive, using national security as a blanket justification for actions that lack transparency and accountability. The piece criticizes the expansion of surveillance powers, the use of algorithms in policing and security operations, and the lack of oversight on these technologies. It also laments the chilling effect this secrecy has on investigative journalism and whistleblowing, suggesting that those who attempt to hold power accountable are increasingly at risk. The author contends that the public&#39;s right to know is being sacrificed in the name of security, leading to a dangerous imbalance of power and a decline in democratic values.
