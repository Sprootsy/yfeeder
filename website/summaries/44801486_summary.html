 <h2>Summary</h2>
 <p>According to a recent report, the U.S. government is considering pressuring Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) into acquiring a 49% stake in Intel to alleviate potential tariff burdens on Taiwan. The report suggests that the U.S. is worried about Intel's struggles in the semiconductor market and sees this move as a way to bolster Intel's position against competitors like Samsung and TSMC itself. The proposed deal aims to provide Intel with much-needed capital and potentially access to TSMC's advanced manufacturing technologies, while simultaneously securing tariff relief for Taiwan by aligning TSMC's interests more closely with the U.S. semiconductor industry. This strategic maneuver is reportedly driven by concerns over national security and the desire to maintain a competitive edge in the global semiconductor race.</p>
