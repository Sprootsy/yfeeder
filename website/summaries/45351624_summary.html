<h2>Summary</h2>
The article is a comparison between Fortran and Python, focusing on their performance in numerical computations. It highlights that while Python is often favored for its ease of use and extensive libraries, Fortran remains a strong contender, especially when performance is critical.

The author starts by acknowledging Python's popularity due to its simple syntax and the rich ecosystem of libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, which are widely used in scientific computing. However, the author notes that these libraries are often wrappers around code written in lower-level languages like C or Fortran.

The article emphasizes that Fortran, specifically designed for numerical computation, can achieve significantly faster execution speeds compared to Python, particularly when dealing with array operations and computationally intensive tasks. This performance advantage stems from Fortran's efficient memory management, compiler optimizations, and direct support for array operations.

The author presents a simple benchmark case: a program that computes a sum of exponentials. The same calculation is performed in both Python (using NumPy) and Fortran. The results demonstrate that the Fortran version can be substantially faster than the Python version.

The reasons for Fortran's superior performance are explored. Fortran compilers are designed to optimize numerical code aggressively, taking advantage of vectorization and other techniques to improve execution speed. Additionally, Fortran's column-major memory layout can be more efficient than Python's row-major layout for certain types of numerical computations.

The author then discusses the trade-offs between the two languages. Python offers greater flexibility, a larger community, and a broader range of libraries for various tasks beyond numerical computation. Fortran, while highly performant for numerical tasks, may have a steeper learning curve for some and a less extensive ecosystem for general-purpose programming.

The article also addresses the perception that Fortran is an outdated language. The author points out that modern Fortran standards (e.g., Fortran 2003, 2008, 2018) have introduced features like object-oriented programming, improved memory management, and enhanced support for parallel computing, making it a relevant and powerful language for scientific and engineering applications. The author uses a module with public and private methods to show how fortran can be object oriented.

The author concludes that the choice between Fortran and Python depends on the specific requirements of the project. If performance is paramount and the task is primarily numerical computation, Fortran may be the better choice. If ease of use, rapid prototyping, and access to a wide range of libraries are more important, Python may be preferred. The article suggests that a hybrid approach, where performance-critical sections of code are written in Fortran and integrated with Python, can be an effective strategy.
