   <p>This article discusses U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) planned acquisition of a new data analytics tool called "Hunchly," which raises significant privacy concerns. Hunchly is a tool designed to collect and archive online information, primarily used in criminal investigations. Its capabilities include automatically scraping and archiving data from websites, social media platforms, and the dark web. The tool is capable of monitoring hundreds of thousands of online sources, and archiving the information for extended periods. This raises the possibility of mass surveillance and tracking of individuals' online activities, even if they are not suspected of any crime. The tool also has features that include real-time alerts and the ability to generate reports based on collected data.</p>
