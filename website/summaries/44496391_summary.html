    More than 400 media figures have signed a letter urging the BBC board to remove Robbie Gibb from his position on the board due to concerns over his impartiality regarding the Gaza conflict. The signatories, who include journalists, producers, and filmmakers, argue that Gibb's past affiliations and perceived biases undermine the BBC's commitment to unbiased reporting. They specifically cite his previous role as a communications director for the Conservative Party and his alleged connections to individuals with strong pro-Israel views as reasons for their concern. The letter emphasizes the importance of the BBC maintaining public trust through impartial governance, particularly on sensitive and highly contested issues such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The media figures believe Gibb's continued presence on the board compromises the BBC's ability to provide fair and balanced coverage of the region.
