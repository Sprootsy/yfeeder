    This article discusses the challenges incarcerated individuals face due to the outdated technology within correctional facilities, particularly focusing on how it hinders their opportunities for parole and successful reentry into society. The author, an incarcerated individual, highlights several critical areas where technological deficiencies create significant obstacles. One major issue is the difficulty in accessing and completing rehabilitative programs. Many programs are offered online, but prisons often lack reliable internet access and sufficient computer availability, making it hard for inmates to participate and demonstrate their commitment to change. This lack of access directly impacts parole boards' decisions, as participation in these programs is often a key factor in granting release.

    Another problem is the difficulty in maintaining contact with family and support networks. Visitation can be limited by distance, cost, and logistical challenges. Phone calls are often expensive, and the quality can be poor. While video calls have become more common, they are still not universally available and can be costly. The lack of reliable communication technology strains family relationships, which are crucial for an inmate's emotional well-being and successful reintegration into society upon release. The author mentions that maintaining connections with family, especially children, is hard because of the restrictive systems they have in place.

    The article also focuses on the limitations inmates face in accessing legal resources. Legal research is increasingly conducted online, but inmates often have limited or no internet access, or are restricted only to outdated legal databases. This restricts their ability to understand their rights, file appeals, and challenge wrongful convictions. The author also highlights the difficulty in obtaining necessary documents and information to support their cases, further hindering their efforts to seek justice.

    Moreover, the outdated technology makes it harder for inmates to prepare for employment after release. Many jobs today require basic computer skills and familiarity with online tools. Inmates who lack access to technology within prison are at a disadvantage when they compete for jobs upon release. The author stresses that providing access to modern technology would help inmates develop marketable skills and increase their chances of finding employment, reducing recidivism. The author argues that investing in technology within prisons is not only a matter of fairness but also a practical step towards improving public safety. By equipping inmates with the tools they need to rehabilitate, maintain family connections, and prepare for employment, prisons can become more effective at helping individuals turn their lives around and become productive members of society.
