    <h2>Connecticut legislature overhauls towing laws to reduce &#39;predatory towing&#39;</h2>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>ProPublica reports on Connecticut's recent passage of a comprehensive towing reform law aimed at protecting vehicle owners from predatory towing practices. The legislation addresses issues such as excessive fees, lack of transparency, and inadequate notification procedures that have plagued the state for years. The new law introduces several key provisions to regulate the towing industry and provide recourse for consumers who have been unfairly charged or had their vehicles improperly towed.</p>

<p>The article highlights that the reform was prompted by numerous complaints from Connecticut residents detailing instances of exorbitant towing fees, instances of towing companies accepting only cash, and vehicles being towed from private lots without adequate signage or proper notification. These practices often left vehicle owners with significant financial burdens and limited options for disputing the charges. The new law seeks to rectify these problems by setting maximum towing rates, mandating clear signage requirements for private lots, and establishing a formal complaint process for consumers.</p>

<p>Specifically, the legislation caps the rates that towing companies can charge for various services, including initial towing fees, daily storage fees, and administrative fees. It also requires towing companies to accept multiple forms of payment, including credit and debit cards, to prevent companies from demanding cash-only payments. Furthermore, the law mandates that private property owners clearly post signage indicating that unauthorized vehicles will be towed at the owner's expense. These signs must include the towing company's contact information and a statement of the vehicle owner's rights.</p>

<p>The new law also creates a formal process for consumers to file complaints against towing companies with the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). The DMV will investigate these complaints and has the authority to impose fines or suspend the licenses of towing companies found to be in violation of the law. This provides consumers with a clear and accessible avenue for seeking redress when they believe they have been unfairly treated.</p>

<p>The reform is seen as a significant victory for consumer advocates who have long argued for greater regulation of the towing industry in Connecticut. The new law is expected to bring greater transparency, fairness, and accountability to the towing process, protecting vehicle owners from predatory practices and ensuring that they are treated fairly.</p>
