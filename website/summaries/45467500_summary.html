  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    The Swedish government has tasked the Riksbank with ensuring that offline card payments are possible in Sweden no later than 1 July 2026. This initiative aims to maintain the resilience of the payment system, ensuring that card payments can still be made even when there are disruptions to the power supply or internet connectivity.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Riksbank is responsible for overseeing the payment system in Sweden. To fulfill this assignment, the Riksbank is planning to collaborate with relevant authorities and market participants. The goal is to develop a solution that allows consumers to continue using card payments during outages, thereby ensuring that essential transactions can still be completed.

  <p>
  The Riksbank needs to consider a few things before offline card payments are possible:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Technical solutions: the technical solution for offline payments needs to be standardised and function smoothly
    </li>
    <li>
      Risk management: appropriate risk management needs to be in place for the solution
    </li>
    <li>
      User-friendliness: both consumers and merchants need to easily understand the offline payment method.
    </li>
  </ul>
