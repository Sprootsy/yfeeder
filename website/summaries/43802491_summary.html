 <p>According to a report by Cristosal, inmates in El Salvador's prisons, particularly during the state of emergency declared by President Bukele, have been subjected to torture, killings, and inhumane conditions. The report documents numerous cases of inmates being tortured, strangled, or dying due to lack of medical attention and starvation. The report highlights that the state of emergency, enacted in response to gang violence, has led to a surge in arbitrary arrests and a severe deterioration of prison conditions, with overcrowding exacerbating the problems. Families of the detained report extreme difficulties in obtaining information about their loved ones, often facing extortion and a lack of transparency from authorities. Cristosal's investigation also uncovers a pattern of deaths within the prisons that are often attributed to illness but are suspected to be linked to torture and neglect. The report criticizes the lack of due process and legal representation for detainees, further contributing to the vulnerability of the prison population. The Bukele administration's policies are presented as prioritizing security at the expense of human rights, leading to a humanitarian crisis within the prison system.</p>
