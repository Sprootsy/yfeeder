        <h1>Inmates in ElSalvador tortured/strangled-hellish conditions in Bukele&#39;s prisons (2023)</h1>

  <p>A recent report by Cristosal, a human rights organization, has documented severe human rights violations within El Salvador's prisons under President Nayib Bukele's administration. The report focuses on the period following the implementation of the state of exception in March 2022, which suspended several constitutional rights in response to a surge in gang violence. Cristosal's investigation, based on hundreds of testimonies and documentation, reveals a grim picture of systematic torture, inhumane conditions, and a lack of due process for inmates.</p>
  <p>The report details instances of inmates being subjected to brutal treatment, including beatings, electric shocks, and strangulation. Overcrowding is rampant, with prisoners confined to cramped cells without adequate ventilation, sanitation, or access to healthcare. Food and water are scarce, leading to malnutrition and dehydration. The already dire situation is exacerbated by the spread of diseases due to unsanitary conditions and a lack of medical attention.</p>
  <p>Families of the incarcerated describe the anguish of not knowing the whereabouts or condition of their loved ones. They report difficulties in obtaining information from authorities and are often denied visitation rights. The report also highlights cases of inmates dying in custody, with families alleging that deaths are often attributed to vague causes without proper investigation.</p>
  <p>The state of exception, while initially popular for its promise of curbing gang violence, has been criticized for its broad scope and lack of judicial oversight. Human rights organizations argue that the suspension of constitutional rights has created a climate of impunity, enabling authorities to commit abuses without fear of accountability. There are concerns that innocent individuals have been caught up in the crackdown, with arbitrary arrests and detentions becoming commonplace.</p>
  <p>Cristosal's report calls for an end to the state of exception and urges the Salvadoran government to respect the human rights of all citizens, including those in prison. It also calls for independent investigations into allegations of torture and other abuses, as well as accountability for perpetrators. The report serves as a stark reminder of the human cost of the government's security policies and the urgent need for reform within the country's prison system.</p>
