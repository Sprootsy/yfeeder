        <h1>Inmates in ElSalvador tortured/strangled-hellish conditions in Bukele&#39;s prisons (2023)</h1>
        <p>

 <p>A report by Cristosal, a human rights organization, details severe human rights violations, including torture and deaths, within El Salvador's prisons under President Nayib Bukele's state of exception. The report, based on hundreds of testimonies, reveals that inmates are subjected to beatings, electric shocks, starvation, and denial of medical care. Over 150 inmates have died in state custody since the measures were implemented in March 2022, with evidence suggesting many deaths were due to torture and neglect rather than natural causes. The report highlights overcrowded conditions, with prisons holding up to five times their capacity, leading to unsanitary environments and the rapid spread of diseases like tuberculosis. Detainees are often held incommunicado, making it difficult for families to locate or communicate with them. The state of exception, initially intended to combat gang violence, has been extended repeatedly, suspending key constitutional rights such as the right to defense and the presumption of innocence. This has led to mass arrests, with over 68,000 people detained, many without due process. The report also documents cases of arbitrary arrests based on appearance or neighborhood, with individuals often detained without evidence of gang affiliation. The organization has called on the international community to pressure the Salvadoran government to respect human rights and ensure due process for all detainees. The report contrasts Bukele's public image of success in reducing gang violence with the hidden reality of systemic human rights abuses within the prison system.</p>
