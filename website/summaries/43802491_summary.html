        <p>

 <h3>Summary</h3>
 <p>
  A recent report by Cristosal, a human rights organization, details horrific conditions and human rights abuses within El Salvador's prisons under President Nayib Bukele's administration. The report, based on 140 testimonies, documents systematic torture, extrajudicial killings, and inhumane treatment of inmates, particularly within the context of the "war on gangs."
 </p>
 <p>
  The report highlights the mass arrests and imprisonment of individuals, many with little or no connection to gangs, leading to severe overcrowding. Prisons are described as hellish environments, with inmates subjected to beatings, starvation, and denial of medical care.  The report also mentions instances of inmates being strangled, suffocated, or dying from untreated illnesses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cristosal's investigation points to a deliberate policy of inflicting suffering on the prison population as a means of exerting control and punishing suspected gang members.  The report raises concerns about the lack of due process and transparency in the judicial system, with many detainees held for extended periods without trial or access to legal representation.
 </p>
 <p>
  The organization calls for international scrutiny and accountability, urging the El Salvadorian government to address the human rights violations and ensure the humane treatment of prisoners. The report underscores the urgent need for independent investigations and judicial reforms to prevent further abuses and uphold the rule of law.
