<p>The provided text is a blog post by Scott Aaronson discussing the relevance of theoretical computer science, particularly quantum computing, to real-world applications and technological advancements. Aaronson expresses his frustration with the misconception that theoretical work is detached from practical concerns. He argues that many concepts initially explored in theory, such as public-key cryptography and the very idea of a universal computer, have become foundational to modern technology.</p>

<p>Aaronson highlights quantum computing as a prime example. While still in its early stages, quantum computing promises computational speedups for specific problems that are intractable for classical computers. Aaronson acknowledges the challenges in building practical quantum computers but emphasizes the potential for transformative impact if these challenges are overcome. He points out that even the pursuit of building quantum computers has already led to advancements in other fields, such as materials science and our understanding of quantum mechanics itself.</p>

<p>The post also delves into the history of computation, noting how ideas like Turing's theoretical model of a computer, initially conceived as a thought experiment, ultimately laid the groundwork for the digital revolution. Aaronson argues that theoretical explorations often anticipate future technological needs and provide the conceptual framework for addressing them. He cites examples like error-correcting codes, which are essential for reliable communication and data storage, and were developed based on theoretical insights.</p>

<p>Aaronson also touches upon the role of mathematical proof in computer science, particularly in cryptography. He emphasizes that cryptography relies on mathematical guarantees of security, which are established through rigorous proofs. This contrasts with empirical approaches that may be vulnerable to unforeseen attacks. The post underscores the importance of mathematical rigor in ensuring the reliability and security of technological systems.</p>

<p>The blog post further addresses the common criticism that theoretical computer science deals with idealized models that do not accurately reflect the complexities of the real world. Aaronson concedes that such criticisms have some validity but counters that these idealizations are often necessary for making progress on fundamental problems. He argues that theoretical models can provide valuable insights even if they do not perfectly capture all aspects of reality. He uses the example of machine learning theory, which, despite its simplifications, has led to significant advancements in practical machine learning algorithms.</p>

<p>Aaronson concludes by reiterating the importance of supporting theoretical research, even when its immediate practical applications are not apparent. He argues that theoretical computer science plays a crucial role in shaping the future of technology and that neglecting it would be shortsighted. He emphasizes that many of the technologies we take for granted today were once considered purely theoretical concepts.</p>
