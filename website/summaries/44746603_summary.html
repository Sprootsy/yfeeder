<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>The article on LazyAdmin.nl discusses setting up a UniFi OS Server at home, which allows users to run various applications like UniFi Network, Protect, and Access on dedicated hardware. This offers greater control, performance, and scalability compared to running these applications on a UniFi Cloud Key or a Dream Machine. The guide focuses on installing Ubuntu Server, which is the recommended OS, and then installing the UniFi OS on top of it. It walks through the process step-by-step, from downloading the Ubuntu Server ISO to configuring the network settings and installing the UniFi OS using the provided installation script.</p>

<p>The article begins by explaining the benefits of using a dedicated UniFi OS Server, such as increased performance, ability to handle more devices, and the flexibility to run other applications alongside the UniFi ecosystem. It also highlights that this approach provides more storage capacity for recording footage in UniFi Protect, if the user chooses to install it.</p>

<p>The first practical step involves downloading the Ubuntu Server ISO image from the official Ubuntu website and creating a bootable USB drive. The article suggests using Rufus for creating the bootable drive. It then guides the user through the Ubuntu Server installation process, emphasizing the importance of selecting the correct network interface and setting up a static IP address. The article recommends setting a static IP outside of the DHCP range of the existing router to avoid IP conflicts.</p>

<p>After the Ubuntu Server installation, the article details how to SSH into the server to proceed with the UniFi OS installation. It provides commands for updating the package lists and installing necessary dependencies like curl and apt-transport-https. The user then downloads and executes the UniFi OS installation script, which automates the rest of the installation process.</p>

<p>The script installs Docker and configures the UniFi OS containers. The article mentions that the installation process can take some time, depending on the hardware. Once the installation is complete, the user can access the UniFi OS interface through a web browser using the server's IP address. From there, the UniFi Network, Protect, and other applications can be installed and configured.</p>

<p>The article also provides helpful tips for troubleshooting common issues, such as network connectivity problems or installation failures. It emphasizes the importance of checking the server's network settings and ensuring that all dependencies are installed correctly. Furthermore, it suggests checking the Docker container logs for error messages to help diagnose issues during application installation or startup.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the article presents a comprehensive guide for setting up a UniFi OS Server at home using Ubuntu Server. It provides detailed instructions and helpful tips to ensure a successful installation and configuration, allowing users to take full advantage of the UniFi ecosystem on dedicated hardware.</p>
