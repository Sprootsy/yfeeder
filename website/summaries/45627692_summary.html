    <h2>Flowistry: An IDE plugin for Rust that focuses on relevant code</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <p>Flowistry is a Rust IDE extension that helps developers understand and debug Rust code by visualizing data flow. It uses static analysis to highlight the flow of data through a program, showing where values originate and how they are used. The tool focuses on making Rust's borrow checker and ownership system more intuitive. It offers features like backward highlighting (showing where a value comes from), forward highlighting (showing where a value is used), and suggestion mode (explaining why a borrow checker error occurs and suggesting fixes). Flowistry aims to reduce the cognitive load associated with Rust's memory management rules, making it easier to write correct and efficient code. The extension integrates with popular IDEs and provides a visual representation of data dependencies, enabling developers to trace the lifetime and mutation of variables. It is particularly useful for understanding complex codebases and resolving borrow checker errors quickly.</p>
