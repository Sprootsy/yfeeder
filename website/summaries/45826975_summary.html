   According to a report by The Information, Apple is in discussions with Google to integrate Google's Gemini AI model into the iPhone to power some AI features. This potential partnership could see Apple paying Google around $1 billion for the license to use Gemini.

   Apple has reportedly been working on its own AI models, but it seems they are looking to external sources to bolster their AI capabilities, especially regarding generative AI. They have also reportedly talked with OpenAI. The deal with Google would specifically be for features that require generative AI, such as creating images and writing text. More basic tasks would likely continue to be handled by Apple's own AI models which run locally on the device.

   This deal would impact Siri, potentially improving its capabilities with the assistance of Gemini. However, the article does not specifically state how Siri will be impacted.

   The partnership between Apple and Google would be noteworthy considering the history of competition between the two companies, particularly in the mobile space with iOS and Android. The deal could face scrutiny from regulators, given the potential implications for competition in the AI market, and both companies already face antitrust issues.
