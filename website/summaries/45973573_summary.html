  <p>The article is a podcast transcript of an interview with Becky, a software developer, who recounts her experience working on a project called "Burger" at a large company. The project aimed to modernize the company's internal systems by replacing legacy COBOL code with a modern Java-based system. Becky was initially excited to join the team, enticed by the opportunity to work on a large-scale modernization effort with modern technologies. However, the project was plagued by numerous issues from the outset, leading to its eventual failure.</p>

  <p>Becky describes a toxic and dysfunctional work environment. The project suffered from a lack of clear leadership, conflicting goals, and poor communication. The team was divided into factions, with some members clinging to the old COBOL system and resisting change, while others were enthusiastic about the new Java system but lacked sufficient understanding of the underlying business logic. The team also faced significant challenges with data migration, as the legacy COBOL data was complex and poorly documented. Despite these challenges, the team was under immense pressure to deliver the project on time and within budget, leading to long hours and burnout.</p>

  <p>The interview details specific problems such as the reliance on a "golden source" COBOL system that was poorly understood and contained business rules that were not properly documented, only existing in the minds of people who were no longer with the company. The team also struggled with the complexity of the business rules, which were intricate and often contradictory. Moreover, the testing environment was inadequate, making it difficult to identify and fix bugs. As the project progressed, the problems compounded, and the team became increasingly demoralized. Despite the team's efforts, the project ultimately failed, resulting in significant financial losses for the company and reputational damage for those involved.</p>

  <p>Becky reflects on the lessons learned from the experience, emphasizing the importance of clear communication, strong leadership, and a realistic assessment of the challenges involved in large-scale modernization projects. She also highlights the need to address cultural and organizational issues, such as resistance to change and lack of collaboration, to ensure the success of such initiatives. The interview serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of undertaking complex software projects without proper planning, execution, and leadership.</p>
