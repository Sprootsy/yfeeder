  <h2>Summary of Octofriend</h2>
  <p>Octofriend is a self-hosted AI tool designed to enhance productivity for developers, project managers, and technical writers by leveraging large language models (LLMs). It provides features such as code explanation, code generation, commit message generation, documentation generation, and project management assistance, all within a customizable and private environment.</p>

  <p>The tool offers a user-friendly web interface built with React and Material UI, allowing users to interact with the AI functionalities through chat-like interactions. It supports various LLMs, including both open-source and proprietary models like OpenAI's GPT series, accessible through APIs or local execution via llama.cpp. This flexibility enables users to choose models based on their needs, balancing performance, cost, and privacy considerations.</p>

  <p>Octofriend emphasizes security and privacy. By being self-hosted, it allows users to keep their code and data within their own infrastructure, mitigating the risks associated with sending sensitive information to third-party services. The application also supports authentication to control user access and protect the system from unauthorized use.</p>

  <p>The architecture of Octofriend includes a backend built with FastAPI that handles API requests, model execution, and data management. It incorporates a database for storing conversations and project-related information, ensuring persistence and enabling the AI to learn from previous interactions.  Octofriend also support external tools to improve the quality of the answers, like retrieving information for the current github repository to provide more accurate answers.</p>

  <p>Octofriend's features include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Code Explanation:</b>  The ability to understand and explain code snippets in natural language, aiding in comprehension and debugging.</li>
    <li><b>Code Generation:</b> Generating code based on user prompts, assisting in rapid prototyping and development.</li>
    <li><b>Commit Message Generation:</b> Automatically creating commit messages based on code changes, streamlining the development workflow.</li>
    <li><b>Documentation Generation:</b> Creating documentation from code comments and specifications, improving code maintainability.</li>
    <li><b>Project Management Assistance:</b> Helping with task management, issue tracking, and project planning.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Octofriend is designed to be extensible and customizable. Users can configure the tool to use different LLMs, adjust parameters, and integrate it with other development tools. It is intended to be a flexible and adaptable AI assistant that can be tailored to the specific needs of development teams and individual developers.</p>
