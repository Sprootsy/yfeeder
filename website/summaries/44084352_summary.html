<p>A 35-year-old man was kidnapped and tortured in Manhattan over a dispute involving cryptocurrency. The victim was lured into a van in the Flatiron District by individuals he knew, who then drove him to a warehouse in Queens. Over the course of several hours, the man was subjected to brutal torture, including being beaten, burned with a torch, and threatened with a taser and power drill. The perpetrators demanded access to the victim's cryptocurrency wallets, specifically seeking the password to his Bitcoin account. </p>

<p>The kidnappers contacted a friend of the victim, sending disturbing photographs and videos of the torture to coerce the friend into providing the Bitcoin password. The friend, terrified for the victim's life, eventually cooperated and shared the password. The criminals then transferred approximately $180,000 worth of Bitcoin from the victim's account. After obtaining the cryptocurrency, the kidnappers released the victim in Brooklyn. He was then transported to a hospital. The victim suffered severe burns and other injuries and is recovering. The investigation is ongoing.</p>
