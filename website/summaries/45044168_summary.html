  <p>This article from Brown University's Climate Development Lab investigates the legal challenges facing offshore wind projects in the Eastern United States. It examines the network of anti-offshore wind groups and the lawyers representing them, revealing connections and funding sources that support these legal efforts. The research maps the relationships between these groups, law firms, and related organizations to understand the scope and strategy of opposition to offshore wind energy development. The analysis explores how legal tactics are used to delay or halt projects, impacting the transition to renewable energy and efforts to combat climate change. The article delves into specific cases and legal arguments employed by these groups, highlighting the common themes and strategies used to challenge offshore wind development. It also identifies the individuals and organizations providing financial and logistical support to these legal campaigns. By uncovering these connections, the research aims to shed light on the organized resistance to offshore wind energy and its implications for climate policy and renewable energy deployment.</p>
