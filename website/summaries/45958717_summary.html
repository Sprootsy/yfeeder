    <h2>Run ancient UNIX on modern hardware</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <p>This GitHub repository, titled "run-ancient-unix," provides resources and instructions for emulating and running very old versions of Unix, specifically focusing on versions from the 1970s such as Unix V6, V7, and 2.11BSD. The repository aims to make these historical operating systems accessible for experimentation, learning, and preservation. It includes pre-built disk images, scripts for setting up emulators like SIMH and QEMU, and documentation to guide users through the process of booting and using these ancient systems. It also addresses potential issues and provides troubleshooting tips for common problems encountered when running these old Unix versions on modern hardware.</p>

  <h2>Key Points:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Focus on Ancient Unix Versions:</b> The repository is dedicated to running very early versions of Unix, including Unix V6, V7, and 2.11BSD.</li>
    <li><b>Emulation:</b> It relies on emulators like SIMH and QEMU to simulate the hardware environments necessary to run these operating systems.</li>
    <li><b>Pre-built Disk Images:</b>  The repository provides pre-built disk images to simplify the setup process.  Users do not have to build the operating systems from source (although this is an option).</li>
    <li><b>Setup Scripts:</b> Scripts are included to automate the configuration of the emulators and the booting of the Unix systems.</li>
    <li><b>Documentation:</b> Comprehensive documentation guides users through the process, including troubleshooting tips and explanations of potential issues.</li>
    <li><b>Accessibility:</b> The project aims to make these historical operating systems accessible for experimentation, learning, and preservation purposes.</li>
    <li><b>SIMH Emulator:</b> SIMH (a highly portable multi-system emulator) is a primary emulator used in the project.</li>
    <li><b>QEMU Emulator:</b> QEMU is also supported as an alternative emulator.</li>
    <li><b>Preservation:</b> The repository contributes to the preservation of computing history by providing a means to run and explore these early operating systems.</li>
