  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>The article "We Melted iPhones For Science" details an experiment conducted by the author and their team to recover valuable metals from iPhones using a high-temperature furnace. Driven by the increasing amount of e-waste and the presence of precious metals like gold, silver, and platinum group metals in electronics, the author sought to explore the feasibility of a DIY approach to urban mining. They describe the process of melting down iPhones in a graphite crucible within a furnace, reaching temperatures high enough to melt the various components. The resulting molten material separated into layers based on density, with heavier metals sinking to the bottom. After cooling, the resulting "button" of metals was analyzed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) to determine its composition. The experiment revealed the presence of several metals, including copper, iron, tin, nickel, and precious metals like gold and silver. However, the concentrations of precious metals were relatively low, suggesting that a significant amount was lost during the melting process, potentially due to oxidation or vaporization. The author acknowledges the limitations of their rudimentary setup and the challenges of efficiently recovering precious metals without sophisticated equipment and techniques. They also discuss the environmental considerations and potential hazards associated with melting electronics, emphasizing the importance of proper ventilation and safety precautions. Despite the modest yield of precious metals, the author concludes that the experiment provided valuable insights into the complexities of e-waste recycling and the potential for recovering valuable resources from discarded electronics. They emphasize the need for more efficient and environmentally sound methods for extracting these materials to reduce reliance on traditional mining and minimize the environmental impact of e-waste.</p>
