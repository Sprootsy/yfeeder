  <p>The article "Contributing to Open Source Should Be Required Like Jury Duty" by Josh Beckman argues that contributing to open-source software (OSS) should be a civic duty, akin to jury duty. Beckman posits that OSS is a critical part of modern infrastructure, yet its maintenance relies heavily on the voluntary efforts of a relatively small group of individuals. This creates a sustainability problem, as maintainers often face burnout and projects can become vulnerable if key contributors lose interest or move on.</p>
  <p>Beckman draws a parallel between OSS and other essential public services like infrastructure or legal systems, which are supported by mandatory contributions (taxes and jury duty, respectively). He suggests that requiring individuals with software development skills to contribute to OSS would address the sustainability issue and ensure the continued health and security of the software ecosystem. The author acknowledges the challenges of implementing such a system, including determining who should contribute, how much they should contribute, and which projects should receive contributions. He also raises concerns about potential inefficiencies and the need to avoid stifling innovation.</p>
  <p>To address these challenges, Beckman proposes a system where software developers are periodically required to dedicate a certain amount of time to OSS projects. This could be managed through a centralized platform that matches developers with projects based on their skills and the needs of the OSS community. He suggests that developers could choose which projects to contribute to, within certain guidelines, to ensure that their efforts are directed towards important and well-maintained projects. The author emphasizes the importance of proper oversight and governance to prevent abuse and ensure that contributions are effective and beneficial.</p>
  <p>Beckman also anticipates concerns about the impact on businesses that rely on software developers. He suggests that companies could be given the option to fulfill their civic duty by allowing their employees to contribute to OSS during work hours or by sponsoring OSS projects directly. This would ensure that the burden is shared equitably and that businesses can benefit from the improvements made to the software they rely on.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, Beckman advocates for a fundamental shift in how we view and support OSS. He believes that by treating it as a public good and requiring contributions from those with the necessary skills, we can ensure its long-term sustainability and security. While acknowledging the complexities of implementing such a system, he argues that the potential benefits outweigh the challenges and that it is time to start seriously considering ways to make contributing to OSS a civic duty.</p>
