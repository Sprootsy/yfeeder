  <p>
    The provided document is a textbook on discrete mathematics. It covers fundamental concepts and techniques used in computer science and mathematics. The book is structured into several chapters, each addressing a core topic within discrete math. These topics include:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Chapter 0: Preliminaries</strong> This chapter provides an introduction to mathematical language, sets, functions, and logic. It lays the groundwork for the rest of the book, ensuring that the reader is familiar with the basic building blocks of mathematical reasoning and notation. The chapter covers:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mathematical Language:</strong> Introduces notation and symbols common in mathematics.</li>
    <li><strong>Sets:</strong> Defines sets, set operations (union, intersection, complement), subsets, and power sets.</li>
    <li><strong>Functions:</strong> Explains functions, their domains and codomains, injective (one-to-one), surjective (onto), and bijective functions, and function composition.</li>
    <li><strong>Logic:</strong> Covers propositional logic, logical connectives (AND, OR, NOT, implication, biconditional), truth tables, logical equivalence, and quantifiers (universal and existential).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Chapter 1: Counting</strong> This chapter focuses on techniques for counting, which are essential in many areas of discrete mathematics and computer science. The main topics include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Basic Counting Principles:</strong> Introduces the sum rule and the product rule.</li>
    <li><strong>The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:</strong> Provides a method for counting the number of elements in the union of sets when the sets are not disjoint.</li>
    <li><strong>Permutations and Combinations:</strong> Covers arrangements and selections of objects, with and without regard to order.</li>
    <li><strong>Binomial Coefficients:</strong> Defines binomial coefficients and explores their properties, including Pascal's identity and the binomial theorem.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Chapter 2: Sequences</strong> This chapter studies sequences of numbers, focusing on recurrence relations and generating functions.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Recurrence Relations:</strong> Defines recurrence relations and methods for solving them, including linear homogeneous recurrence relations.</li>
    <li><strong>Generating Functions:</strong> Introduces generating functions as a tool for solving recurrence relations and counting problems.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Chapter 3: Graph Theory</strong> This chapter introduces graphs as mathematical structures for modeling relationships between objects.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Basic Definitions:</strong> Defines graphs, vertices, edges, directed and undirected graphs, and graph isomorphism.</li>
    <li><strong>Paths and Circuits:</strong> Covers paths, cycles, Eulerian and Hamiltonian paths and circuits.</li>
    <li><strong>Trees:</strong> Defines trees, spanning trees, and their properties.</li>
    <li><strong>Graph Coloring:</strong> Introduces graph coloring and chromatic number.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The book provides numerous examples and exercises to help readers understand and apply the concepts. It is designed to be accessible to students with a basic background in mathematics and is suitable for use in introductory discrete mathematics courses.
