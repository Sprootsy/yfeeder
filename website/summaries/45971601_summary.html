  <p>The Financial Times article discusses the growing tensions between the US and China over Taiwan, particularly focusing on the economic dimensions and the potential for weaponizing economic interdependence. It highlights concerns in Washington regarding China's increasing military assertiveness towards Taiwan, coupled with its economic influence, which could deter the US and its allies from intervening in a potential conflict. The article emphasizes the Biden administration's efforts to strengthen Taiwan's defenses and deepen economic ties with the island, while also working with allies to present a united front against potential Chinese aggression.</p>
  <p>The piece delves into the debate within US policy circles about the appropriate strategy to deter China. Some advocate for a policy of "active denial," which involves bolstering Taiwan's military capabilities and making it a more difficult target for invasion. Others call for stronger economic measures, including sanctions and export controls, to raise the costs for China should it choose to attack. The article notes the complexities of economic coercion, as China's economy is deeply intertwined with the global economy, and any measures could have significant repercussions for the US and its allies. It mentions that war games simulating a Chinese invasion of Taiwan have shown the importance of economic measures in deterring or responding to such an event.</p>
  <p>The article also points out the vulnerabilities in critical supply chains, particularly in semiconductors, where Taiwan plays a dominant role. The US is trying to reduce its reliance on Taiwan for these essential components by encouraging domestic production and diversifying supply sources. Furthermore, it touches upon the US government's efforts to coordinate with allies, such as Japan and the EU, to develop a coordinated response to any potential Chinese aggression. This includes aligning sanctions policies and exploring ways to reduce economic dependencies on China. The piece concludes by emphasizing the need for a comprehensive strategy that combines military deterrence with economic resilience and diplomatic coordination to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
