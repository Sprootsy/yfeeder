  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>
    The article discusses the concept of air-gapped environments and their implementation with Plane, an open-source project management tool. Air-gapping refers to isolating a computer network from the public internet and other unsecured networks, creating a secure environment for sensitive data and operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article begins by explaining what air-gapping is, highlighting its primary purpose of preventing unauthorized access and data breaches. It outlines common use cases for air-gapped environments, such as protecting classified government information, financial data, and critical infrastructure systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, the article describes traditional methods of setting up air-gapped environments, noting their complexity and high costs. These methods typically involve physically isolating systems, implementing strict access controls, and manually transferring data using physical media like USB drives.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article then introduces Plane and explains how it can be deployed in an air-gapped environment. It describes the process of setting up Plane in such an environment, which includes downloading necessary dependencies, transferring them to the isolated network, configuring Plane, and managing data synchronization. Plane's architecture, with its separation of concerns and modular design, facilitates air-gapped deployment.
  </p>
  <p>
    The benefits of using Plane in an air-gapped setup are emphasized, including enhanced security, compliance with regulatory requirements, and the ability to collaborate on projects within a secure environment. The article also acknowledges the challenges associated with maintaining an air-gapped Plane instance, such as the need for manual updates and the complexity of data transfer.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article provides a detailed walkthrough of setting up Plane in an air-gapped environment, covering the necessary steps for downloading, transferring, and installing the required components. It also includes information on configuring Plane to function correctly within the isolated network and managing data synchronization between the air-gapped environment and any external systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, the article concludes by reiterating the importance of air-gapping for organizations with strict security requirements and positioning Plane as a viable solution for project management within these environments. It also hints at future enhancements to Plane that will further simplify its deployment and management in air-gapped networks.
