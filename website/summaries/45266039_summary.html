<p>The article on Noctua's website discusses how to optimize the Framework Laptop Desktop kit for quieter operation. It focuses on reducing noise levels through various adjustments and component choices, primarily related to cooling. The article highlights that the Framework Laptop, while generally quiet, can still benefit from further noise reduction, especially when used in a desktop setting where ambient noise might be lower.</p>

<p>The article starts by acknowledging the Framework Laptop's already decent noise performance. However, it emphasizes that in a desktop environment, even subtle noises can become more noticeable. The primary focus of the guide is to minimize fan noise, which is typically the most significant contributor to the system's overall sound profile.</p>

<p>The initial step involves selecting the right fan control profile within the Framework Laptop's BIOS. The article recommends experimenting with different profiles (Quiet, Balanced, Performance) to find the optimal balance between cooling performance and noise. The 'Quiet' profile is generally suggested as a starting point for users prioritizing silence. For further customization, the article suggests using utilities like Fan Control to create custom fan curves tailored to specific user preferences and workloads. These custom curves allow users to set precise fan speeds based on temperature readings, ensuring that the fans only spin up when necessary.</p>

<p>Beyond software adjustments, the article discusses hardware modifications to improve cooling efficiency. A key recommendation is to replace the stock thermal paste with a higher-quality alternative, such as Noctua's NT-H1 or NT-H2. Higher quality thermal paste can improve heat transfer from the CPU to the heatsink, potentially lowering CPU temperatures and reducing the need for aggressive fan speeds. The article provides detailed instructions on how to properly apply thermal paste, emphasizing the importance of a thin, even layer to avoid air gaps.</p>

<p>Another hardware-related suggestion involves considering the ambient temperature of the environment where the Framework Laptop Desktop kit is used. Lower ambient temperatures naturally reduce the cooling demands on the system, allowing the fans to run at lower speeds or even remain off for longer periods. The article recommends ensuring adequate ventilation around the desktop kit to prevent heat buildup, especially in enclosed spaces.</p>

<p>The article also touches upon the importance of regularly cleaning the fan and heatsink to maintain optimal cooling performance. Dust accumulation can impede airflow and reduce the efficiency of the cooling system, leading to higher temperatures and increased fan speeds. The article recommends using compressed air to remove dust from the fan blades and heatsink fins.</p>

<p>The article briefly mentions undervolting the CPU as a more advanced technique to reduce heat output. Undervolting involves reducing the voltage supplied to the CPU, which can lower its power consumption and operating temperature without significantly impacting performance. However, the article cautions that undervolting requires careful experimentation and stability testing, as incorrect settings can lead to system instability.</p>

<p>Finally, the article suggests monitoring CPU temperatures using software tools to assess the effectiveness of the implemented noise reduction measures. By tracking temperatures under various workloads, users can fine-tune their fan curves and thermal paste application to achieve the best possible balance between cooling performance and noise levels.</p>
