    The AFL-CIO's annual Executive Paywatch report, released on July 23, 2025, examines the compensation packages of CEOs at S&amp;P 500 companies and compares them to the median pay of their employees. The report highlights the disparity between executive and worker compensation, arguing that it reflects a broader issue of economic inequality in the United States.

    According to the report, in 2024, the average CEO of an S&amp;P 500 company earned significantly more than their median employee. The report suggests that while corporate profits have soared, worker wages have stagnated, leading to an ever-widening gap between the highest earners and the average worker.

    The AFL-CIO uses the Executive Paywatch report to advocate for policies aimed at curbing excessive executive compensation and promoting fair wages for all workers. They argue for measures such as increased corporate taxes, stronger regulations on executive pay, and enhanced collective bargaining rights for employees. The report emphasizes that these measures are necessary to create a more equitable economy where the benefits of economic growth are shared more broadly.

    The report also scrutinizes specific companies and industries, highlighting those with the most extreme CEO-to-worker pay ratios. By naming names, the AFL-CIO aims to hold corporations accountable for their compensation practices and encourage them to address the pay gap. They believe that public pressure and increased awareness can lead to changes in corporate behavior and a more just distribution of wealth.

    In addition to analyzing pay ratios, the Executive Paywatch report examines the structure of executive compensation packages, including salaries, bonuses, stock options, and other benefits. It questions whether these packages are truly aligned with long-term company performance or if they incentivize short-term gains at the expense of workers and the broader economy. The report calls for greater transparency and accountability in executive compensation decisions, urging boards of directors to prioritize the interests of all stakeholders, not just top executives.
