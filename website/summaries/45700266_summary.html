    <h2>Vibe Coding in the 90s</h2>

  <p>The article is a nostalgic look back at the experience of coding in the 1990s, contrasting it with modern software development practices. It emphasizes the unique challenges and rewards of that era, highlighting the constraints of limited resources, slower hardware, and less sophisticated tools. The author reminisces about the process of writing code on machines with significantly less processing power and memory compared to today's computers. Debugging was a more involved process, often requiring meticulous examination of assembly code and relying on print statements instead of advanced debuggers. The author also describes the collaborative aspects of software development in the 90s, with developers often sharing code snippets and knowledge through physical media like floppy disks or over dial-up connections. This close collaboration fostered a sense of community and shared problem-solving.</p>
  <p>A key theme is the resourcefulness required to overcome limitations. The author discusses techniques like optimizing code for speed and memory usage, carefully managing resources, and finding creative solutions to technical problems. There was a strong focus on understanding the underlying hardware and software architecture to squeeze the most performance out of available resources. This deep understanding often came from necessity, as developers had to work within strict constraints. The author also talks about the different programming languages and tools that were prevalent during that time, such as C, C++, and assembly language. These languages were often used to write performance-critical code, while other tools like debuggers and profilers were less advanced than their modern counterparts.</p>
  <p>The article also contrasts the development environment of the 90s with the current era of abundant resources and sophisticated tools. Modern developers have access to powerful IDEs, extensive libraries, and cloud-based services that simplify many aspects of software development. However, the author suggests that the constraints of the 90s fostered a deeper understanding of computer science principles and a greater appreciation for efficiency. While modern tools enable faster development cycles and more complex projects, the author argues that the experience of coding in the 90s instilled a valuable sense of resourcefulness and problem-solving skills. In addition, version control was less mature, which meant it was harder to work on the same code. In general, because the tools were worse, communication was even more important.</p>
  <p>Finally, the author reflects on the unique atmosphere of the 90s tech scene, characterized by a spirit of innovation and a sense of excitement about the potential of computing. Despite the limitations, there was a strong belief in the transformative power of technology and a willingness to experiment with new ideas. This pioneering spirit, combined with the challenges of the era, created a distinctive "vibe" that shaped the careers and perspectives of many developers who started their careers in the 1990s. The article also mentions the prevalence of shareware and the culture of distributing software through bulletin board systems (BBS) or physical media, allowing small teams and individuals to reach a wider audience.</p>
