 <h2>Summary</h2>
 <p>
  The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo collaborations have detected the most massive black hole merger observed to date, a cosmic event labeled GW200129. This event involved the collision of two black holes, one with a mass approximately 40 times that of our sun and the other with a mass around 85 times that of the sun. The resulting black hole formed from this merger has a mass of about 120 times the mass of the sun. This event occurred roughly 9 billion years ago.

  The black hole with 85 solar masses is particularly intriguing because it falls within a range where black holes are not expected to form through the direct collapse of a star. This mass range, between 65 and 120 solar masses, is known as the "pair-instability mass gap." The pair-instability phenomenon arises in very massive stars, where photons inside the star convert into electron-positron pairs. This process reduces the radiation pressure within the star, leading to collapse and subsequent explosion, preventing black hole formation in this mass range.

  The existence of a black hole within the pair-instability mass gap suggests alternative formation scenarios. One possibility is that this black hole formed through the merger of smaller black holes. Another theory proposes that the black hole might have originated from a star that underwent multiple episodes of mass shedding, preventing it from ever reaching the pair-instability range.

  The GW200129 event is also notable for its relatively large distance from Earth, making it the most distant black hole merger observed by LIGO and Virgo. Analyzing such distant events provides valuable insights into the formation and evolution of black holes throughout the universe's history. The detection of GW200129 contributes to a growing catalog of gravitational wave events, helping scientists better understand the population of black holes and their formation mechanisms.

  The observations were made during the first half of LIGO and Virgo's third observing run (O3a). The event provides additional evidence for the existence of black holes in the pair-instability mass gap and supports the idea that black holes can form through various channels, including mergers of smaller black holes and potentially through modified stellar evolution processes. Further study of these events promises to reveal more about the life cycle of stars and the formation of black holes.
