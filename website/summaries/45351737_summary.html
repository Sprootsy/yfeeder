<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The Privacy Commissioner of Canada, Philippe Dufresne, has launched a consultation on generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This consultation aims to gather insights to inform the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC)'s guidance and advice on how Canadian privacy law applies to these rapidly evolving technologies. The OPC recognizes the significant privacy risks and opportunities presented by generative AI, noting its potential to transform various aspects of life while also raising concerns about the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information.</p>
<p>The consultation focuses on key areas such as:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> How can individuals be informed about when they are interacting with generative AI systems and how their data is being used?</li>
<li><strong>Consent:</strong> How can meaningful consent be obtained for the collection and use of personal information by generative AI systems?</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> How can the accuracy and reliability of outputs generated by AI systems be ensured, especially when dealing with personal information?</li>
<li><strong>Bias and Discrimination:</strong> How can biases in data and algorithms be identified and mitigated to prevent discriminatory outcomes?</li>
<li><strong>Security Safeguards:</strong> What security measures are necessary to protect personal information processed by generative AI systems from unauthorized access and use?</li>
<li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Who is responsible for ensuring that generative AI systems comply with Canadian privacy law?</li>
</ol>
<p>The OPC is seeking input from a wide range of stakeholders, including technology developers, businesses, researchers, civil society organizations, and the public. The consultation period will run until October 28, 2024. The feedback received will help the OPC develop practical guidance and recommendations to ensure that generative AI systems are developed and used in a manner that respects Canadians' privacy rights.</p>
<p>Commissioner Dufresne emphasizes the importance of addressing privacy considerations proactively to foster responsible innovation in the field of AI. The goal is to enable the benefits of generative AI while safeguarding individuals' fundamental right to privacy.</p>
