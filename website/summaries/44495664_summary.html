<div>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The article discusses the use of facial recognition technology by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to identify protesters, activists, and migrants on U.S. streets. It highlights how ICE is repurposing technology initially intended for border security to conduct surveillance within the country. This raises concerns about privacy violations, civil liberties, and the potential for misuse of this technology. The article emphasizes the lack of transparency surrounding ICE's use of facial recognition and the potential for it to be used to target individuals based on their political beliefs or immigration status. It also points out the risks associated with the technology's accuracy, potentially leading to misidentification and unjust targeting of innocent people. The author is very concerned about the slippery slope of such technologies and how they will be used in the future.</p>
