  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    According to Reuters, the White House has stated that the United States will not send officials to the COP30 climate talks in Brazil in 2025 because it overlaps with the Presidential Inauguration. This is because the US Presidential Inauguration is scheduled for January 20, 2025, which clashes with the climate summit. This scheduling conflict prevents U.S. officials from participating in the COP30 event in person.
