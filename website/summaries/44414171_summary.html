  <p>The article is a personal reflection on the author's experience with a specific type of interview question focused on problem-solving and system design, often encountered in software engineering interviews. The author refers to this as a "VJepa" question, named after a specific interviewer or style of interviewing they encountered. The central theme revolves around the author's realization that directly jumping into coding or providing specific solutions is often the wrong approach. Instead, the key is to engage in a thorough and structured discussion to clarify the problem's scope, constraints, and desired outcomes. The author initially struggled with these types of questions, feeling pressure to provide immediate technical solutions. However, through experience and reflection, they learned the importance of slowing down, asking clarifying questions, and actively collaborating with the interviewer to define the problem effectively. This involves understanding the use cases, scale requirements, potential edge cases, and trade-offs involved in different design choices. The author emphasizes that the interviewer is not necessarily looking for a single "correct" answer, but rather assessing the candidate's ability to think critically, communicate clearly, and make informed decisions under ambiguous circumstances. The piece underscores the significance of communication and collaboration in problem-solving, particularly in a software engineering context where requirements are often fluid and open to interpretation. The author advocates for a proactive approach, where the candidate takes the lead in shaping the problem and guiding the discussion toward a mutually understood solution space. They also highlight the need to consider different perspectives and potential biases, ensuring that the proposed solution is robust and addresses the core needs of the user or system.</p>
