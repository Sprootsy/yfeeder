<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The article discusses a record-breaking distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that peaked at 7.3 terabits per second (Tbps), targeting an undisclosed customer of Akamai. This attack is notable for its sheer scale, dwarfing previous DDoS attacks and representing a significant escalation in the volume of junk traffic used to overwhelm targeted systems. The article emphasizes the challenges involved in mitigating such massive attacks and highlights the increasing sophistication and intensity of DDoS attacks in general. The attack was characterized by a high packet rate (over 800 million packets per second), which further complicated mitigation efforts. The article does not specify the exact nature of the targeted site or the motives behind the attack, but it underscores the growing threat that large-scale DDoS attacks pose to online services and infrastructure. It also notes that while volumetric attacks like this are becoming more common, application-layer attacks that target specific vulnerabilities remain a persistent concern.</p>
