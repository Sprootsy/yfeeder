     The mandate comes as a response to increasing concerns about bias in news reporting and a desire to maintain Law360's reputation for accuracy and fairness. The AI tool analyzes text for loaded language, framing issues, and potential slanting of information, providing reporters with feedback on areas that may be perceived as biased. Reporters are expected to review the AI's suggestions and make appropriate revisions to their stories.

Training sessions and support are being provided to help reporters effectively integrate the AI tool into their writing process.
