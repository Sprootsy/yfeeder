<p>The Financial Times article discusses the increasing pressure on global supply chains due to various factors, including geopolitical tensions, the COVID-19 pandemic, and climate change. The article highlights how these disruptions are forcing companies to rethink their sourcing and manufacturing strategies, moving away from a reliance on single suppliers and just-in-time inventory management. Reshoring or nearshoring production to reduce geographical distance and increase control over supply chains is also discussed. The piece further explores the role of technology, such as AI and data analytics, in improving supply chain visibility and resilience. Ultimately, the article conveys that the future of global supply chains will be characterized by diversification, regionalization, and increased investment in technology to navigate an increasingly uncertain and volatile world.</p>
