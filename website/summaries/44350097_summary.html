    <h2>GOP omnibus bill would sell off USPS&#39;s EVs</h2>

<div>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The article discusses a potential controversy surrounding the United States Postal Service's (USPS) procurement of new delivery vehicles. Specifically, it focuses on the possibility that some of the trucks, manufactured by Oshkosh Defense, could be assembled in Mexico to avoid paying U.S. taxes. This issue has drawn attention due to former President Donald Trump's previous scrutiny of USPS operations and his emphasis on keeping manufacturing jobs within the United States. The potential shift of production to Mexico raises concerns about the impact on American jobs and whether it aligns with the broader goals of supporting domestic manufacturing. The USPS's decision to modernize its fleet has already faced criticism related to the initial selection of primarily gasoline-powered vehicles instead of electric ones, a decision that was later revised to include a larger proportion of electric vehicles. The prospect of some vehicles being assembled in Mexico adds another layer of complexity to the situation, potentially igniting political debate and further scrutiny of the USPS's contracting practices. The article also touches on the broader implications for American manufacturing and the ongoing debate about trade policies and their effects on domestic employment.</p>
