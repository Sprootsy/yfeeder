  <p>The article "It's Rude to Show AI Output to People" by Dzianis Tankovich on distantprovince.by argues that directly presenting AI-generated content to others is often impolite and ineffective. The author contends that while AI tools can be useful for various tasks, their raw output is typically unrefined and requires significant human editing and contextualization to be truly valuable and presentable.</p>

  <p>Tankovich begins by stating that AI, despite its advancements, is still a tool, not a replacement for human thought and effort. He illustrates this with examples such as using AI to write code or generate text. While AI can produce a starting point, the output is frequently buggy, poorly structured, or tonally inappropriate. He stresses that simply showing this unedited output to another person is akin to presenting a rough draft and expecting them to decipher its meaning and value.</p>

  <p>The author highlights several reasons why showcasing raw AI output is considered rude. First, it implies a lack of effort on the part of the presenter. By not refining the AI's work, the presenter is essentially offloading the burden of understanding and improving the content onto the recipient. This can be seen as disrespectful of the recipient's time and expertise.</p>

  <p>Second, the article argues that raw AI output often lacks the necessary context and nuance to be easily understood. AI models generate content based on patterns and data, but they often miss the subtleties of human communication. This can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations, requiring the recipient to expend extra effort to fill in the gaps.</p>

  <p>Third, Tankovich points out that AI-generated content can sometimes be nonsensical or factually incorrect. Presenting such content without verification or correction can damage the presenter's credibility and waste the recipient's time. It also demonstrates a lack of critical thinking and attention to detail.</p>

  <p>The article suggests that instead of directly presenting AI output, individuals should use AI as a tool to enhance their own work. This involves carefully reviewing and editing the AI's output, adding context and nuance, and ensuring accuracy. The final product should be a polished and refined piece that reflects the presenter's own understanding and effort.</p>

  <p>Tankovich uses an analogy of asking someone to review your code. You wouldn't show them code that is unformatted and has obvious errors. Rather, you would clean it up, format it and make sure there are no obvious errors before asking someone to review it. The same principle applies to the use of AI-generated content.</p>
  
  <p>In conclusion, the author advocates for a responsible and thoughtful approach to using AI tools. He emphasizes that AI should be seen as a partner in the creative process, not a replacement for human input. By investing the time and effort to refine AI-generated content, individuals can create more valuable and meaningful work that is respectful of their audience.</p>
