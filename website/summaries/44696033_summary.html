  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
   The article "What Went Wrong for Yahoo?" analyzes the factors that led to Yahoo's decline from a dominant internet company to its eventual acquisition by Verizon. It argues that a series of strategic missteps, missed opportunities, and internal challenges contributed to Yahoo's downfall.

   One of the primary issues highlighted is Yahoo's failure to capitalize on key technological trends and emerging markets. The article points to Yahoo's initial hesitation and eventual mismanaged attempts to enter the search engine market, allowing Google to gain a significant advantage. Similarly, Yahoo missed the boat on social media, failing to acquire Facebook when it had the chance and struggling to create a successful social platform of its own.

   The article also discusses Yahoo's acquisition strategy, which was often characterized by overpaying for companies that didn't align with its core business or integrate well into its existing ecosystem. Examples include the acquisition of Geocities and Broadcast.com, which ultimately didn't deliver the expected returns. The constant change in strategic direction and leadership also created instability and hindered Yahoo's ability to execute a consistent long-term plan. The revolving door of CEOs, each with their own vision, led to internal conflicts and a lack of clear focus.

   Furthermore, the article touches upon Yahoo's internal culture and bureaucracy. It suggests that Yahoo became slow-moving and risk-averse, stifling innovation and hindering its ability to compete with more agile startups. This internal environment made it difficult for talented employees to thrive and contributed to a loss of morale.

   In contrast, the article praises some of Yahoo's early successes, such as its pioneering role in creating a comprehensive web portal and its ability to attract a large user base. However, it emphasizes that Yahoo failed to adapt to the changing landscape of the internet and ultimately lost its way.
