<p>According to testing done by Ars Technica, games run faster on SteamOS than on Windows 11. The testing was conducted on identical hardware, specifically an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, across a variety of games. The results consistently showed SteamOS outperforming Windows 11 in frame rates. In some cases, the performance difference was marginal, while in others, it was more significant.</p>

<p>The article explores several possible reasons for this performance advantage. One factor could be the leaner nature of SteamOS, which is a Linux-based operating system specifically designed for gaming and lacks much of the background processes and bloatware often found in Windows. This allows SteamOS to dedicate more resources to the game itself. Furthermore, Valve has been actively optimizing SteamOS and its Proton compatibility layer (which allows Windows games to run on Linux) for performance. The article also mentions that the newer versions of Proton have been specifically optimized for the tested hardware.</p>

<p>Another contributing factor could be the graphics drivers. While Nvidia drivers are generally considered mature and well-optimized for Windows, the Linux drivers have been steadily improving. It's possible that the specific combination of hardware, game, and driver version used in the testing favored the Linux drivers in some cases. In addition, the article points out that Windows 11 is known to have issues with background processes and other services that can consume resources and impact gaming performance.</p>

<p>The testing methodology involved running each game multiple times on both operating systems and averaging the frame rates. The article details the specific games tested and the settings used. The testers also monitored CPU and GPU utilization to gain insights into how each operating system was managing resources. While the article acknowledges that these results may not be universally applicable to all games and hardware configurations, it provides compelling evidence that SteamOS can offer a performance advantage over Windows 11 in certain scenarios.</p>

<p>The findings are significant for gamers, particularly those considering building a dedicated gaming PC or using a Steam Deck (which runs on SteamOS). The article suggests that SteamOS could be a viable alternative to Windows 11 for gamers seeking optimal performance. It also highlights the ongoing progress in Linux gaming and the potential for further performance improvements in the future.</p>
