    <h2>ICE Wants to Build Out a 24/7 Social Media Surveillance Team</h2>

<p>The article discusses how US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is expanding its surveillance capabilities through a $35.7 million contract with Thomson Reuters. This contract grants ICE agents access to a vast trove of personal data collected by private companies. This data includes location information gathered from smartphones, license plate recognition data, and detailed background checks. This level of surveillance operates largely in the shadows, with limited transparency or oversight.</p>

<p>The contract consolidates ICE's access to various data sources into a single platform, significantly enhancing the agency's ability to track and monitor individuals, including not only those suspected of crimes but also their families, friends, and broader communities. This raises concerns about the potential for mass surveillance and the erosion of privacy rights. Civil liberties advocates argue that such unfettered access to personal data violates fundamental constitutional protections and could lead to discriminatory targeting.</p>

<p>The use of third-party data brokers allows ICE to circumvent legal restrictions that would otherwise apply if the agency directly collected this information. By purchasing data from private companies, ICE avoids the need for warrants or judicial oversight in many cases. The data brokers aggregate information from a wide array of sources, including social media, financial records, and real-time location data from cell phones, creating detailed profiles of individuals. This comprehensive surveillance apparatus poses a significant threat to civil liberties and democratic accountability.</p>

<p>The article highlights the lack of transparency surrounding ICE's data collection practices, as much of this surveillance occurs without public knowledge or congressional scrutiny. This lack of oversight raises concerns about potential abuses and the absence of safeguards to protect individuals' privacy. The contract with Thomson Reuters represents a substantial expansion of ICE's surveillance capabilities, furthering the agency's capacity to monitor and track individuals on a massive scale, with profound implications for privacy rights and civil liberties in the United States.</p>
