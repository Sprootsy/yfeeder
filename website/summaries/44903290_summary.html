    According to PinkNews, Meta has removed a deepfake video of trans activist Robby Starbuck from its platforms, Facebook and Instagram. The video was created using artificial intelligence (AI) and depicted Starbuck making false and defamatory statements. Starbuck, known for his anti-transgender activism, confirmed that the video was fake and that he never made the statements attributed to him in the AI-generated video.

    Meta's decision to remove the video followed a review by its content moderation team, which determined that the video violated the company's policies against defamation and the use of AI to create misleading content. The company has been under increasing pressure to address the growing threat of AI-generated misinformation, particularly deepfakes, which can be used to spread false information and damage reputations.
