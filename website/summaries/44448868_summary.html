<p>The U.S. government has released its Fifth National Climate Assessment, detailing the intensifying impacts of climate change across the nation. The report, mandated by Congress, emphasizes that climate change is not a future threat but a present reality, with every U.S. region already experiencing its effects. It warns of escalating risks to human health, the economy, and ecosystems. The assessment highlights that the Southeast is particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures and hurricanes, while the Southwest faces severe water shortages. Coastal communities are grappling with increased flooding, and the Midwest's agricultural productivity is threatened. The report stresses that while some actions to reduce emissions and adapt to the changing climate are underway, they are insufficient to avoid the most severe consequences. It also underscores the disproportionate impact of climate change on marginalized communities, exacerbating existing inequalities. The assessment calls for urgent and substantial action to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and build resilience to the unavoidable impacts of climate change.</p>
