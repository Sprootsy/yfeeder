        <h1>Curry: A functional logic programming language</h1>
        <p>
<div>
  <p>The Curry programming language is a functional logic programming language that combines features from both functional programming (like Haskell) and logic programming (like Prolog). This combination allows programmers to utilize functions, which map inputs to outputs, and logic variables, which can be used to represent unknown values and are determined through constraint solving and search. Curry aims to provide a unified declarative programming model.</p>

  <p>One of the key features of Curry is its support for demand-driven evaluation, which means that expressions are only evaluated when their values are actually needed. This lazy evaluation strategy, inherited from functional programming, can improve efficiency by avoiding unnecessary computations and allows for dealing with infinite data structures. Curry also supports non-deterministic computations using features derived from logic programming, like search and constraint solving. This means that a Curry program can explore multiple possible solutions to a problem and return all valid solutions.</p>

  <p>Curry supports higher-order functions, meaning that functions can be passed as arguments to other functions or returned as results. This enables powerful abstractions and code reuse. The language also has a type system, which helps to catch errors at compile time. It incorporates features like polymorphic types and type classes for further type safety and abstraction.</p>

  <p>Curry can be used for a variety of applications including:
    <ul>
      <li>Symbolic computation</li>
      <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
      <li>Web applications</li>
      <li>Database programming</li>
      <li>Compiler construction</li>
      <li>Educational purposes</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Curry's syntax is similar to Haskell, making it relatively easy for programmers familiar with functional programming to learn. It has features for defining data types, functions, and modules. The language also supports concurrent programming through the use of threads and synchronization mechanisms.</p>

  <p>In summary, Curry is designed to be a versatile and powerful programming language that combines the benefits of functional and logic programming paradigms, providing a flexible and expressive environment for developing a wide range of applications.
