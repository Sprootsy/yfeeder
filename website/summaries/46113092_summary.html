<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>Instagram chief Adam Mosseri announced that the company will require employees to return to the office for at least five days a week starting in the second half of 2025. This decision marks a shift from Meta's current policy, which allows many employees to work remotely. Mosseri cited the need for improved connection and collaboration as the primary reasons for the change. He believes that in-person interaction is essential for fostering a strong company culture and driving innovation. The announcement has sparked internal debate, with some employees expressing concerns about the impact on work-life balance and flexibility.</p>

<p>Mosseri addressed employee questions and concerns during an internal meeting, emphasizing that the decision was not taken lightly. He acknowledged that the transition would require adjustments and that the company would work to support employees through the change. The return-to-office mandate is part of a broader trend among tech companies reassessing remote work policies in the post-pandemic era. While some companies are embracing hybrid or fully remote models, others are emphasizing the benefits of in-person collaboration. Meta's overall approach to remote work remains flexible for many employees, but Instagram's stricter policy reflects the leadership's belief that a more concentrated in-office presence is necessary for the platform's continued success and innovation.</p>

<p>The move is also seen as a way to strengthen team cohesion and ensure that new employees are properly integrated into the company culture. Mosseri highlighted the importance of mentorship and spontaneous interactions, which are more easily facilitated in a physical office environment. The specific implementation details of the policy, such as which teams will be prioritized and how attendance will be tracked, are still being worked out. However, the overall message is clear: Instagram is prioritizing in-person collaboration as a key driver of its future growth.</p>
