    <h2>Yes-rs: A fast, memory-safe rewrite of the classic Unix yes command</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <p>The article is about <code>yes-rs</code>, a fast <code>yes</code> command implementation written in Rust. The <code>yes</code> command repeatedly outputs a string (by default, "y") to standard output until it is killed. The <code>yes-rs</code> project aims to provide a highly optimized version of this utility.</p>

  <h3>Key Points:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><code>yes-rs</code> is a <code>yes</code> command implementation written in Rust.</li>
    <li>The primary function of a <code>yes</code> command is to continuously output a string.</li>
    <li>The goal of <code>yes-rs</code> is to offer a performant alternative to existing <code>yes</code> implementations.</li>
  </ul>
