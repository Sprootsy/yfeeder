    The article announces the general availability of Rocky Linux support for the RISC-V architecture. This includes cloud images and packages for the community, and is available across all supported regions. This milestone marks a significant expansion of Rocky Linux's support for diverse architectures, providing the community with greater flexibility and choice.
  </p>
  <p>
    The RISC-V port was made possible through the collaboration with several organizations and individuals within the Rocky Linux community. Key contributions and support came from Ampere Computing, Aliyun, IHEP (Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences), and others who provided infrastructure, hardware, and expertise.

    The availability of Rocky Linux on RISC-V aims to address the increasing demand for open-source operating systems on this architecture. RISC-V, being an open and modular instruction set architecture (ISA), offers significant advantages in terms of customization, control, and innovation. This makes it attractive for a wide range of applications, from embedded systems to high-performance computing.
