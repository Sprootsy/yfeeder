        <h1>Are ChatGPT and co harming human intelligence?</h1>
        <p>

  <p>This article in The Guardian, published April 19, 2025, explores the potential negative impacts of AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, on human intelligence and society. It argues that instead of focusing solely on the benefits AI can provide, we must critically examine the subtle yet profound ways it is already shaping our cognitive abilities, social interactions, and cultural landscape.</p>

  <p>The author contends that while AI tools offer convenience and efficiency, over-reliance on them may lead to a decline in critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and creativity. The article suggests that constantly outsourcing cognitive tasks to AI could atrophy our own mental faculties, making us increasingly dependent on these technologies and less capable of independent thought.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the piece raises concerns about the potential for AI to homogenize thought and expression. Because LLMs are trained on vast datasets of existing text and information, they tend to generate outputs that conform to established patterns and norms. This could stifle originality and innovation, leading to a more uniform and less diverse intellectual environment. The article warns that the ease with which AI can produce text and content may also contribute to information overload and the spread of misinformation, making it harder to distinguish between credible sources and fabricated narratives.</p>

  <p>The article also discusses the implications of AI for human relationships and social connection. It suggests that relying on AI for communication and companionship could erode our ability to form genuine connections with others. The author questions whether AI-generated content can truly replicate the nuance, empathy, and emotional intelligence that are essential for meaningful human interaction. There are concerns that AI-driven entertainment and social media platforms could further fragment society by creating filter bubbles and echo chambers, reinforcing existing biases and limiting exposure to diverse perspectives.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, the article urges readers to adopt a more critical and cautious approach to AI. Instead of blindly embracing these technologies, we need to carefully consider their potential consequences for human intelligence, creativity, and social well-being. The author calls for a broader public discourse on the ethical and societal implications of AI, with the goal of developing policies and practices that promote responsible innovation and safeguard our shared future.</p>
