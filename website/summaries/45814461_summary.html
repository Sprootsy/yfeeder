    <h2>Amazon Demands Perplexity Stop AI Agent from Making Purchases</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <p>Summary:</p>
  <p>Amazon has demanded that Perplexity AI cease its AI-powered shopping agent's ability to make purchases, alleging that the feature infringes on Amazon's trademarks and trade dress. Amazon contends that Perplexity's "shopping agent" uses a modified version of Amazon's product listings and imitates Amazon's website design, creating a confusingly similar experience for consumers. This, Amazon argues, could mislead customers into believing that Perplexity's shopping agent is affiliated with or endorsed by Amazon. The dispute centers on Perplexity's AI agent feature, which allows users to ask the AI to find and purchase products online. Amazon claims that the agent is essentially scraping Amazon's product information and using it to create a shopping experience that mimics Amazon's, potentially diverting customers and revenue from Amazon's platform. Amazon sent a cease-and-desist letter to Perplexity, demanding that it immediately stop the AI agent from making purchases and cease using Amazon's trademarks and trade dress. The legal battle is the latest example of tension between large tech companies and AI startups as AI tools increasingly rely on existing data and content to power their features.</p>
