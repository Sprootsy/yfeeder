   <h3>Summary:</h3>
   <p>
     A new study from the University of Oxford, published on September 24, 2025, indicates that any level of alcohol consumption increases the risk of dementia. The research, which involved a large cohort, challenges previous suggestions that moderate alcohol intake might have protective effects against cognitive decline. The study provides evidence suggesting a direct, dose-dependent relationship between alcohol consumption and dementia risk, meaning that the more alcohol a person consumes, the higher their risk of developing dementia. This finding is significant because it contradicts earlier beliefs and has important implications for public health guidelines regarding alcohol consumption.
