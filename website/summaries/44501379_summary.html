  <p>The article discusses how Google can now access and store WhatsApp message backups, and it provides instructions on how to disable this feature. By default, WhatsApp backups on Android are stored in Google Drive, and these backups now count towards the user's Google account storage quota. This change, which began in late 2023 and fully rolled out in the first half of 2024, means that users with large WhatsApp backups might quickly exhaust their free Google Drive storage (15GB) and need to purchase additional storage. Previously, WhatsApp backups were exempt from the Google Drive storage limit.</p>

  <p>The article emphasizes the importance of managing WhatsApp backups to avoid storage issues. It explains that WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted, however, once backed up to Google Drive, this encryption is no longer applied, and Google can potentially access the backed-up data. Although Google states they encrypt data at rest, some users might still be uncomfortable with their WhatsApp data being stored on Google's servers. The guide focuses on preventing WhatsApp from backing up to Google Drive, thereby keeping message data solely on the user's device and any local backups they choose to create.</p>

  <p>The article details two primary methods for stopping Google from accessing WhatsApp messages. The first and recommended method is to disable Google Drive backups within WhatsApp settings. This involves navigating to WhatsApp settings, selecting 'Chats,' then 'Chat backup,' and finally choosing 'Back up to Google Drive.' Here, users should select 'Never' to prevent future backups to Google Drive. The article also advises manually deleting any existing WhatsApp backups from Google Drive to ensure no data remains stored there. This is done by going to Google Drive settings, selecting 'Storage,' and then deleting the WhatsApp backup file.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, the article mentions that users can switch to a different messaging app that offers more control over backups or doesn't rely on Google Drive for backups. However, the main focus remains on managing and disabling Google Drive backups within WhatsApp itself to protect user privacy and manage Google Drive storage effectively.</p>
