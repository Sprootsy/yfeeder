<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
The California Court of Appeal has ruled that holding a cell phone while driving, even for navigation purposes, is illegal under existing state law. The case stemmed from a driver who was pulled over for holding his phone to use a navigation app. He argued that he wasn't making calls or texting, which he claimed were the activities prohibited by the law.

The court disagreed, stating that the law prohibits holding and operating a wireless communication device for any reason while driving, unless the device is mounted. The court emphasized that the intent of the law is to prevent distracted driving and promote safety on the roads. The ruling clarifies that using a phone for GPS navigation while holding it in your hand is a violation of the law, regardless of whether you are making a call or sending a text message. This decision reinforces the importance of using hands-free devices or mounting phones securely when using them for navigation while driving in California.
