<h2>Summary</h2>
The article is a set of lecture notes for the course FA-5090, titled "Seminar on Selected Topics in Formal Semantics", held at Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE) in the fall of 2023. The course focuses on compositional semantics, specifically exploring extensions of Montague Grammar. The notes cover several key areas within this framework.

The first part introduces the basics of compositional semantics, building upon predicate logic and lambda calculus to represent the meanings of natural language expressions. It discusses how to assign semantic values to words and phrases and how these values combine according to syntactic structure to derive the meaning of sentences. The core principles of compositionality are explained, emphasizing the relationship between syntax and semantics.

The notes then delve into specific topics and extensions of Montague Grammar. Generalized Quantifiers are discussed, exploring how quantifiers like "every," "some," "no," and "most" can be treated uniformly within the semantic framework, moving beyond the limitations of first-order logic. This involves defining quantifiers as relations between sets.

Plurality is another major theme, examining how to represent and interpret plural noun phrases and their interactions with verbs and quantifiers. This includes discussions of different interpretations of plural sentences (distributive, collective, cumulative readings) and various approaches to handling these interpretations within a formal semantic system.

Furthermore, the article touches upon intensionality, focusing on how to handle contexts where substitution of co-referential terms does not preserve truth value, such as belief contexts. The notes likely cover modal logic and possible-worlds semantics as tools for analyzing intensional phenomena.

Finally, the notes explore event semantics. This approach analyzes verbs and verb phrases as denoting events or situations, allowing for a more fine-grained representation of meaning. Event semantics provides a framework for handling phenomena such as thematic roles (agent, patient, etc.) and adverbial modification.

In essence, the lecture notes provide a comprehensive overview of key concepts and techniques in formal semantics, with a particular emphasis on extending Montague Grammar to handle phenomena such as generalized quantification, plurality, intensionality, and event semantics. The course likely aims to equip students with the tools and knowledge necessary to analyze and model the meaning of natural language in a rigorous and systematic way.
