<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The Swift Erlang Actor System project aims to integrate Erlang's actor model and fault tolerance capabilities into Swift. The project introduces a new actor system implementation in Swift that is inspired by Erlang's lightweight processes and message-passing concurrency model. The primary goal is to provide a robust and scalable concurrency solution for Swift developers, particularly for building distributed and fault-tolerant systems. The project leverages existing Swift concurrency features like async/await and structured concurrency, while also incorporating Erlang's supervision trees for fault management. This means that actors can be organized in hierarchies, and if one actor fails, its supervisor can restart it or take other corrective actions, ensuring the overall system's stability. The implementation will focus on seamlessly integrating with Swift's existing ecosystem and will allow developers to use familiar Swift syntax and tools while benefiting from Erlang's concurrency and fault-tolerance principles. The new actor system intends to provide features such as actor creation, message passing, supervision, and distribution. The project also aims to provide a way to run Swift code in a distributed manner, leveraging Erlang's distribution capabilities. By combining the strengths of Swift and Erlang, the project hopes to offer a powerful platform for building concurrent, distributed, and fault-tolerant applications.</p>
