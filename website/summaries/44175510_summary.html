<p>A Polish engineer, Krzysztof Kuc, has created a fully functional replica of the Atari 800 XL computer from the 1980s, miniaturized to the size of a postage stamp. This tiny Atari, named the "Mini Atari 800 XL," is not just a static model; it can run original Atari software. Kuc achieved this by using a Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller to emulate the original Atari's hardware.</p>

<p>The Mini Atari 800 XL is equipped with a full-sized USB-A port for connecting peripherals like keyboards and joysticks, a mini-HDMI port for video output, and a microSD card slot for loading games and software. It boots directly into the Atari operating system. Kuc faced numerous challenges during the project, including fitting all necessary components into such a small space and ensuring compatibility with original Atari software and peripherals.</p>

<p>The project started as a personal challenge and a tribute to Kuc's childhood memories of using the Atari 800 XL. He meticulously recreated the original computer's functionality while minimizing its physical footprint. The Mini Atari 800 XL is housed in a custom-designed case that mimics the look of the original Atari 800 XL, further enhancing its authenticity. The device is powered via the USB port and requires minimal power to operate.</p>

<p>While the Mini Atari 800 XL is primarily a hobby project, it demonstrates the capabilities of modern microcontrollers and the enduring appeal of retro computing. Kuc has made the design and software for the Mini Atari 800 XL open source, allowing others to build their own miniature Atari computers. This project has garnered attention from retro computing enthusiasts and the broader tech community, highlighting the potential for recreating classic computing experiences in modern, compact forms.</p>
