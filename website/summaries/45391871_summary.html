<p><b>Summary:</b> The article discusses the recent progress in solving long-standing problems in Euclidean geometry, particularly those related to constructions with a compass and straightedge. For centuries, mathematicians have been intrigued by the limitations of these tools, with certain constructions proven impossible. These impossibilities, however, are often dependent on the specific axioms and rules governing the construction process. New mathematical approaches are revitalizing the field, allowing mathematicians to revisit and refine these problems. One area of focus involves relaxing the traditional rules or introducing new tools, like the trisector compass which can divide angles into three equal parts, to explore what becomes constructible under these modified conditions. These extensions often lead to unexpected solutions and deeper insights into the nature of geometric constructibility. The article also highlights the ongoing debate and exploration of alternative axiom systems for geometry, where seemingly impossible constructions might become achievable. These explorations touch upon fundamental questions about the nature of mathematical truth and the flexibility of geometric systems. Ultimately, the resurgence of interest in these classical problems demonstrates that even in well-established fields, there is always room for innovation and new perspectives, leading to a richer understanding of mathematical concepts.</p>
