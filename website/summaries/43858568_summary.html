    <h2>Starting July 1, Academic Publishers Can&#39;t Paywall NIH-Funded Research</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has announced a new implementation date of January 1, 2026, for its revised Public Access Policy, originally slated for January 1, 2025. This policy aims to accelerate public access to NIH-funded research results. The delay is intended to allow for additional time to prepare and ensure a smooth transition for the research community. The revised policy expands the scope of research results that must be made publicly available. It will require that all scientific data arising from NIH-funded research be made accessible to the public, unless there are valid reasons for restriction (e.g., privacy, security). It also shortens the timeframe for making publications available to the public. The NIH believes that wider and faster access to research findings will speed up scientific discovery and improve public health. This extension is to enable the NIH and the research community to address any challenges related to the new policy.</p>
