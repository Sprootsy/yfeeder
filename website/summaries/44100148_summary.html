    This article is a tutorial by Benjamin Aster explaining how to create a Minecraft block using only CSS. It details the process of building a 3D cube resembling a Minecraft block, specifically a cobblestone block, using HTML and CSS. The tutorial emphasizes leveraging CSS properties like `transform`, `transform-style`, `perspective`, and `box-shadow` to achieve the 3D effect and the characteristic pixelated texture of Minecraft blocks.

  <p>
    The article starts by setting up the basic HTML structure, which consists of a `&lt;main&gt;` element to contain the block, a `&lt;figure&gt;` element representing the cube, and six `&lt;div&gt;` elements inside the `&lt;figure&gt;`, each representing a face of the cube.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, the CSS styling is applied. The article explains how to position and style each face of the cube using `transform: translateZ()` to move the faces along the Z-axis, effectively creating the 3D structure. The `transform: rotateY()` and `transform: rotateX()` properties are used to orient the faces correctly to form the cube.

    To achieve the pixelated Minecraft look, the tutorial utilizes multiple `box-shadow` properties, each creating a small square to simulate the individual pixels of the block. The article provides specific color values for the shadows to match the cobblestone texture. Fine-tuning of the shadow positions ensures the pixelated effect is convincing.

    The article also addresses the issue of creating consistent lighting and shading across the block's faces by using different color variations for the shadows on each face. This adds depth and realism to the 3D representation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, the article describes how to use CSS variables to easily adjust the block's properties, such as size and pixel density, making it easier to customize the block's appearance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, the tutorial showcases how to animate the block by rotating it using CSS animations, adding a dynamic element to the design. The article provides the necessary CSS code to achieve a smooth and continuous rotation effect.
