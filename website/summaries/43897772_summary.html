<p>OpenAI is creating a new organizational structure to manage the different capabilities and risks presented by increasingly powerful AI models. The company is establishing a Safety and Security Committee, led by Bret Taylor and including members such as Adam D'Angelo, Tasha McCauley, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. This committee is responsible for making recommendations to the board on critical safety and security decisions for all OpenAI projects and operations. The initial focus involves evaluating and developing safeguards for existing and upcoming projects like GPT-5. The Safety and Security Committee will also commission evaluations from internal and external experts.</p>

<p>Following the committee's formation, OpenAI will publicly share an updated preparedness framework, detailing the safety and security protocols for tracking, evaluating, forecasting, and protecting against significant risks. The company acknowledges the need for continuous adaptation of its safety measures as AI technology advances.</p>

<p>This move follows the departure of several members from the previous "superalignment" team, which was focused on long-term AI safety. OpenAI emphasizes its commitment to safe AI development and deployment by creating this new committee, which will directly advise the board. The company believes this new structure will enhance its ability to navigate the complexities of advanced AI and ensure its responsible development.</p>
