<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>TUXEDO Computers has announced the discontinuation of their planned ARM notebooks featuring the Snapdragon X Elite SoC. The company cites significant performance deficits compared to initial Qualcomm promises and unsatisfactory support for Linux as the primary reasons for this decision. TUXEDO had invested considerable resources in developing a Linux distribution tailored for these devices and working closely with Qualcomm to address compatibility issues. However, the actual performance fell short of expectations, particularly in areas like GPU performance and AI capabilities, making the product uncompetitive in the current market. Furthermore, the level of support provided by Qualcomm for Linux integration and necessary kernel adaptations proved inadequate for TUXEDO's standards. The company concluded that proceeding with the ARM notebook project would not align with their commitment to delivering high-quality, performant Linux-based systems. They are now shifting their focus back to x86-based systems and exploring future ARM-based opportunities when the technology and support ecosystem mature sufficiently.</p>
