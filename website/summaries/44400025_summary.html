<p>This webpage is an interactive OCaml tutorial. It presents a series of exercises designed to help users learn the OCaml programming language. The tutorial covers a range of topics, from basic syntax and data types to more advanced concepts like recursion, pattern matching, and data structures. Each exercise includes a problem description, a code editor where users can write and test their solutions, and an evaluation mechanism that provides feedback on the correctness of the code.</p>

<p>The exercises are structured to guide learners through the fundamentals of OCaml programming. Early exercises focus on introducing basic concepts such as data types (integers, floats, booleans, strings), operators, and simple expressions. Subsequent exercises build upon these foundations, exploring topics like functions, conditional statements, and loops. The tutorial also covers more advanced data structures like lists, tuples, and records, along with techniques for manipulating them.</p>

<p>The interactive environment allows users to write and execute OCaml code directly in their web browser. The code editor provides syntax highlighting and other features to aid in writing correct code. After submitting a solution, the system evaluates it against a set of test cases and provides feedback to the user. This feedback can help users identify and correct errors in their code. The tutorial also covers recursion, a fundamental concept in functional programming, and demonstrates how to write recursive functions to solve various problems.</p>

<p>The tutorial also delves into pattern matching, a powerful feature of OCaml that allows for concise and expressive code when working with complex data structures. Pattern matching is used extensively throughout the tutorial to illustrate how to deconstruct data and handle different cases in a clear and efficient manner. Additionally, the tutorial touches upon data structures such as lists and trees, showing how to define and manipulate these structures using OCaml's type system and functional programming paradigms.</p>
