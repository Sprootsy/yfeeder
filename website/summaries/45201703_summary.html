  <p>Haystack is an open-source framework that enables developers to build production-ready applications that leverage the power of large language models (LLMs). It simplifies the process of working with LLMs and other components of the AI stack, allowing users to create search, question answering, summarization, and agentic applications. Haystack provides modular building blocks that can be combined to create custom pipelines. It handles the complexities of data management, model integration, and prompt engineering.</p>

  <p>Haystack supports various LLMs, including open-source models, cloud-based services like OpenAI's GPT models, and enterprise LLMs. It offers tools for prompt management, including prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and prompt caching. This allows developers to optimize LLM performance and reduce costs.</p>

  <p>Haystack facilitates data ingestion and indexing from various sources. It provides a unified query interface to search across different data types. Haystack also includes components for evaluating and monitoring pipeline performance, which allows developers to iterate on and improve their applications.</p>

  <p>Haystack's key features include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>LLM Orchestration:</b> Simplifying the integration and management of LLMs in applications.</li>
    <li><b>Modular Pipelines:</b> Enabling the creation of custom pipelines using reusable components.</li>
    <li><b>Prompt Management:</b> Offering tools for prompt engineering, RAG, and prompt caching.</li>
    <li><b>Data Management:</b> Providing data ingestion, indexing, and a unified query interface.</li>
    <li><b>Evaluation and Monitoring:</b> Facilitating the evaluation and monitoring of pipeline performance.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Haystack is designed to be flexible and extensible. It supports a wide range of use cases and can be adapted to specific needs. It provides a Python API and a REST API for integration into different environments. The framework is actively maintained and supported by a community of developers.</p>

  <p>Haystack is used for question answering, semantic search, document summarization, conversational AI, and other applications that require LLMs. It is used by companies of all sizes to build AI-powered applications.</p>
