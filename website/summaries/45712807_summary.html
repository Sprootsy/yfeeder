   <h2>Summary</h2>
   <p>The article showcases a collection of bizarre and often unintentionally hilarious movie posters from Africa, specifically Ghana. These posters, typically hand-painted, are known for their highly exaggerated, and often inaccurate, depictions of scenes and characters from popular Western films. The posters frequently feature hyper-violent imagery, grotesque monsters, and bizarre artistic choices that deviate significantly from the original movie's content. They were created to attract viewers to mobile cinemas that would tour throughout Ghana, showing films that were often bootlegged. Because the artists often hadn't seen the movies themselves, they relied on loose descriptions of the plot to come up with their poster designs.</p>
   <p>The article highlights the unique artistic style and cultural context that gave rise to these posters. The artists, operating with limited resources and often lacking familiarity with the films they were promoting, created posters that are more reflections of their own imaginations and the perceived tastes of their audience than faithful representations of the movies themselves. This resulted in artworks that are both visually striking and humorously misleading, transforming films into something entirely new. The posters frequently emphasize action and horror elements, often featuring monstrous creatures and intense violence, even when the original film was of a different genre. The vibrant colors, exaggerated character designs, and dynamic compositions of these posters have made them collectible items and a subject of fascination for those interested in outsider art and film history.</p>
   <p>The article emphasizes the posters' 'so bad they're good' quality. Their charm lies in their naivete, boldness, and the sheer absurdity of their interpretations. These posters offer a glimpse into a unique cultural phenomenon where the marketing of films became an art form in its own right, shaped by the creativity and resourcefulness of local artists. They stand as a testament to the power of artistic interpretation and the surprising ways in which global culture can be localized and transformed.</p>
