  <p>The article discusses the creation of the world's first AI-generated font using a combination of a custom dataset of letterforms and a fine-tuned generative AI model. The project, led by designer Peter Bushnell, sought to explore the possibilities of AI in typography while also addressing the challenges of creating a usable and aesthetically pleasing font. The process involved several stages, including gathering and curating a dataset of existing fonts, training the AI model (based on Stable Diffusion) on this dataset, and then using the trained model to generate new letterforms. The team faced issues such as the AI's tendency to produce nonsensical or illegible shapes, and the need to refine the model's training to encourage coherent and consistent letterforms. This was achieved by adjusting parameters, refining the dataset, and implementing a pipeline of manual correction and editing. The font produced, named 'Nano Banana', is described as a monospaced, uppercase font with a distinctive and slightly quirky character, reflecting the AI's unique creative process. The project highlights the potential of AI as a tool for typographic experimentation and explores the intersection of human creativity and artificial intelligence in design.</p>
