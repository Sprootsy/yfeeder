  <p>This is the first part of a series of blog posts by Jan Wildeboer about his journey into understanding and managing his own DNS infrastructure. He describes his motivation for self-hosting DNS, which stems from a desire for greater control, privacy, and the ability to experiment with advanced DNS features. He outlines the problems with relying on default ISP-provided DNS servers, particularly regarding privacy concerns due to potential logging and data collection. He details his initial, naive approach, setting up a basic BIND9 server and quickly encountering the complexities of DNS management. The post covers his challenges in configuring DNS records, understanding zone files, and dealing with the operational aspects of running a DNS server. He realized that a single server was not sufficient for redundancy, and thus further improvements were required. He also touches upon the desire to avoid being dependent on large corporations like Google for core infrastructure services. Overall, the post presents a candid account of the author's early experiences, the difficulties encountered, and the motivation to delve deeper into the world of DNS.</p>
