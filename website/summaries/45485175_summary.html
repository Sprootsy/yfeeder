    <h2>The death of industrial design and the era of dull electronics</h2>
    <div>

<p>The article discusses a perceived decline in the aesthetic appeal and innovation of industrial design in consumer electronics. The author laments the homogenization of product design, particularly noting the prevalence of rounded rectangles, smooth surfaces, and a lack of distinguishing features across various devices. They argue that a focus on minimizing production costs and maximizing manufacturing efficiency has led to a standardization of designs that prioritize functionality over visual distinctiveness and user experience.</p>

<p>The piece suggests that the pursuit of thinness, lightness, and seamless construction has resulted in devices that are increasingly difficult to repair, upgrade, or modify. This trend is attributed to the influence of large corporations and their emphasis on proprietary designs and planned obsolescence. The author criticizes the lack of tactile elements, such as buttons and switches, which have been replaced by touchscreens and minimalist interfaces. This shift, they argue, has diminished the user's sense of control and connection with the device.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the article touches on the role of software in shaping the user experience. With the increasing reliance on software-driven functionality, the physical design of the device becomes less critical. The author contends that this has led to a neglect of the sensory aspects of design, such as texture, weight, and sound. The article also points out the irony that while technology has advanced significantly, the design of consumer electronics has become increasingly bland and uninspired. The author contrasts this with earlier eras when industrial design was considered a vital aspect of product development, with designers striving to create objects that were both functional and aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<p>The author does express some hope, noting that there are still independent designers and smaller companies that are pushing the boundaries of industrial design. They emphasize the importance of supporting these efforts and encouraging a more diverse and innovative design landscape. The article concludes by calling for a renewed focus on user-centered design that prioritizes repairability, sustainability, and aesthetic appeal. The author also suggest a rediscovering the value of tactile interfaces and physical controls, arguing that these elements can enhance the user experience and create a stronger connection with the device.</p>
