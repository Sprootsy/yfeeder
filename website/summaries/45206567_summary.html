    <h2>Court rejects Verizon claim that selling location data without consent is legal</h2>

<p>The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected Verizon's argument that it was legal to sell customer location data without explicit consent. This stems from a lawsuit filed after reports revealed that Verizon, along with other carriers, was selling location data to third-party aggregators who then resold it to various entities, including bounty hunters and others who could potentially misuse the information. Verizon contended that because it anonymized the data and the third-party aggregators contractually agreed to obtain consent before reselling, it had satisfied legal requirements. However, the court disagreed.</p>

<p>The court found that Verizon's actions violated the Communications Act, which protects the confidentiality of customer information. It emphasized that Verizon directly disclosed the location data to third parties without customers' express consent. The court dismissed Verizon's arguments about anonymization and contractual obligations, stating that these measures did not absolve Verizon of its responsibility to protect customer data under the Communications Act.</p>

<p>The case originated from investigative reporting that exposed how mobile carriers were selling location data, raising significant privacy concerns. Law enforcement and other entities were able to obtain precise location information through this practice, often without proper legal oversight. The court's decision reinforces the importance of obtaining explicit consent before sharing sensitive customer data, particularly location information.</p>

<p>This ruling has broader implications for the telecommunications industry, as it clarifies the legal obligations of carriers regarding the sale and sharing of customer location data. It sets a precedent that anonymization and contractual agreements alone are insufficient to protect customer privacy when sensitive data is being disclosed to third parties. The court's decision underscores the need for telecommunications companies to implement robust safeguards and obtain explicit consent from customers before sharing location data.</p>
