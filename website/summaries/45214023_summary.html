  <p>This article announces that Let's Encrypt is partnering with the Nginx team at F5 to develop native ACME support directly within Nginx. This means that users will be able to obtain and renew Let's Encrypt certificates directly from Nginx without needing a separate ACME client like Certbot.</p>

  <p>Currently, users typically rely on external ACME clients such as Certbot to handle the process of obtaining and renewing certificates. These clients automate the steps required to prove control over a domain and request certificates from Let's Encrypt. While these tools are effective, they add complexity to the overall process and require separate installation, configuration, and maintenance.</p>

  <p>The integration of native ACME support into Nginx aims to simplify the certificate management process significantly. By building ACME functionality directly into the web server, users will be able to configure certificate issuance and renewal directly within their Nginx configuration files. This will remove the need for external scripts and tools, streamlining the process and making it easier to manage certificates.</p>

  <p>The initial phase of the project will focus on implementing the core ACME functionality within Nginx. This includes the ability to create and manage ACME accounts, request certificates, and automatically renew them when they are nearing expiration. The Nginx team and Let's Encrypt will work together to ensure that the implementation is secure, reliable, and easy to use.</p>

  <p>The article also highlights the benefits of this integration for Nginx users. By simplifying certificate management, native ACME support will make it easier for website owners to secure their sites with HTTPS. This will improve the overall security of the web and help to protect users from eavesdropping and other attacks. Furthermore, it will reduce the operational overhead associated with managing certificates, freeing up time for website owners to focus on other tasks.</p>

  <p>Let's Encrypt encourages community feedback and contributions to the project. They are actively seeking input from Nginx users and developers to ensure that the native ACME implementation meets their needs. The project is being developed in an open and transparent manner, with regular updates and opportunities for community involvement.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, the development of native ACME support for Nginx is a significant step towards simplifying certificate management and improving the security of the web. By integrating ACME functionality directly into Nginx, Let's Encrypt and the Nginx team are making it easier for website owners to secure their sites with HTTPS and reduce the operational overhead associated with managing certificates.</p>
