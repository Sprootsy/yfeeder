<p>Apple has announced significant changes to the App Store for users in the European Union to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). These changes, coming in the fall, will offer greater flexibility for developers and more choices for users. The key updates include the ability to download apps directly from developers’ websites (bypassing the App Store), new tools and APIs for developers, and reduced fees.</p>

<p>One of the most notable changes is the introduction of web distribution. Developers can now distribute their iOS apps directly from their own websites, allowing them to bypass Apple's App Store commission fees and App Store review process. This feature aims to give developers more control over how they reach their users and monetize their apps. Apple will still implement certain safeguards, such as requiring developers to meet specific criteria and adhere to notarization requirements to ensure user safety and platform integrity.</p>

<p>In addition to web distribution, Apple is also introducing alternative app marketplaces. Developers can create and run their own app stores, offering users a curated selection of apps outside of the official App Store. This change opens up new opportunities for niche app ecosystems and specialized app collections. Apple will oversee these alternative app stores, ensuring they meet specific standards for user safety and security.</p>

<p>Apple is also updating its fee structure for developers in the EU. The new fee structure includes reduced commissions for apps distributed through the App Store. Developers can choose between two options: a reduced commission of 17% (or 10% for small businesses and subscriptions after the first year) or a commission of 0% for apps distributed exclusively through web distribution or alternative app marketplaces. However, even with 0% commission, a Core Technology Fee (CTF) of €0.50 per first annual install will apply for apps exceeding one million installs in a 12-month period. This fee is designed to support Apple's ongoing investments in its platform.</p>

<p>To facilitate these changes, Apple is providing developers with new APIs and tools. These resources will help developers integrate with alternative app marketplaces, support web distribution, and manage user entitlements. The new APIs also enable developers to offer alternative payment options within their apps, complying with the DMA's requirement for fair access to payment systems.</p>

<p>Apple is introducing notarization requirements for all iOS apps, regardless of their distribution method. Notarization involves a baseline review process that ensures apps meet basic security and privacy standards. This process aims to protect users from malware, fraud, and other security threats. Apps distributed through the App Store, web distribution, or alternative app marketplaces will all need to be notarized.</p>

<p>These changes are specific to the 27 countries in the European Union to comply with the Digital Markets Act. The DMA aims to promote competition and fairness in the digital market by preventing large tech companies from abusing their market power. Apple's adjustments to the App Store are intended to meet these requirements while maintaining a secure and user-friendly experience.</p>
