  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The article on Big Think explores the theoretical possibility of constructing a continuous railway line stretching from Sagres, Portugal, to Singapore. This ambitious project, dubbed the "Greater Eurasian Railway," highlights the interconnectedness of the Eurasian landmass and the potential for enhanced trade, travel, and cultural exchange through rail transport. The article delves into the geographical and political challenges associated with such an undertaking, including varying railway gauges, border crossings, and geopolitical considerations. It also touches upon existing rail networks, like the Trans-Siberian Railway and China's expanding high-speed rail infrastructure, which could form crucial segments of the envisioned Portugal-to-Singapore route. While acknowledging the significant hurdles and the project's largely conceptual nature, the piece underscores the symbolic importance of connecting Europe and Asia by rail, fostering greater understanding and cooperation between the two continents.</p>

  <p>The article maps out a potential route, detailing the countries it would traverse, including Spain, France, Germany, Poland, Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan, China, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and finally Singapore. It acknowledges that there are already existing rail lines that can be used to build this railway line, and where connections will need to be built. However, the article does mention some challenges that this project would face, such as the different rail gauges used in Spain and Portugal, which are wider than the European standard. It also states that there would be issues with border crossing, as countries have different regulations, and that China and Russia would be crucial to the project due to their size and influence.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, the article suggests that despite the practical difficulties, the idea of a Portugal-to-Singapore railway represents a compelling vision of global interconnectedness and the potential for overcoming geographical and political barriers through infrastructure development. While this project is not likely to be built anytime soon, it does allow for an interesting thought experiment on the world becoming closer.</p>
