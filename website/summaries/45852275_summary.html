    <h2>FAA to restrict commercial rocket launches to overnight hours</h2>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has indefinitely restricted commercial rocket launches due to safety concerns arising from the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. The shutdown has impacted the FAA's ability to ensure public safety during launches, specifically concerning air traffic management. Without government employees available to monitor air space, commercial launches are being put on hold until the government shutdown ends. This halt affects commercial space companies that rely on FAA licenses to conduct launches. The FAA is responsible for protecting the public during commercial launches, including issuing airspace restrictions to keep civilian aircraft away from launch trajectories. With the shutdown, the FAA lacks the personnel necessary to perform these critical safety functions, leading to the launch restrictions. </p>
