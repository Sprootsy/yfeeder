  <p>This article discusses the concept of an "Agent Loop" in the context of AI and programming. It explains how to create a basic agent loop, focusing on its core components and how they interact. The agent loop is defined as a system that observes its environment, plans a course of action, acts on that plan, and then repeats the process. This cycle allows the agent to learn and adapt over time.</p>

  <p>The article breaks down the agent loop into three main parts: Observation, Planning, and Action. </p>

  <p><b>Observation</b> involves gathering information from the environment. This could be data from sensors, user input, or other sources. The agent needs to be able to interpret this information to understand the current state of the world.</p>

  <p><b>Planning</b> is the process of deciding what to do next. This typically involves using a model or algorithm to generate a sequence of actions that will help the agent achieve its goals. The plan should be based on the observations made in the previous step.</p>

  <p><b>Action</b> involves executing the plan. This could mean sending commands to actuators, displaying information to the user, or taking any other action that affects the environment. The consequences of the action are then observed in the next iteration of the loop.</p>

  <p>The article uses examples to illustrate how an agent loop can be implemented in practice. It talks about using GPT models and other AI tools to perform these tasks. The author emphasizes the importance of having a clear objective for the agent, as this will guide the planning process. They also mention the challenges of creating robust and reliable agent loops, such as dealing with uncertainty, errors, and unexpected events.</p>

  <p>The agent loop offers a powerful paradigm for creating autonomous systems that can solve complex problems. As AI technology continues to advance, agent loops are likely to become increasingly important in a wide range of applications.</p>

  <h2>Key Points:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>An agent loop is a cyclical process of observation, planning, and action.</li>
    <li>The observation phase gathers information from the environment.</li>
    <li>The planning phase decides on a course of action based on observations.</li>
    <li>The action phase executes the plan, affecting the environment.</li>
    <li>Agent loops enable AI systems to learn and adapt over time.</li>
