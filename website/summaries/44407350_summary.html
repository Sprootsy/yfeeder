<p>This article from AFP Fact Check addresses a claim circulating online that purports to show Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with a Nazi symbol. The fact check asserts that this claim is false and that the image has been digitally altered.</p>

<p>The article details how social media posts shared an image of Zelenskyy wearing a black T-shirt featuring a symbol resembling a black sun or Sonnenrad, a symbol that has been appropriated by neo-Nazis and some far-right groups. The posts implied that Zelenskyy's attire indicated his support for or affiliation with Nazi ideology.</p>

<p>AFP Fact Check investigated the claim by conducting a reverse image search and comparing the altered image with original photographs and videos of Zelenskyy. They found that the original images show Zelenskyy wearing a plain black T-shirt, or a T-shirt with other symbols such as the Ukrainian trident (the coat of arms of Ukraine) or other patriotic emblems. There was no evidence in the original sources to support the claim that he wore a T-shirt with the controversial Sonnenrad symbol.</p>

<p>The fact check provides examples of the original images and videos where Zelenskyy is seen wearing different T-shirts, none of which feature the alleged Nazi symbol. By comparing these authentic sources with the manipulated image, AFP Fact Check was able to demonstrate that the image was digitally altered to include the offensive symbol.</p>

<p>AFP concludes that the claim is false, stating that the image of Zelenskyy wearing a T-shirt with a Nazi symbol is a fabrication intended to spread disinformation and tarnish his reputation and that of Ukraine, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict with Russia, where Russian propaganda has frequently attempted to associate Ukraine with Nazism.</p>
