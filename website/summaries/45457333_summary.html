<p>Apple removed the ICE Watch app from its app store after pressure from Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. The app allowed users to report sightings of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and track their activities. Bondi argued that the app could potentially endanger law enforcement officers. The app's creator, identified only as &quot;Jose,&quot; stated that the intention of the app was to alert communities to ICE activity, not to incite violence. Apple's decision to remove the app followed Bondi's concerns about potential safety risks. The app had been available for several weeks before its removal.</p>
