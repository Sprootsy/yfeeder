    This article discusses the challenge of discovering interesting and valuable content in a world where algorithms increasingly dominate curation and recommendation. The author reflects on the shift from human-curated content to algorithm-driven feeds, highlighting the drawbacks of the latter, such as the amplification of sensationalism and the creation of filter bubbles.
  </p>
  <p>
    The author begins by noting the prevalence of algorithmic curation in modern online platforms, where personalized feeds are designed to maximize engagement rather than to surface high-quality or diverse content. This leads to a situation where individuals are primarily exposed to information that confirms their existing biases, limiting their perspectives and understanding of the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article contrasts this algorithmic approach with the earlier model of human curation, where editors, critics, and other experts played a crucial role in filtering and recommending content based on quality, relevance, and originality. While human curation was not without its own biases and limitations, it generally prioritized content that met certain standards of excellence and offered a broader range of perspectives.
  </p>

    The author suggests that the decline of human curation has contributed to a sense of overwhelming noise and information overload, making it increasingly difficult to find truly valuable content. In response, the author proposes several strategies for navigating this landscape and rediscovering the benefits of curation.
  </p>
  <p>
    One key suggestion is to actively seek out human curators and sources that align with one's values and interests. This might involve subscribing to newsletters, following independent bloggers, or participating in online communities that prioritize thoughtful discussion and high-quality content. The author emphasizes the importance of diversifying one's sources of information to avoid echo chambers and gain a more comprehensive understanding of different perspectives.

    The author also advocates for a more mindful and intentional approach to consuming online content. This involves being selective about the platforms and feeds one engages with, and consciously seeking out content that challenges one's assumptions and expands one's knowledge. It also means being critical of algorithmic recommendations and actively seeking out alternative sources of information.

    Furthermore, the article highlights the importance of supporting independent creators and platforms that prioritize quality over engagement. This could involve subscribing to independent publications, donating to creators whose work you appreciate, or participating in online communities that are not driven by algorithms.
  </p>
  <p>
    In essence, the author argues that rediscovering curation in an age of algorithms requires a proactive and intentional approach. By actively seeking out human curators, diversifying one's sources of information, and supporting independent creators, individuals can reclaim control over their information diet and cultivate a more enriching and meaningful online experience. The article also points out that individuals should also take responsibility for their own feeds and content consumption instead of blindly trusting an algorithm.
