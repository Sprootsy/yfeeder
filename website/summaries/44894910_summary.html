<p>Palantir Technologies, founded in 2003 by Peter Thiel and others, is a controversial data analytics company known for its work with government agencies and large corporations. The company builds software platforms that help organizations integrate, manage, secure, and analyze large and complex datasets. Palantir's core platforms are Gotham and Foundry.</p>

<p>Gotham is designed for government and law enforcement agencies. It allows users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, predict future events, and ultimately make better decisions. Gotham's capabilities have been used in counterterrorism, law enforcement, and military operations. The software can integrate various data sources, including signals intelligence, human intelligence, and financial records, to create a comprehensive operational picture. This has made it valuable to agencies like the CIA, FBI, and Department of Defense.</p>

<p>Foundry is Palantir's platform for commercial clients. It aims to transform how organizations operate by creating a central operating system for their data. Foundry allows users to integrate data from disparate sources, analyze it, and then operationalize those insights into real-world actions. Industries such as aerospace, energy, healthcare, and manufacturing use Foundry to optimize supply chains, improve product development, and manage complex operations. The platform emphasizes collaboration and allows different teams within an organization to work together on a shared data foundation.</p>

<p>Palantir has faced considerable controversy due to the nature of its work and its close ties with government agencies. Critics raise concerns about privacy, civil liberties, and the potential for misuse of its technology. The company's involvement in surveillance and data collection practices has drawn scrutiny from privacy advocates and human rights organizations. Palantir defends its work by emphasizing that its software is used to solve critical problems and that it adheres to strict ethical guidelines and legal regulations. The company argues that its technologies are essential for national security and for helping businesses operate more efficiently and effectively.</p>

<p>Palantir's business model involves working closely with its clients to customize and deploy its platforms. This often requires a significant investment of time and resources, as the company's engineers work on-site with clients to understand their specific needs and challenges. Palantir's revenue model includes subscription fees and professional services, reflecting the ongoing support and customization required to maintain and evolve its platforms.</p>

<p>The company's long-term vision involves becoming the operating system for all major institutions, both public and private.
