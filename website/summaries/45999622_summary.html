According to experts, Prozac is no better than a placebo for treating depression in children. An analysis of existing clinical trial data, including unpublished studies, reveals that the widely prescribed antidepressant fluoxetine (Prozac) offers little benefit over placebo for young people experiencing depression. While some individual studies have indicated that Prozac can be effective, a comprehensive review suggests these findings are not robust when all available data are considered.

The research highlights the complexity of treating depression in children and adolescents, where factors such as therapy, family support, and environmental influences play crucial roles. The use of antidepressants in young people has been a topic of considerable debate, with concerns raised about potential side effects, including an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

The findings emphasize the need for a more holistic approach to addressing depression in children, prioritizing non-pharmacological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and family therapy. Experts also stress the importance of careful monitoring of young people taking antidepressants and advocate for more research to develop effective and safe treatments for childhood depression. The article notes that while medication may have a role in some cases, it should not be considered a first-line treatment and should be used in conjunction with other forms of support and therapy.
