<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The article details how the author was able to find the passport number of former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott through publicly available information on Instagram. The article explains that in 2014, Abbott's sister, Christine Forster, posted a photo on Instagram of Tony Abbott's Qantas boarding pass. While the image was low resolution, the author was able to use image enhancement techniques and publicly available information, specifically details related to his flight itinerary, to identify the flight number and date, and subsequently was able to guess what the passport number could have been. By combining information from the boarding pass with educated guesses based on the standard Australian passport format, the author was able to get very close to the actual number. The author emphasizes that they did not engage in any illegal activities such as hacking or unauthorized access to databases, but instead relied solely on publicly available information to piece together the passport number. The article serves as a case study demonstrating the potential risks of sharing seemingly innocuous information online, particularly when it comes to sensitive personal data. It highlights how seemingly harmless social media posts can be exploited to reveal private information and underscores the importance of being mindful of the information shared online, even by individuals with a public profile.</p>
