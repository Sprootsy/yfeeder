<p>According to a report on ProtonDB, nearly 90% of Windows games are now playable on Linux. This is a significant increase, making gaming on Linux a more viable option, especially as Windows 10 nears its end-of-life. The data is gathered from ProtonDB, a community-driven website that collects reports from Linux users about their experiences running Windows games through Proton, a compatibility layer developed by Valve for Steam. Proton allows Linux users to play games that are designed for Windows without requiring dual-booting or virtual machines.</p>

<p>The report highlights the progress made in compatibility, with many popular and demanding titles now running smoothly on Linux. This improvement is attributed to ongoing development and updates to Proton, as well as advancements in Linux drivers and hardware support. The increasing viability of Linux for gaming is particularly relevant given Microsoft's end of support for Windows 10, which may encourage more users to explore Linux as an alternative operating system for gaming.</p>

<p>ProtonDB categorizes games into different compatibility levels based on user reports: "Platinum" (runs perfectly out of the box), "Gold" (runs perfectly after minor tweaks), "Silver" (runs with minor issues), "Bronze" (runs, but with major issues), and "Borked" (does not run at all). The high percentage of playable games indicates that a large portion of titles fall into the Platinum, Gold, and Silver categories.</p>

<p>The article emphasizes that while not every game is perfectly compatible, the overall trend is positive, with more games becoming playable on Linux over time. This makes Linux a more attractive option for gamers looking for an alternative to Windows, especially those who value open-source software and greater control over their operating system.</p>
