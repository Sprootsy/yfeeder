These organizations play a crucial role in developing the profession of valuers. The article emphasizes the importance of adhering to the Model Bye-Laws to maintain standards and ethics within the valuation profession.</p>

<p>The Model Bye-Laws are designed to guide RVOs in their operations and governance. They cover various aspects, including membership criteria, rights and obligations of members, the establishment of committees, disciplinary procedures, grievance redressal mechanisms, and the overall management of the RVO. They prescribe eligibility criteria for individuals seeking membership, such as educational qualifications, experience requirements, and the passing of valuation examinations conducted by IBBI. The bye-laws also specify the process for admission, renewal, and termination of membership.</p>

<p>The article highlights the responsibilities of RVO members, which include upholding the code of conduct, adhering to valuation standards, participating in continuing professional education, and cooperating with the RVO in its regulatory functions.

These committees may include membership committees, disciplinary committees, and ethics committees. The bye-laws outline the procedures for conducting meetings, making decisions, and maintaining records.</p>

<p>A significant portion of the Model Bye-Laws is dedicated to disciplinary proceedings. They describe the process for handling complaints against members, conducting investigations, and imposing penalties for misconduct. The bye-laws ensure that disciplinary actions are fair, transparent, and consistent with the principles of natural justice. Members have the right to appeal against disciplinary decisions.</p>
