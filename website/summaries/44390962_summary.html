<h2>Summary: Kea DHCP Software 3.0 Release</h2>

<p>The article announces the release of Kea DHCP software version 3.0, marking a significant advancement in the open-source DHCP server developed by Internet Systems Consortium (ISC). This release introduces several new features, improvements, and bug fixes, making it a more robust and feature-rich solution for network administrators managing IP address assignment and related network configuration.</p>

<p>A key highlight of Kea 3.0 is the introduction of support for DHCP over TLS (DoT). This feature enhances the security of DHCP communications by encrypting the exchanges between the DHCP server and clients, thereby protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. DoT support strengthens the overall security posture of networks relying on DHCP for address assignment.</p>

<p>Another notable enhancement is the introduction of a REST API, allowing for programmatic control and monitoring of the Kea DHCP server. This API enables administrators to automate tasks, integrate Kea with other network management systems, and gain real-time insights into the server's operation. The REST API significantly improves the manageability and flexibility of Kea deployments.</p>

<p>Kea 3.0 also includes improvements to IPv6 prefix delegation. These improvements provide more options for prefix selection and assignment. Additionally, Kea now supports a new subnet type that allows administrators to associate fixed addresses with delegated prefixes. This provides more control and flexibility in IPv6 network management.</p>

<p>The release focuses on enhancing performance and scalability. Various optimizations have been implemented to improve the server's ability to handle a large number of DHCP requests efficiently. This makes Kea 3.0 suitable for deployment in environments with demanding performance requirements.</p>

<p>Kea 3.0 incorporates numerous bug fixes addressing issues reported in previous versions. These fixes improve the overall stability and reliability of the software. Details of the specific bug fixes are available in the release notes.</p>

<p>The article emphasizes the importance of consulting the Kea Administrator Reference Manual for detailed information on the new features, configuration options, and usage guidelines. The manual provides comprehensive documentation to help administrators effectively deploy and manage Kea 3.0.</p>

<p>In summary, Kea 3.0 represents a significant upgrade to the Kea DHCP software, offering enhanced security, improved manageability, better performance, and increased stability. These enhancements make Kea an attractive option for organizations seeking a modern, open-source DHCP server solution.</p>
