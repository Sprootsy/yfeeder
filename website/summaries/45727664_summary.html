    <b>Summary:</b>
    The article "Coding vs. Software Engineering" distinguishes between coding and software engineering, arguing they are related but not interchangeable. Coding, at its core, is the act of translating human-readable instructions into machine-executable code. It is focused on writing the lines of code that perform specific tasks. Coding emphasizes syntax, algorithms, and data structures to solve a defined problem efficiently. A coder excels at implementing solutions and ensuring the code functions as intended. They may work on smaller, well-defined problems or specific modules within a larger system.

    Software engineering, on the other hand, is a broader discipline that encompasses the entire lifecycle of software development. It involves not only writing code but also requirements gathering, system design, architecture, testing, deployment, maintenance, and project management. Software engineers focus on the overall structure and behavior of a system, ensuring it meets the needs of users and stakeholders. They consider factors such as scalability, security, reliability, and maintainability. Software engineering emphasizes collaboration, communication, and problem-solving skills to build complex, long-lasting software systems. Software engineers use various methodologies and tools to manage the development process, ensuring quality and efficiency. The article highlights that while a software engineer must be proficient in coding, their role extends beyond simply writing code. They are responsible for designing and building entire systems, considering the big picture and making strategic decisions.

    The article emphasizes that coding is a subset of software engineering.  Software engineering requires a deeper understanding of software development principles, design patterns, and architectural considerations. It involves more planning and thinking, not just implementing.
  </p>
  <p>
    In essence, coding is about writing individual instructions, while software engineering is about building and maintaining complex software systems. One can be a coder without being a software engineer, but a software engineer must have strong coding skills.
