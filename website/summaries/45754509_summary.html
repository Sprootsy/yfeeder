 <h3>Summary:</h3>
 <p>The article discusses concerns regarding Crunchyroll's subtitle quality and practices. It claims that Crunchyroll is replacing existing fan-created subtitles with inferior, AI-generated subtitles, leading to a decline in quality. The author provides several examples of specific instances where the new subtitles are less accurate, less nuanced, and less readable than the older fan-made versions.
 </p>
 <p>The author points out that the previous subtitles were often created by dedicated fans who possessed deep knowledge of the source material and cultural context, which allowed them to produce accurate and high-quality translations. In contrast, the AI-generated subtitles seem to lack this understanding and often miss subtle nuances, cultural references, and character subtleties. The author suggests that this change is driven by cost-cutting measures, as AI-generated subtitles are cheaper to produce than human-translated ones.

 <p>The article also highlights the negative impact this change has on the viewing experience for Crunchyroll subscribers. Viewers who rely on accurate and well-written subtitles to fully understand and appreciate the content are finding themselves increasingly frustrated with the poor quality of the new subtitles.
