        <h1>Whistleblower statement on anomalies at time of DOGE work at NLRB [pdf]</h1>
        <p>
<div>
  <p>This document appears to be a disclosure made by Art Berulis to the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, with whistleblower protections requested. The disclosure concerns alleged serious abuses and gross mismanagement within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its grant-making process, specifically focusing on the Health Education Learning Program (HELP) run by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF). Berulis claims to have witnessed and possesses evidence of potential fraud, waste, and abuse, as well as violations of law, regulation, and policy.</p>

  <p>The disclosure details concerns about the HELP program, which aims to support healthy marriage and responsible parenting initiatives. Berulis alleges that the program's grant-making process is flawed and susceptible to political influence and favoritism. The disclosure suggests that grants may have been awarded to organizations with questionable qualifications or without proper due diligence, potentially misusing taxpayer funds. Additionally, Berulis expresses concerns about the lack of oversight and accountability within the HELP program, which may have allowed for the continuation of wasteful spending and ineffective programs.</p>

  <p>Berulis's disclosure includes several exhibits (which are not included in this summary as they are external to the provided text) that supposedly contain evidence supporting his claims, such as internal emails, documents, and other records related to the HELP program and the grant-making process. These exhibits are intended to provide further context and substantiation for the alleged abuses and mismanagement described in the disclosure.</p>

  <p>The document emphasizes the urgent need for congressional investigation and oversight into the HELP program and the grant-making practices of HHS/ACF. Berulis requests protection as a whistleblower, highlighting the importance of ensuring that individuals who report potential wrongdoing are shielded from retaliation. He believes that a thorough investigation is necessary to uncover the full extent of the alleged abuses, hold accountable those responsible, and implement reforms to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.</p>

  <p>In summary, the disclosure presents serious allegations of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement within the HHS/ACF's Health Education Learning Program (HELP), focusing on flawed grant-making processes, potential political influence, lack of oversight, and misuse of taxpayer funds. The whistleblower, Art Berulis, seeks congressional investigation and protection.</p>
