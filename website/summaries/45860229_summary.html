The article explores the nature of hallucinations induced by hallucinogenic drugs, specifically focusing on the visual experiences they produce. It explains that while the common perception is that hallucinogens cause people to see entirely unreal things, a significant portion of these hallucinations are actually based on altered perceptions of existing visual structures and patterns within the brain.

The author details how the brain's visual cortex is organized into a hierarchical structure, with different areas responsible for processing edges, shapes, colors, and more complex objects. Hallucinogens disrupt this normal processing, leading to distortions and exaggerations of existing patterns. Researchers have identified specific geometric forms (form constants) that are commonly reported across different hallucinogens and cultures, suggesting a universal structure to these drug-induced visions. These form constants include lattices, tunnels, spirals, and cobwebs.

The piece references neuroscientific research that uses fMRI and other techniques to study brain activity during hallucinogenic experiences. These studies have revealed that hallucinogens like psilocybin and LSD increase activity and connectivity within the visual cortex. This heightened activity is linked to the intensity of visual hallucinations. The default mode network (DMN), which is associated with self-referential thought, also plays a role. Hallucinogens can disrupt the normal functioning of the DMN, contributing to altered perceptions of reality and ego dissolution.

Furthermore, the article dives into the potential evolutionary origins of these visual structures in the brain, drawing parallels between the geometry seen in hallucinations and fundamental patterns found in nature. It explores the idea that the brain's inherent visual architecture is predisposed to generate these patterns when normal sensory input is altered or suppressed, as is the case with hallucinogens.

The author then considers the role of context and expectation in shaping hallucinatory experiences. While the underlying neurological mechanisms may be similar, the specific content and interpretation of hallucinations can vary based on individual beliefs, cultural background, and the setting in which the drug is taken.

Finally, the article touches on the therapeutic potential of hallucinogens, particularly in treating mental health conditions. The ability of these substances to disrupt entrenched thought patterns and promote new perspectives is seen as a valuable tool in psychotherapy. The article suggests that understanding the neurobiological basis of hallucinations could lead to more effective and targeted therapies.
