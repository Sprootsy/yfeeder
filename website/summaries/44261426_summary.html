  <h2>Summary of Firebase Status Page</h2>
  <p>The Firebase Status page provides real-time information on the operational status of various Firebase services. It tracks incidents and maintenance events that may affect the performance or availability of these services. The page lists each Firebase service (e.g., Authentication, Cloud Firestore, Realtime Database, Cloud Storage, Hosting, Cloud Functions, Cloud Messaging, Performance Monitoring, Crashlytics, Remote Config, App Distribution, Dynamic Links, Extensions, Test Lab, App Check, Analytics, In-App Messaging, Predictions, A/B Testing) and displays its current status as either "Available," "Information," "Degraded Performance," or "Service Disruption." Each status indicator is accompanied by a brief description of the issue (if any), the affected services or regions, and any updates or resolutions. The history of incidents and maintenance activities are maintained for reference, offering transparency on past service interruptions. The page also includes a feature where users can subscribe to updates via email or RSS feed to receive notifications about any changes in the status of Firebase services.</p>
