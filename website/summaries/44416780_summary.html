  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Europeans are expressing anger towards Elon Musk due to various factors, including his political views,
    content moderation policies on X (formerly Twitter), and perceived support for right-wing narratives.
    This sentiment is coinciding with a drop in Tesla sales within Europe. Tesla sales have been declining in Europe this year,
    facing challenges from cheaper Chinese EVs and established European automakers introducing their own electric models. 
    Additionally, increased tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles are expected to further impact Tesla's competitive landscape in the
    European market, particularly if Tesla, which also manufactures in China, becomes subject to the tariffs.
