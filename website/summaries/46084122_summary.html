  <p>The article discusses the "tricusp triangle," a shape formed by three overlapping circles. It focuses on the geometric properties and mathematical relationships associated with this shape. The author explores how the area of the tricusp triangle relates to the area of the triangle formed by the centers of the three circles. The article details a specific formula to determine the area of the tricusp triangle based on the side length of the triangle created by connecting the centers of the circles. It also points out the area is about 4.2% of the triangle formed by the centers of the circles.</p>

  <h2>Key Points:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The tricusp triangle is formed by the intersection of three equal circles.</li>
    <li>The area of the tricusp triangle is related to the area of the triangle formed by connecting the centers of the three circles.</li>
    <li>The area of tricusp triangle is given by the formula \( (\pi - \sqrt{3})r^2 \), where \( r \) is the radius of the three circles and the side length of the triangle formed by their centers is \( r \sqrt{3} \).</li>
    <li>The area of the tricusp triangle is approximately 4.2% of the area of the triangle formed by the centers of the three circles.</li>
