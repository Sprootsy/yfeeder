    <h2>H1-B visas hurt one type of worker and exploit another</h2>

 <p>The article is an opinion piece written by Senator Bernie Sanders criticizing the H-1B visa program. Sanders argues that the program, while intended to address labor shortages in specialized fields, has been exploited by corporations to drive down wages for American workers and exploit foreign workers. He contends that companies often replace experienced, higher-paid American employees with H-1B visa holders who are paid less, thereby saving money at the expense of American jobs and wages.</p>
 
 <p>Sanders highlights the vulnerability of H-1B workers, who are often tied to a single employer, making them less likely to negotiate for better wages or working conditions for fear of losing their visa status and being deported. This, he argues, creates a system where these workers are susceptible to exploitation.</p>
 
 <p>The senator acknowledges that some companies genuinely use the H-1B program to fill specialized roles when qualified American workers are unavailable. However, he asserts that the program is rife with abuse and negatively impacts the American workforce. He points to cases where companies have laid off large numbers of American workers only to replace them with H-1B visa holders, often requiring the displaced American workers to train their replacements.</p>
 
 <p>Sanders calls for reforms to the H-1B visa program to protect both American and foreign workers. He proposes raising the minimum wage for H-1B visa holders to prevent companies from using the program to undercut American wages. He also advocates for stricter enforcement of regulations to prevent companies from laying off American workers and replacing them with H-1B visa holders.</p>
 
 <p>Furthermore, Sanders emphasizes the need to prioritize American workers and invest in education and training programs to ensure that American workers have the skills needed to fill high-demand jobs. He believes that by strengthening the American workforce, the need for H-1B visas will decrease, and American workers will be better positioned to compete in the global economy.</p>
 
 <p>In conclusion, Sanders argues that the H-1B visa program, as it currently operates, is detrimental to American workers and exploitative of foreign workers. He calls for comprehensive reforms to address these issues, including raising wages, strengthening enforcement, and investing in the American workforce.</p>
