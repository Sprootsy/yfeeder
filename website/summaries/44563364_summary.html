<h2>Summary:</h2>

The article is a retrospective on the Neopost/Francotyp-Postalia Mailstation, a dedicated internet appliance from the late 1990s designed primarily for email. It highlights the device's origins, features, market positioning, and ultimate failure. The Mailstation was conceived as an easy-to-use email device for individuals who were intimidated by personal computers. It aimed to bring email to a broader audience by offering a simpler and more affordable alternative to traditional PCs.

The device featured a simplified user interface, a dedicated keyboard, and a monochrome LCD screen. It connected to the internet via a built-in modem and relied on a proprietary operating system. The Mailstation was marketed as a user-friendly device that required minimal setup and technical knowledge. Neopost and Francotyp-Postalia, companies traditionally focused on postage meters, saw an opportunity to leverage their existing customer base and brand recognition to enter the emerging internet appliance market.

However, the Mailstation faced several challenges that contributed to its failure. The device's limited functionality, high price point compared to increasingly affordable PCs, and the rise of free email services accessible through web browsers all hindered its adoption. Additionally, the Mailstation's reliance on a proprietary operating system and lack of expandability limited its long-term potential. The article points out that while the Mailstation was innovative for its time, it ultimately failed to compete with the rapidly evolving PC market and the increasing availability of cheaper and more versatile computing devices. The author attributes the Mailstation's failure to several factors, including its high price, limited functionality, and the rapidly changing technology landscape of the late 1990s.
