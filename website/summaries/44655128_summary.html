    A recent earthquake in Turkey and Syria caused a significant ground slip,
    estimated at 2.5 meters, which has been captured on video for the first
    time. The footage reveals the sheer power of the seismic event and the
    devastating impact it had on the Earth's surface. The earthquake, which has
    resulted in widespread destruction and loss of life, also triggered
    observable geological changes. This ground slip is a testament to the
    earthquake's magnitude and provides valuable data for scientists studying
    seismic activity.
