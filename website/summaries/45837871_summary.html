<div>
<p>The article announces a preview release of Swift for FreeBSD. This signifies a step towards expanding Swift's platform support beyond Apple's operating systems (macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS), Linux, and Windows.</p>

<p>The Swift.org - Platform Support working group has been working on porting Swift to FreeBSD, and this preview release marks a significant milestone. While it is not yet considered fully supported or feature-complete, it allows developers to experiment with Swift on FreeBSD and provide valuable feedback.</p>

<p>The announcement outlines the current status of the port, highlighting the components that are functional and those that are still under development. A significant portion of the Swift compiler, core libraries, and related tools are now operational on FreeBSD. This enables developers to compile and run Swift code on FreeBSD systems.</p>

<p>The preview release provides a build script to facilitate the process of setting up Swift on FreeBSD. It fetches the necessary dependencies, configures the build environment, and compiles the Swift toolchain. Instructions for building from source are also provided for users who prefer a more hands-on approach.</p>

<p>The developers are actively seeking feedback from the community. They encourage users to test the preview release, report any issues encountered, and contribute to the ongoing development efforts. This feedback is crucial for identifying bugs, improving performance, and ensuring the stability of Swift on FreeBSD.</p>

<p>The announcement also mentions that certain features and functionalities may not be fully implemented in this preview release. Some areas may require further optimization or bug fixes. The goal is to gradually improve the port based on user feedback and contributions.</p>

<p>This preview release represents a significant advancement in bringing Swift to FreeBSD. By making Swift available on a wider range of platforms, it opens up new possibilities for developers to create cross-platform applications and libraries. The collaborative efforts of the Swift community are essential for achieving a fully supported and robust Swift environment on FreeBSD.</p>

<p>In summary, the announcement signals the availability of a preview release of Swift for FreeBSD, encouraging developers to test, provide feedback, and contribute to the ongoing porting efforts. This move extends Swift's reach and broadens its applicability across different operating systems.</p>
