<h3>Summary</h3>
The article "C++26 Reflections Adventures: Compile-Time UML" explores the potential of C++26's reflection capabilities to generate UML diagrams at compile time. It discusses how reflection can be used to introspect C++ code, extract information about classes, members, and relationships, and then leverage this information to create UML diagrams automatically. The author investigates the technical challenges and possibilities of implementing such a system, focusing on how reflection features can be used to query the structure of C++ code in a standardized way. The article covers several key areas, including the basics of C++ reflection, the architecture needed for a compile-time UML generator, handling different kinds of relationships, and the performance implications of reflection. The author delves into specific code examples showcasing the usage of reflection to retrieve class names, member details, and inheritance information. The discussion includes ways to represent UML elements in code and transform the reflected data into a standard UML format like XMI. The author also considers the limitations and complexities involved, such as dealing with template metaprogramming and ensuring the accuracy of the generated diagrams for complex codebases. Overall, the article presents a forward-looking exploration of how C++26's reflection features could revolutionize software development by automating the generation of UML diagrams, thus enhancing code understanding and documentation.
