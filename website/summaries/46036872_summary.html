<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The developers of Zorin OS, a Linux distribution known for its user-friendliness and focus on Windows users, have reported a significant surge in downloads following the end-of-life (EOL) of Windows 10. According to Zorin OS, over 780,000 Windows users have chosen to migrate to their Linux distribution instead of upgrading to Windows 11. This influx has contributed to Zorin OS reaching a record-breaking 1 million downloads in just five weeks. The developers attribute this increase to Windows 11's hardware requirements, which can make it difficult or impossible for some older PCs to upgrade. Zorin OS provides an alternative for users who want to continue using their existing hardware without the security risks associated with running an unsupported operating system like Windows 10 after its EOL. The developers highlight Zorin OS's focus on ease of use, making it a suitable option for those unfamiliar with Linux. The distribution is designed to resemble Windows, easing the transition for new users. They also emphasize the performance benefits of Zorin OS on older hardware, claiming it can breathe new life into aging PCs. Zorin OS offers various editions, including a free version and a paid "Pro" version with additional features and support. The reported download numbers indicate a growing interest in Linux as a viable alternative to Windows, particularly for users seeking to avoid the upgrade requirements or costs associated with the latest version of Microsoft's operating system.</p>
