<p>The article is a webpage for Fakespot, a service that analyzes product reviews to detect fake or unreliable reviews. Fakespot aims to help consumers make informed purchasing decisions by providing an adjusted rating and analysis of the reviews for a particular product. The website allows users to analyze product URLs from various e-commerce platforms. It provides a grade (A-F) indicating the reliability of the reviews, highlights potential issues with the reviews (such as a high percentage of deceptive or unreliable reviews), and offers an adjusted rating that reflects a more accurate assessment of the product based on the filtered reviews. The service is available as a browser extension and mobile app.</p>
