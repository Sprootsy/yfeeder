 <h3>Summary</h3>
 <p>
 According to the article, the proliferation of streaming services, each with its own subscription fee, is leading to subscription fatigue among viewers. The increasing costs, coupled with the removal of content from platforms, are driving some consumers back to piracy. The golden age of streaming, characterized by affordable access to a vast library of content, appears to be waning. Instead, consumers face a fragmented landscape where they must subscribe to multiple services to watch the shows and movies they want.

 This has created a situation where the costs can quickly exceed those of traditional cable television. Moreover, the practice of removing content to cut costs or for tax write-offs means that even paying subscribers may lose access to shows and films. The article suggests that this combination of rising costs and reduced availability is pushing viewers towards illegal downloading and streaming as a more convenient and affordable alternative. The frustration is not just about the money, but also about the user experience, with many feeling that the value proposition of streaming has diminished significantly. This resurgence of piracy poses a challenge to the streaming industry, which must find ways to offer compelling value and convenience to retain subscribers.
