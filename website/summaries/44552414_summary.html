    The article discusses the emerging challenges that GLP-1 medications, like Ozempic and Wegovy, are posing to the life insurance industry. These drugs, initially developed for type 2 diabetes, have gained popularity for their weight loss effects, leading to widespread use and a growing awareness among life insurance companies. However, the long-term health impacts of GLP-1s, particularly for individuals without diabetes, are not yet fully understood, creating uncertainty for insurers when assessing risk and determining premiums.

  <p>
    Life insurance companies rely on actuarial data and medical evaluations to predict mortality risks. The use of GLP-1s introduces new variables, as insurers must consider not only the individual's weight and health history but also the potential effects of the medication itself. Some concerns include the possibility of unforeseen side effects or health complications arising from long-term use, as well as the potential for individuals to discontinue the medication and regain weight, which could impact their overall health and mortality risk.

  <p>
    The article highlights that some life insurance companies are beginning to ask about GLP-1 usage during the application process. Depending on the insurer and the individual's specific circumstances, GLP-1 use could lead to higher premiums, policy exclusions, or even denial of coverage. Factors that influence these decisions include the reason for taking the medication (diabetes vs. weight loss), the dosage, the duration of use, and the individual's overall health profile.

    The lack of long-term data on GLP-1s presents a significant challenge for insurers. They must balance the potential benefits of weight loss with the unknown risks associated with the drugs. This uncertainty is leading to more cautious underwriting practices and a greater emphasis on individual risk assessment.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article suggests that as GLP-1 usage becomes more prevalent, the life insurance industry will need to adapt and develop new strategies for assessing risk. This may involve gathering more detailed medical information from applicants, conducting further research on the long-term effects of GLP-1s, and potentially creating new risk categories specifically for individuals using these medications.
