<p>The article discusses the eruv, a symbolic enclosure that transforms a public space into a private domain for Orthodox Jews, allowing them to perform activities forbidden in public on the Sabbath, such as carrying objects or pushing strollers. In Manhattan, an eruv was constructed in the early 2000s, primarily using existing structures like buildings, bridges, and utility poles, connected by thin, nearly invisible wires called a "lechis." This wire, often strung along the upper reaches of buildings and infrastructure, effectively creates a continuous boundary around a designated area. The article highlights the meticulous process of establishing the eruv, which involved rabbinical experts, engineers, and city officials. The construction and maintenance of the eruv require constant vigilance and inspections to ensure its continuity, as even small breaks can invalidate the entire enclosure. The article also touches on the controversy surrounding eruvs in some communities, where they have been opposed due to concerns about the separation of church and state or fears of unwanted Jewish influence. However, in Manhattan, the eruv has generally been accepted, providing a significant enhancement to the lives of observant Jews, allowing them greater freedom and participation in community life on the Sabbath.</p>
