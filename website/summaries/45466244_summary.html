<p>The article is a critique of ChatGPT and other similar AI systems by Richard Stallman. He argues that these systems are fundamentally unethical because they are based on surveillance and exploitation of data. Stallman contends that the training data used to build these models often comes from copyrighted works and personal information, acquired without consent or compensation. He views the use of such data as a form of theft and a violation of privacy.</p>

<p>Stallman also criticizes the nature of the responses generated by ChatGPT, stating that they are essentially regurgitations of existing information rather than original thought. He likens the system to a sophisticated parrot, capable of mimicking human language but lacking true understanding or consciousness. He suggests that relying on such systems can lead to intellectual laziness and a decline in critical thinking skills.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Stallman expresses concern about the potential for these AI systems to be used for manipulation and control. He argues that their ability to generate convincing but potentially false information could be exploited for propaganda and other malicious purposes. He also worries about the concentration of power in the hands of the companies that develop and control these technologies.</p>

<p>Stallman advocates for the development and use of AI systems that are ethical and respect user freedom. He suggests that AI should be developed in a transparent and accountable manner, with safeguards in place to protect privacy and prevent misuse. He also emphasizes the importance of promoting critical thinking and independent judgment, so that people are not easily swayed by AI-generated content.</p>

<p>In summary, Stallman's article presents a strong argument against the current trajectory of AI development, particularly concerning systems like ChatGPT. He believes that these systems pose a threat to privacy, intellectual property, and individual autonomy. He calls for a more ethical and responsible approach to AI, one that prioritizes human freedom and well-being.</p>
