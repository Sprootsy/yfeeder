<p>The article discusses the mathematical and computational aspects of folding paper along curved creases. It explores the question of what 3D shapes can be obtained by folding a flat sheet of paper along curved lines, contrasting this with the well-established theory of origami, which deals with folding along straight lines. The author, along with collaborators, has developed a general theory for curved folding, establishing that any smooth surface can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a curved crease folding pattern. This result parallels a similar theorem in traditional origami, which states that any polyhedron can be folded from a flat sheet using straight creases. However, the curved crease result is more complex and nuanced. The folding patterns required to achieve this approximation may involve densely packed, small-amplitude folds.</p>

<p>The article also delves into the challenges of determining the foldability of a given curved crease pattern. Unlike straight-line origami, where simple local rules govern foldability, curved crease patterns pose significant analytical difficulties. The authors have shown that determining whether a given curved crease pattern is foldable is an NP-hard problem, indicating that there is likely no efficient algorithm to solve it in general. This intractability arises from the complex interplay of local curvature and global geometric constraints that govern the folding process.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the article examines the practical aspects of curved folding, including the design and fabrication of curved origami structures. The authors have developed computational tools and techniques to generate curved crease patterns that approximate desired shapes. They have also explored the use of materials with specific mechanical properties to facilitate curved folding and achieve stable, self-supporting structures. The resulting curved origami designs have applications in various fields, including architecture, product design, and robotics, where the ability to create complex 3D shapes from flat materials is highly valuable.</p>

<p>In summary, the article presents a comprehensive overview of the mathematical theory, computational challenges, and practical applications of curved crease folding. It highlights the significant differences between curved and straight-line origami and demonstrates the power of curved folding as a design and manufacturing technique.</p>
