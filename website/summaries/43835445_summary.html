        <h1>Chain of Recursive Thoughts: Make AI think harder by making it argue with itself</h1>
        <p>

  <p>The article on GitHub, titled "Chain-of-Recursive-Thoughts," introduces a novel prompting strategy for large language models (LLMs) called Chain of Recursive Thoughts (CoRT). CoRT aims to enhance the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of LLMs by enabling them to recursively decompose complex problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems. This approach mimics the human problem-solving strategy of breaking down a task into a series of steps and then further refining each step as needed.</p>

  <p>The core concept of CoRT involves prompting the LLM to first generate an initial plan for solving a given problem. This plan outlines the main steps involved. Then, for each step in the plan, the LLM is prompted to recursively break it down into further sub-steps. This recursive decomposition continues until the LLM reaches a level of granularity where each sub-step is simple enough to be executed directly. The LLM then executes these sub-steps, combining the results to solve the original problem.</p>

  <p>The authors argue that CoRT is particularly effective for tasks that require multi-step reasoning and planning, such as mathematical problem-solving, code generation, and logical deduction. By explicitly prompting the LLM to think recursively, CoRT encourages it to explore different solution paths and consider various edge cases, leading to more robust and accurate solutions.</p>

  <p>The article provides examples of how to implement CoRT using specific prompts and demonstrates its effectiveness on several benchmark datasets. The results show that CoRT outperforms other prompting strategies, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, on complex reasoning tasks. The authors attribute this improvement to CoRT's ability to encourage deeper exploration of the problem space and its more structured approach to problem decomposition.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the article discusses the limitations of CoRT, such as the potential for increased computational cost due to the recursive nature of the process. It also acknowledges that the effectiveness of CoRT depends on the quality of the initial plan generated by the LLM. If the initial plan is flawed, the subsequent recursive decomposition may lead to suboptimal solutions.</p>

  <p>The authors also explore potential avenues for future research, such as developing automated methods for optimizing the depth of the recursive decomposition and incorporating external knowledge sources to improve the quality of the initial plan.</p>

  <p>In summary, "Chain-of-Recursive-Thoughts" presents a promising new prompting strategy that can significantly enhance the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of LLMs. By enabling LLMs to recursively decompose complex problems, CoRT encourages a more structured and thorough approach to problem-solving, leading to improved accuracy and robustness.</p>
