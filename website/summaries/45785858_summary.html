    <h2>Visopsys: OS maintained by a single developer since 1997</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p>Visopsys is an alternative operating system for computers, developed since 1997 by Andreas Gerlich. It aims to be small, efficient, and easily understandable, focusing on portability and running on modest hardware. Visopsys has a monolithic kernel design, meaning most operating system services run within the kernel for performance. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) based on its own windowing system rather than relying on X11 or other external systems. Visopsys targets POSIX compliance, which is a standard for operating system interfaces, to enhance compatibility with existing software.</p>

<h2>Key Points:</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Alternative Operating System:</b> Visopsys is presented as a distinct operating system, not a modification or derivative of existing OSes like Linux or BSD.</li>
<li><b>Development History:</b> Development started in 1997, indicating a long-term project with ongoing refinement.</li>
<li><b>Developer:</b> Andreas Gerlich is the primary author and maintainer of Visopsys.</li>
<li><b>Design Goals:</b> The project prioritizes being small, efficient, and understandable, likely targeting embedded systems or older hardware.</li>
<li><b>Portability:</b> One of the main focuses is portability, implying the OS can be adapted to different hardware architectures.</li>
<li><b>Hardware Requirements:</b> The operating system is designed to run on modest hardware, suggesting low resource consumption.</li>
<li><b>Monolithic Kernel:</b> Visopsys uses a monolithic kernel design, which can offer performance advantages but may impact modularity.</li>
<li><b>Graphical User Interface:</b> Visopsys includes its own GUI and windowing system, avoiding reliance on external systems like X11.</li>
<li><b>POSIX Compliance:</b> The OS aims for POSIX compliance to allow easier porting of software and compatibility with standard tools.</li>
