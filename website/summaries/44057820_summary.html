  <p>The article is a blog post by Simon Willison discussing his experiments with using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to generate prompts for Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) for image creation. He details his approach of using Gemini to create both the positive and negative prompts, aiming to leverage Gemini's language understanding capabilities to improve the quality and creativity of the generated images. Willison describes the prompt engineering techniques he employed, including providing Gemini with example prompts and instructions on how to generate prompts. He also explores the use of Gemini's multi-turn conversation ability to refine prompts iteratively. The author shares specific prompts used for Gemini and the resulting images generated by SDXL. He reflects on the strengths and weaknesses of this approach, noting that while Gemini can generate detailed and creative prompts, it sometimes struggles with specific artistic styles or can introduce unexpected elements into the negative prompts. He also comments on the cost of using Gemini and suggests that open-source models might eventually catch up in performance. Willison concludes by expressing optimism about the future of AI-assisted image generation and the potential for combining the strengths of large language models and diffusion models.</p>
