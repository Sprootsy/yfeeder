The article "Belgium Unsafe for CVD" discusses the author's experience as a vulnerability researcher and penetration tester working in Belgium, focusing on the challenges and potential legal risks associated with ethical hacking and responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. The author highlights the strict interpretation and enforcement of computer crime laws in Belgium, particularly concerning unauthorized access to computer systems, even when done with good intentions such as identifying and reporting security flaws.

The author recounts several instances where their attempts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities were met with legal threats or warnings from the affected organizations or even law enforcement. They emphasize that even if a vulnerability is discovered in a system that is publicly accessible or seemingly open for testing, any attempt to verify the vulnerability or demonstrate its impact could be construed as illegal hacking under Belgian law. This creates a chilling effect on security research, as it discourages individuals from proactively identifying and reporting security issues for fear of prosecution.

The article contrasts the legal environment in Belgium with that of other countries where "bug bounty" programs and responsible disclosure policies are more common and legally protected. In these countries, ethical hackers are often given a safe harbor to test and report vulnerabilities without fear of legal repercussions, as long as they adhere to certain guidelines and act in good faith. The author argues that Belgium's restrictive legal framework hinders the improvement of cybersecurity and makes it more difficult for organizations to proactively address vulnerabilities in their systems.

The author also touches upon the complexities of determining what constitutes "unauthorized access" under Belgian law, especially in the context of modern web applications and APIs. They point out that many systems are designed to be accessed by various clients and services, and it can be difficult to determine whether a particular access pattern is considered legitimate or unauthorized. This ambiguity further exacerbates the legal risks for vulnerability researchers, as they may inadvertently cross the line into illegal activity without realizing it.

<p>
The article concludes by urging Belgian lawmakers and legal authorities to reconsider their approach to computer crime and to create a more supportive environment for ethical hacking and responsible disclosure. The author suggests that adopting a more flexible and nuanced interpretation of existing laws, or even introducing specific legal protections for vulnerability researchers, could significantly improve the overall security posture of Belgian organizations and infrastructure. They argue that fostering collaboration between security researchers and organizations, rather than treating all unauthorized access as criminal activity, is essential for building a more secure digital ecosystem.
