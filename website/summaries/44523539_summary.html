<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The National Crime Agency (NCA) has arrested four individuals suspected of launching cyber attacks against major UK retailers, including M&S, Co-op, and Harrods. The suspects are believed to be part of a hacking group responsible for deploying Remote Access Trojans (RATs) to steal customer data and potentially carry out further malicious activities. The arrests were made following a joint operation involving the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) and regional law enforcement partners.
</p>
<p>
The investigation was initiated after the retailers reported suspicious activity on their systems. NCA investigators identified the use of sophisticated malware designed to bypass security measures and exfiltrate sensitive information. The suspects are accused of using the stolen data for financial gain, potentially through fraud or the sale of the information on the dark web.
</p>
<p>
During the arrests, digital devices were seized and are currently undergoing forensic analysis. The NCA is working to determine the full extent of the data breach and the potential impact on customers. The investigation is ongoing, and further arrests may be made as the inquiry progresses. The NCA emphasized the severity of cybercrime and its commitment to bringing perpetrators to justice.
</p>
<p>
The agency is also collaborating with the affected retailers to enhance their cybersecurity measures and prevent future attacks. The NCA urges businesses to remain vigilant and implement robust security protocols to protect customer data. They also encourage individuals to report any suspected cybercrime to Action Fraud.
