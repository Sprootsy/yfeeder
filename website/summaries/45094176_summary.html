<p>The Financial Times article discusses the increasing trend of companies, particularly in the US, prioritizing profit margins over volume growth. This shift is driven by a combination of factors, including rising costs (labor, materials), supply chain disruptions, and a change in corporate strategy focused on efficiency and pricing power. Companies are finding that they can maintain or even increase profitability by selling fewer products at higher prices. This approach is particularly evident in sectors like consumer goods and food, where major brands have been able to raise prices without significantly impacting demand due to strong brand loyalty and limited competition.</p>

<p>The article highlights examples of companies like Coca-Cola and Mondelez, which have successfully implemented this strategy. Despite selling fewer units, these companies have reported strong revenue and profit growth due to higher prices. This trend is not limited to large corporations; smaller businesses are also adopting similar tactics to cope with inflationary pressures and maintain profitability.</p>

<p>However, the article also points out potential risks associated with this strategy. While it can be effective in the short term, continuously raising prices without a corresponding increase in value could alienate customers and lead to a decline in long-term sales volume. Moreover, this trend contributes to inflationary pressures in the economy, potentially leading to a consumer backlash or government intervention.</p>

<p>The shift towards prioritizing profit margins also reflects a change in investor expectations. Shareholders are increasingly focused on profitability and return on investment, rather than simply top-line growth. This puts pressure on companies to improve efficiency and maximize pricing power, even if it means sacrificing some sales volume. The article suggests that this trend could have broader implications for the economy, potentially leading to slower overall growth and increased inequality if companies continue to prioritize profits over expanding their customer base.</p>

<p>The article concludes by noting that while the focus on profit margins may be a rational response to current economic conditions, it is not without its challenges. Companies need to carefully balance the desire for higher profits with the need to maintain customer loyalty and competitiveness in the long run. Additionally, policymakers need to be aware of the potential inflationary consequences of this trend and consider appropriate measures to mitigate its impact on consumers.</p>
