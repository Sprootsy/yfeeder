  <p>
    Fang is a Go framework created by Charmbracelet for building command-line applications (CLIs). It emphasizes simplicity, ease of use, and a delightful developer experience. It leverages modern Go features and design patterns to streamline CLI development, handling common tasks such as argument parsing, command dispatch, help generation, and configuration management.
  </p>
  <p>
    The framework is designed to be intuitive and approachable, even for developers new to Go or CLI development. It provides a structured approach to building CLIs, promoting code organization and maintainability. Fang's core features include a declarative command definition system using Go structs and annotations.  This allows developers to define commands, subcommands, and flags with minimal boilerplate code. The framework automatically generates help messages and documentation based on these definitions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fang handles argument parsing and validation, ensuring that user input conforms to the defined command structure. It provides mechanisms for defining required and optional flags, as well as custom validation rules.  The framework supports different data types for flags, including strings, integers, booleans, and lists.  It also allows for the definition of environment variables and configuration files to customize the CLI's behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
    Command dispatch is another key feature of Fang.  It automatically routes commands to their corresponding handler functions based on the user's input. This simplifies the process of managing complex CLI applications with multiple subcommands.  Fang also provides a mechanism for defining global flags that apply to all commands.
  </p>
  <p>
    Help generation is another aspect of Fang.  The framework automatically generates help messages for each command, including usage instructions, flag descriptions, and subcommand listings.  The generated help messages are customizable, allowing developers to tailor them to their specific needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fang simplifies configuration management.  It supports loading configuration values from environment variables, configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON), and command-line flags.  It can merge these different configuration sources, allowing users to override default values.
  </p>
  <p>
    Error handling is also addressed by Fang.  It provides a consistent way to handle errors that occur during command execution, allowing developers to provide informative error messages to the user.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, Fang aims to simplify CLI development in Go by providing a well-structured framework that handles common tasks, promotes code organization, and delivers a delightful developer experience. Its declarative approach, automated help generation, and robust configuration management make it a valuable tool for building modern command-line applications.
