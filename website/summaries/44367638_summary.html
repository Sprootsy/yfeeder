    The article delves into the intensifying rivalry between OpenAI and Microsoft, primarily fueled by their competing AI models, ChatGPT and Copilot. Despite Microsoft's significant investment in and partnership with OpenAI, tensions are rising as both companies vie for dominance in the AI market. The heart of the conflict lies in the overlapping functionalities of ChatGPT and Copilot, both designed to assist users with a wide range of tasks, from answering questions to generating content.
