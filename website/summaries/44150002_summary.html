<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The article discusses Atari's attempt to enter the business computer market with the Atari Mega ST line in the late 1980s. It highlights Atari's strategy to leverage its existing 68000-based ST platform to compete with established business computers like the IBM PC. The Mega ST aimed to offer a more powerful and expandable system compared to the standard ST, focusing on features appealing to businesses, such as increased RAM, a detachable keyboard, and a more professional-looking design.</p>

<p>The article details the specifications and design of the Mega ST computers, including the Mega ST 1, Mega ST 2, and Mega ST 4. It mentions the inclusion of a blitter chip in some models, enhancing graphics performance. The Mega ST's improved keyboard and overall aesthetics were intended to appeal to office environments. The article also touches on the Megafile hard drives, which were a key component of Atari's business-oriented offering, providing the storage capacity needed for business applications and data.</p>

<p>However, the article also points out the challenges Atari faced. Despite the Mega ST's technical capabilities, the business market was already dominated by IBM PCs and compatibles. The availability of software and peripherals for the PC was a significant advantage that Atari struggled to overcome. Furthermore, the perception of Atari as a gaming company hindered its acceptance in the more serious business world.</p>

<p>The article also mentions the later Mega STE, an enhanced version of the Mega ST that included improved sound capabilities and real-time clock. While the Mega STE offered some advantages, it was ultimately too late to make a significant impact on the business market.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the article portrays the Atari Mega ST as a capable machine with the potential to compete in the business market. However, due to factors such as established competition, software availability, and Atari's image, the Mega ST ultimately failed to gain significant traction in the business sector.</p>
