<p>The article is a recommendation to switch to Kagi, a paid search engine, written in April 2025. The author, John Gruber, explains that while he previously resisted the idea of paying for search, the declining quality of Google Search has led him to reconsider. He describes how Google's search results have become increasingly filled with SEO-optimized spam, intrusive ads, and AI-generated content, making it difficult to find genuinely useful and relevant information. The author highlights that this degradation is driven by Google's incentive to prioritize profit over user experience, pushing them to promote content that generates revenue, even if it's low quality.</p>

<p>Gruber then presents Kagi as a viable alternative. He acknowledges that Kagi is not free, requiring a monthly subscription, but argues that the improved search quality and user experience are worth the cost. He praises Kagi's focus on surfacing relevant information, its clean and ad-free interface, and its user-friendly features. He discusses Kagi's emphasis on privacy, assuring that it doesn't track user data for advertising purposes. The author also appreciates Kagi's innovative features, such as the ability to personalize search results by prioritizing or demoting specific websites or domains. This level of control allows users to filter out irrelevant content and tailor their search experience to their individual needs.</p>

<p>The article further elaborates on the specific benefits that prompted the author to switch to Kagi. He mentions that finding reliable and informative content has become noticeably easier, and the time saved by avoiding SEO-optimized spam justifies the subscription fee. He emphasizes that Kagi's focus on quality content, rather than revenue generation, has resulted in a more satisfying and productive search experience. The author concedes that Kagi may not be perfect or suitable for everyone, but strongly recommends trying it, particularly for those who are frustrated with the current state of Google Search. He believes that Kagi offers a glimpse into a future where search engines prioritize user needs over advertising revenue, ultimately delivering a more valuable and efficient search experience.</p>

<p>In summary, the author's perspective in 2025 is that Google Search has significantly declined in quality due to its prioritization of advertising revenue over user experience, making Kagi a worthwhile alternative for those willing to pay for a better search experience.</p>
