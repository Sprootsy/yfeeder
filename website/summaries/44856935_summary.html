  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    The provided link points to the GitHub repository for Bolt, a high-performance, zero-copy framework for processing live financial market data. Bolt is designed to handle the demands of modern trading infrastructure, focusing on speed, efficiency, and minimal overhead. It leverages techniques like zero-copy deserialization and optimized data structures to achieve its performance goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bolt's architecture is built around a pipeline of stages that process incoming market data. Each stage performs a specific task, such as decoding messages, normalizing data, or executing trading logic. The framework allows developers to customize and extend these stages to fit their specific needs. A key feature is its zero-copy design, which avoids unnecessary data copying, reducing latency and memory usage.  This is achieved by directly accessing the data within the network buffers where the data first arrives, avoiding the overhead of copying this data into other memory locations before processing.
  </p>
  <p>
    The framework supports various market data protocols and formats, including those commonly used in the financial industry. It provides tools for defining data schemas and generating code for efficient data access. This abstraction allows developers to work with market data in a type-safe and consistent manner, regardless of the underlying protocol. Bolt's modular design enables developers to easily integrate new protocols and data sources.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, Bolt emphasizes robustness and reliability. It includes features for handling errors, monitoring performance, and ensuring data integrity. The framework is designed to operate in demanding production environments, where uptime and data accuracy are critical.  It provides facilities for logging and metrics collection, allowing operators to monitor the health and performance of the system.  The framework's error handling mechanisms allow developers to gracefully handle unexpected situations and prevent data loss.
  </p>
  <p>
    The repository includes code examples and documentation to help developers get started with Bolt. It provides guidance on how to build and deploy Bolt-based applications, as well as best practices for optimizing performance. The project encourages community contributions and provides a platform for developers to share their experiences and insights.
