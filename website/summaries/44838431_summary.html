    <h2>AWS&#39;s sudden removal of a 10-year account and all of its data: lessons learned</h2>
    <div>
 <div>
 <h3>Summary</h3>
 <p>The article details the author's experience of AWS deleting a 10-year-old account without prior warning, resulting in permanent data loss. The author had used the account primarily for personal projects, experiments, and storing backups, including family photos and videos. The deletion occurred due to a forgotten root email address. Despite the account being active and billed regularly for storage, AWS initiated the deletion process after the credit card on file expired and the payment failed. AWS sent notifications regarding the payment failure to the root email address, which the author no longer had access to.</p>
 
 <p>The author argues that AWS's deletion policy is excessively aggressive, especially for long-term accounts with significant data. He highlights the lack of sufficient warnings and the short timeframe provided to rectify the payment issue before initiating permanent data deletion. He suggests that AWS should implement more robust measures to prevent accidental data loss, such as sending notifications to alternative email addresses or phone numbers associated with the account and implementing a longer grace period before deletion. Additionally, the author criticizes AWS's customer support for being unhelpful and unsympathetic to the situation.</p>
 
 <p>The article also delves into the broader implications of cloud data storage and the importance of data redundancy and backups. The author stresses that relying solely on a single cloud provider for data storage is risky and emphasizes the need for a multi-cloud or hybrid cloud approach to ensure data availability and resilience. He also advises readers to regularly review their AWS account settings, update contact information, and set up billing alerts to avoid similar situations.</p>
 
 <p>Furthermore, the author reflects on the emotional impact of losing irreplaceable data, such as family memories, and underscores the importance of valuing and protecting personal data. He urges readers to take proactive steps to safeguard their data and avoid complacency when using cloud storage services.</p>
