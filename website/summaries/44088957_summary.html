The article discusses Denmark's plan to raise the retirement age to 70 by 2035. This measure is being considered to ensure the sustainability of the welfare state in the face of an aging population and increasing life expectancy. The proposal is based on a 2020 agreement among political parties to link the retirement age to life expectancy. With Danes living longer, the government argues that it is necessary to work longer to maintain the current level of social benefits and pensions.

The move is projected to affect those born in 1973 or later, giving them ample time to prepare for a later retirement. The government emphasizes that this adjustment is essential to secure the financial stability of the welfare system and to ensure that future generations can also benefit from it. While the proposal has sparked debate, supporters argue that it is a responsible and necessary step to adapt to demographic changes. Critics, however, express concerns about the impact on workers in physically demanding jobs and those who may not be able to work until 70 due to health issues or other reasons. The Danish government defends its position by pointing out that similar adjustments have been made in the past, and that the country's strong social safety net will continue to provide support for those who are unable to work.
