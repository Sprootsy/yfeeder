Minnesota state Senator Nicole Mitchell was arrested on suspicion of first-degree burglary at a residence in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, on Monday. According to a criminal complaint, Mitchell entered the home, which she believed belonged to her stepmother, intending to retrieve items that belonged to her deceased father. Police were called to the scene around 4:45 a.m. by a woman who reported that Mitchell had entered her home. Officers found Mitchell inside the residence, dressed in black, with a bag containing items. Mitchell reportedly told police that her father had recently passed away and her stepmother had cut off contact with her family. She stated she wanted to take some of her father's belongings.

The woman who called the police is believed to be Mitchell's stepmother. The criminal complaint indicates that the stepmother felt Mitchell posed a threat. Mitchell, a Democrat representing the Woodbury area, was booked into the Becker County Jail. The Minnesota Senate is currently adjourned, but her potential absence could impact the balance of power in the narrowly divided chamber. The Senate is currently controlled by the DFL (Democratic-Farmer-Labor) party with a one-seat majority. Republican leaders have called for Mitchell's resignation, while DFL leaders have stated they are gathering information and will take appropriate action.
