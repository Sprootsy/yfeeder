    <h2>EU court rules nuclear energy is clean energy</h2>
    <div>

  <p>According to the article, the EU Court of Justice has dismissed a complaint against the inclusion of nuclear energy in the EU's list of environmentally sustainable economic activities, known as the "taxonomy." This taxonomy guides private investments toward climate-friendly projects. The court rejected Austria's challenge, which argued that including nuclear energy in the taxonomy violated EU laws and standards. Austria, supported by Germany and Luxembourg, raised concerns about nuclear waste disposal and the potential for nuclear accidents.</p>
  <p>The court stated that it doesn't have the power to substitute its own assessment for that of the EU legislature on complex scientific and technical matters unless the legislature's assessment is manifestly incorrect. It found that the EU Commission's decision to include nuclear energy was based on expert opinions and that the conditions for its inclusion are clearly defined, including requirements for safe waste management. The court acknowledged the risks associated with nuclear energy but emphasized that the EU legislature had taken these into account.</p>
  <p>Moreover, the court said that the EU taxonomy regulation does not establish a support scheme for nuclear energy, nor does it compel member states or private investors to support it. The inclusion in the taxonomy only means that nuclear energy can be considered an environmentally sustainable investment under certain conditions.</p>
  <p>The decision has been met with mixed reactions. Supporters of nuclear energy argue that it is a crucial part of the EU's strategy to achieve carbon neutrality and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Opponents maintain that nuclear energy poses unacceptable environmental and safety risks and that investments should be directed towards renewable energy sources instead.</p>
  <p>The article also notes that this ruling could have implications for future energy policy decisions in the EU, as it confirms the EU's ability to classify nuclear energy as a sustainable investment despite opposition from some member states. The decision highlights the ongoing debate within the EU about the role of nuclear energy in the transition to a low-carbon economy.</p>
