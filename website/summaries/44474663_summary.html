  <p>The article discusses the reaction of adult content creators to the upcoming Online Safety Act in the UK, which is set to ban online purchases of adult material using credit or debit cards. Many creators fear this will significantly impact their income and ability to work safely. They argue that the current system, while not perfect, offers a layer of security by allowing them to verify buyers and prevent unwanted exposure of their content. The new law is perceived by some as removing a relatively safe method of transaction, potentially pushing creators towards riskier, less regulated platforms or methods of payment. There are concerns that the ban might disproportionately affect marginalized creators who rely on these platforms for income and safety. Some creators are considering leaving the UK market altogether, while others are exploring alternative payment methods, although these may present new challenges. The law aims to protect children and vulnerable individuals from harmful content, but some adult content creators believe it will ultimately harm those working within the industry by depriving them of a secure way to monetize their work.</p>
