    <h2>Gleam OTP â€“ Fault Tolerant Multicore Programs with Actors</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <p>The Gleam OTP library provides a collection of Erlang OTP behaviours, modules, and types designed for use within Gleam projects. It offers a way to build robust, concurrent, and distributed applications, taking advantage of the battle-tested features of the Erlang ecosystem within the type-safe Gleam language.
  </p>
  <p>
    This library includes several key components:
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Behaviours:</b> It provides implementations of standard Erlang/OTP behaviours such as `gen_server`, `gen_statem`, `supervisor`, and `application`. These behaviours offer a structured way to define concurrent processes with specific roles and responsibilities. The `gen_server` behaviour is for implementing client-server interactions, managing state, and handling asynchronous requests. The `gen_statem` behaviour is for building state machines with complex transitions and actions. The `supervisor` behaviour is used to create process hierarchies that automatically restart failed processes, ensuring system resilience. The `application` behaviour defines how an application starts, stops, and manages its dependencies.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Modules:</b> The library includes modules that offer utilities and functions for working with OTP concepts, such as process management, message passing, and supervision trees. These modules often provide Gleam-friendly wrappers around existing Erlang OTP functions, making them easier to use within Gleam code.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Types:</b> It defines Gleam types that correspond to Erlang OTP data structures, such as process identifiers (`pid`), atoms, and tuples. This allows for seamless interaction between Gleam code and Erlang code within the same OTP application.
  </p>
  <p>
    The library aims to provide a Gleam-idiomatic interface to OTP functionality, making it easier for Gleam developers to build concurrent and distributed systems. It leverages Gleam's type system and functional programming features to ensure code correctness and maintainability. By using this library, Gleam developers can take advantage of the robust and proven OTP framework without sacrificing the benefits of Gleam's type safety and developer experience.
