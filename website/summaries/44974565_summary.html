  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article "Anki Is Already Dead" by Miguel Conner presents a contrarian view on the popular spaced repetition software, Anki. Conner argues that while Anki is effective for memorizing facts, it ultimately fails to promote genuine understanding and critical thinking. He contends that relying heavily on rote memorization through Anki can hinder deeper learning and the ability to apply knowledge in novel situations. The author suggests that true learning involves making connections, questioning assumptions, and engaging with the material in a more active and meaningful way, something Anki does not inherently facilitate.

    Conner supports his argument by highlighting the limitations of spaced repetition itself. He claims that spaced repetition is best suited for factual recall and that it struggles to accommodate more complex concepts and nuanced understanding. He posits that over-reliance on Anki can lead to a superficial grasp of the subject matter, where individuals can regurgitate information without truly comprehending its significance or implications. Furthermore, he criticizes the time investment required to create and maintain Anki decks, suggesting that this time could be better spent on more active and engaging learning methods, such as reading, discussing, and applying knowledge.

    The author doesn't dismiss Anki entirely but argues for a more balanced approach to learning. He suggests that Anki can be a useful tool for memorizing specific facts and vocabulary, but it should not be the primary method for learning complex subjects. Instead, he advocates for a more holistic approach that prioritizes understanding, critical thinking, and the ability to apply knowledge in real-world situations. He champions techniques like concept mapping, active recall without spaced repetition, and engaging in discussions with others to foster deeper learning.

    The article also touches on the potential for Anki to create a false sense of competence. By successfully recalling information through spaced repetition, individuals may overestimate their understanding of the subject matter. This can lead to a lack of motivation to engage in more challenging learning activities, further hindering the development of genuine expertise. Conner concludes by urging readers to critically evaluate their learning methods and to prioritize understanding over mere memorization. He encourages them to explore alternative learning strategies that promote deeper engagement and critical thinking, rather than relying solely on Anki as a crutch.
