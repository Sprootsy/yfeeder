<p>This Washington Post article delves into newly declassified JFK assassination files, focusing on the CIA's relationship with individuals who had connections to Lee Harvey Oswald. The investigation highlights the CIA's efforts to protect its sources and methods, even when those sources had potential ties to Oswald before the assassination. Specifically, the article examines George Joannides, a CIA officer who was involved in discrediting critics of the Warren Commission and who, years earlier, had been the case officer for a group with connections to Oswald. The article suggests that the CIA withheld information about Joannides's earlier role, raising questions about transparency and potential conflicts of interest. The author also discusses the challenges faced by researchers in accessing and interpreting the remaining classified documents, pointing out how redactions and the passage of time hinder a full understanding of events surrounding the assassination.</p>
