  <p>The article is a post to the silklist@lists.hserus.net mailing list concerning the status of the SILK project as of November 2007. It details the transition of leadership and ongoing maintenance. The original author, known as 'Grey', handed over the project leadership to Dave 'dd' Neary. Grey outlines the tasks he still intended to complete before fully stepping down, which include some outstanding DNS changes, migrating the project's resources to a new server ('catseye'), and ensuring a smooth handover of administrative access and responsibilities. He expressed wanting to see the SILK project continue with updated releases of SILKEdit, SILKView, and SILKProfile. He also encouraged other members to contribute, especially in terms of code maintenance, testing, documentation, and platform support, which are particularly vital for the long-term viability of the SILK project. The post mentions that the new server 'catseye' is running Debian and that the list configuration will remain as is, although it needs to be moved. Grey expresses gratitude to those who have contributed to SILK over the years. He also mentions being willing to help dd in the beginning if needed. The email finishes by expressing confidence in dd's ability to maintain and guide SILK, and he looks forward to its continued development.</p>
