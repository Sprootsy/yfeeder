  <p>The article is a comprehensive guide on how to play the game of Go, hosted on the online-go.com website. It begins by explaining the fundamental concepts, starting with the objective of the game: to control more territory than your opponent. Territory is defined as empty points surrounded by one's own stones. The game is played on a grid, typically 19x19, and players alternate placing stones of their color (black or white) on the intersections of the grid lines.</p>
  <p>The guide then delves into the core mechanics of Go. A key concept is that of "liberties." A liberty is an open point directly adjacent to a stone or a connected group of stones. When a group of stones has no liberties, it is captured and removed from the board. This capture mechanism is crucial for both attacking the opponent and defending one's own territory. The article provides clear examples to illustrate how stones are captured and how to avoid being captured.</p>
  <p>The guide explains the concept of "eyes." An eye is an empty point completely surrounded by one's own stones. A group with two or more eyes is unconditionally alive and cannot be captured, making eyes a crucial defensive element. Creating eyes is a primary strategy for securing territory and ensuring the survival of groups of stones.</p>
  <p>The article addresses the "ko" rule. A ko situation arises when a capture immediately recreates the position that allowed the capture. To prevent infinite loops, the ko rule dictates that a player cannot recapture immediately; they must play elsewhere first. This adds a layer of strategic complexity to the game.</p>
  <p>The guide also covers the concept of "seki," a situation where two groups are alive because neither can capture the other without being captured themselves. This is another way groups can remain alive without having two eyes.</p>
  <p>The guide explains how to end the game. The game ends when both players agree that no more profitable moves can be made. At this point, the players count the territory they control (empty points surrounded by their stones) and any captured stones. The player with the most territory wins.</p>
  <p>The article touches upon the handicap system in Go. Weaker players can be given a handicap of extra stones at the start of the game to even the playing field. The guide also mentions the komi, which is a point adjustment given to White to compensate for Black's advantage of moving first.</p>
  <p>Finally, the article encourages readers to practice playing Go, using the online-go.com platform as a resource. It emphasizes that Go is a game of strategy and intuition that improves with practice.</p>
