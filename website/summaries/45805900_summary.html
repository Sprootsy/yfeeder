<p>The article "Things You Can Do With Diodes" by lcamtuf explores various practical applications of diodes beyond their basic function as rectifiers. It emphasizes that diodes are versatile components with numerous uses in electronics, often overlooked due to their simplicity. The article begins by discussing the fundamental properties of diodes, highlighting their ability to allow current to flow in one direction while blocking it in the opposite direction. This characteristic makes them essential for rectification, converting AC voltage to DC voltage, a function commonly found in power supplies.</p>

<p>Beyond rectification, the article delves into several interesting applications. One is using diodes for overvoltage protection. Diodes can be configured to clamp voltage spikes, safeguarding sensitive components from damage. This is particularly useful in protecting circuits from electrostatic discharge (ESD) or voltage surges. The author explains how Zener diodes, designed to break down at a specific voltage, are particularly effective in voltage regulation and overvoltage protection.</p>

<p>Another application discussed is using diodes for logic gates. While not as efficient as transistors in digital logic, diodes can be used to create simple AND and OR gates. The article illustrates how these gates function based on the forward voltage drop of the diodes, which can be a useful technique for basic digital circuits or signal processing. Diode logic was extensively used in early computers.</p>

<p>The piece also covers the use of diodes in signal demodulation. Diodes can be used to extract information from modulated signals, particularly amplitude-modulated (AM) signals. This involves using a diode to rectify the AM signal and then filtering out the carrier frequency, leaving behind the original audio signal. This technique is fundamental in AM radio receivers.</p>

<p>The article explores the application of diodes in temperature sensing. The forward voltage of a diode is temperature-dependent; as the temperature increases, the forward voltage decreases. This characteristic can be used to create simple temperature sensors. The author details how to measure this voltage change and calibrate it to create a temperature measurement device.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the article touches on using diodes as switches, especially in high-frequency applications. PIN diodes, designed for this purpose, can switch rapidly between conductive and non-conductive states based on the applied voltage. This makes them useful in RF circuits, such as attenuators and switches.</p>

<p>The author notes that while these applications are valuable, it's important to consider the limitations of diodes, such as their forward voltage drop and switching speed. These limitations might make other components, such as transistors, a better choice in some scenarios. However, diodes remain a cost-effective and simple solution for many electronic applications.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the article emphasizes the versatility of diodes and encourages exploration beyond their basic function. From voltage protection to signal demodulation and temperature sensing, diodes offer a range of possibilities for electronic design, making them an indispensable tool in electronics.</p>
