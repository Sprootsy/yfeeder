    <h2>The Untold History of Arduino (2016)</h2>
    <div>

<p>The Arduino project emerged from the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea (IDII) in Italy, aiming to provide an easy-to-use tool for students to create interactive projects. At IDII, students, particularly those without extensive engineering backgrounds, found existing microcontrollers like the BASIC Stamp difficult to use. This led Massimo Banzi, an IDII professor, to explore alternatives, initially focusing on the Wiring prototyping platform developed by Hernando Barragán. Wiring, while successful, was relatively expensive to produce in large quantities.</p>

<p>Banzi, along with IDII staff members David Cuartielles and David Mellis, sought to create a cheaper alternative to Wiring for the students. They decided to build their own board and simplified the development environment. Gianluca Martino, a staff member with expertise in physical computing, was brought on board. He suggested using an Atmel AVR microcontroller, which was more cost-effective than the microcontrollers used in Wiring. Martino also had the expertise to develop a cheaper board layout.</p>

<p>The name "Arduino" comes from a bar in Ivrea, Italy, named after Arduino of Ivrea, who was the King of Italy from 1002 to 1014. Banzi frequented the bar, and the name was chosen somewhat randomly during a brainstorming session.</p>

<p>The initial Arduino team consisted of Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, David Mellis, Gianluca Martino, and later, Tom Igoe. They focused on creating a board that was easy to program and use, even for individuals without a strong technical background. The software was based on Processing, a visual programming language, which further simplified the development process. The Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) was designed to be user-friendly, and the Arduino language was a simplified version of C++.</p>

<p>A key decision was to make the Arduino hardware and software open source. This allowed anyone to download the designs, modify them, and even produce their own Arduino boards. This open-source approach fostered a large community of users and developers, which contributed significantly to Arduino's widespread adoption. This also allowed for the creation of numerous Arduino-compatible boards and shields (add-on modules) that extended the functionality of the Arduino platform.</p>

<p>Early versions of the Arduino board were hand-assembled. The first official Arduino board was the Arduino Serial, followed by the Arduino Diecimila. As the project grew, the team faced challenges related to manufacturing, distribution, and intellectual property. Conflicts arose among the core team members, particularly regarding the management of the Arduino brand and the direction of the project.</p>

<p>In 2008, five of the original founders created a new company, Smart Projects, which manufactured and distributed Arduino boards. Gianluca Martino, one of the founders, owned the Arduino trademark at the time. Over time, disagreements escalated, leading to a split within the Arduino team. Massimo Banzi and other founders established a separate company, Arduino LLC, while Gianluca Martino retained control of the Arduino trademark in Italy. This resulted in legal battles and confusion in the Arduino community.</p>

<p>The conflict over the Arduino trademark was eventually resolved in 2016, with the creation of Arduino Holding. This new entity unified the Arduino brand and ensured the continued development and availability of the Arduino platform. Despite the internal conflicts, the Arduino project has been remarkably successful. It has become a standard platform for hobbyists, artists, designers, and educators, enabling them to create a wide range of interactive projects, from simple robots to complex sensor networks. The open-source nature of Arduino has been a key factor in its success, fostering innovation and collaboration within the global Arduino community.</p>
