    The article defines a ChatGPT Agent as a custom version of ChatGPT tailored for specific tasks or domains. These agents are designed to be more efficient and effective by incorporating specific instructions, knowledge, and skills. Key to an agent's capabilities are tools, which allow it to interact with the real world, expanding its functionality beyond simple text generation.

    The main components of an agent include instructions (defining the agent's role and behavior), knowledge (providing relevant information), and tools (enabling interaction with external resources). Instructions guide the agent's responses and actions, ensuring they align with the desired purpose. Knowledge can be uploaded or accessed, enabling the agent to provide more informed and accurate outputs. Tools are functions that the agent can use to perform specific actions, such as retrieving real-time data, sending emails, or interacting with other APIs.
