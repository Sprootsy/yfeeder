<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>A new California law, Assembly Bill 1112, is set to limit the fines Homeowners Associations (HOAs) can impose on homeowners for violating community rules. Effective January 1, 2025, the law caps fines at $500 for most violations and $1,000 for repeat violations. It also stipulates that HOAs must provide a 30-day warning before issuing a fine, allowing homeowners time to correct the issue. The bill aims to address concerns that some HOAs have been issuing excessive and arbitrary fines, creating financial burdens for homeowners and leading to disputes. Exceptions to the fine limits exist for safety violations or situations posing an imminent threat to the community.</p>
<p>Authored by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath, AB 1112 seeks to strike a balance between HOAs' ability to enforce community standards and protecting homeowners from unreasonable financial penalties. The new regulations are expected to bring greater transparency and fairness to HOA fine practices across California.</p>
