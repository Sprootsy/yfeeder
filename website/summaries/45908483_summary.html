<p>On November 13, 2026, Voyager 1 will reach a significant milestone: it will be one full light-day away from Earth. A light-day is the distance light travels in one day, approximately 18 billion miles or 28.8 billion kilometers. Voyager 1, launched in 1977, has been traveling for nearly 50 years and is currently the farthest human-made object from our planet. It is traveling at roughly 38,000 mph (61,155 km/h). The immense distance means that it takes radio signals about 24 hours to travel between Earth and Voyager 1.</p>

<p>The Voyager program initially aimed to study Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 1 successfully completed these flybys and provided valuable data about these planets and their moons. The probe continued its journey outward, eventually crossing into interstellar space in 2012. Voyager 1 continues to send back data, although its power is diminishing due to the decay of its radioactive thermoelectric generators. Scientists anticipate that the probe will no longer be able to power its instruments by around 2025. However, before that happens, on November 13, 2026, Voyager 1 will reach one full light-day away from Earth.</p>
