<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The Institute for Policy Studies' "Executive Excess 2025" report examines the disparity between CEO pay and worker pay at S&amp;P 500 companies, particularly those with low median worker wages. The report analyzes data from 2023, highlighting companies where CEO compensation far outstripped that of their employees. The study focuses on the 100 S&amp;P 500 companies with the lowest median worker pay in 2023. It reveals the extent to which CEO compensation packages have grown relative to worker wages over several decades, with CEO pay increasing much faster than worker pay. The report also addresses the issue of stock buybacks and their effect on executive compensation. Stock buybacks are used to artificially inflate a company's stock price, which in turn increases the value of stock-based executive compensation.</p>
<p>The report suggests policy recommendations to curb excessive executive compensation and reduce income inequality. These include raising the corporate tax rate for companies with high CEO-to-worker pay ratios, ending tax deductibility for excessive executive pay, and increasing taxes on stock buybacks. Additionally, the report advocates for giving workers more power within companies, such as employee representation on corporate boards and increasing the minimum wage.</p>
