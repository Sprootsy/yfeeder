    The article is a detailed account by Joe Wintergreen about creating a mod to fix the lip-syncing issues in the original Deus Ex game. He explains that the game's lip-syncing, while present, was severely hampered by technical limitations and design choices. The animations were rudimentary and often didn't match the spoken dialogue, resulting in a distracting and immersion-breaking experience.

    Wintergreen outlines his motivations for creating the mod, stemming from his long-time appreciation for Deus Ex and his dissatisfaction with this particular aspect of the game. He also discusses the technical challenges involved. He first investigated the game's animation files and discovered that the lip-sync data was stored within the .ukx files, specifically in the form of AnimNotify tracks. Each track corresponded to a viseme (a visual representation of a phoneme).

    He then describes his workflow, which involved extracting the audio files from the game, running them through a lip-syncing analysis tool called Papagayo, and using the generated data to create new AnimNotify tracks. The Papagayo software analyzes audio and allows you to manually adjust the timing and assignment of visemes to specific points in the audio waveform. He discusses the importance of manual correction, as automated lip-syncing is rarely perfect.

    The article also details his method for importing the modified animation data back into the game. This involved using a custom UnrealEd build, as the standard editor had limitations that prevented him from directly importing the data. He goes into the technical aspects of working with the Unreal Engine's animation system and the specifics of the .ukx file format. He discusses the painstaking process of replacing the existing, inaccurate lip-sync data with his new, improved data.

    Wintergreen also provides insight into the difficulties encountered during the project, such as dealing with inconsistencies in the audio files, limitations of the Papagayo software, and the sheer volume of dialogue in the game. He discusses his decision to prioritize lip-syncing for key characters and scenes, rather than attempting to fix every single line of dialogue.

    The article then touches upon the release and reception of his mod. He describes his process of testing and refining the mod, and talks about the positive feedback he received from the Deus Ex community. He provides information about how players can install and use the mod.

    Finally, Wintergreen reflects on the project as a whole, emphasizing the challenges and rewards of modding a classic game. He shares his thoughts on the importance of community contributions to preserving and enhancing older games.
