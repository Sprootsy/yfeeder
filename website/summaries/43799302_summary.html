        <h1>Wikipediaâ€™s nonprofit status questioned by D.C. U.S. attorney</h1>
        <p>
<div>
<p>According to an article in the Washington Post, Ed Martin, a software engineer, has written an open letter expressing concerns about the Wikimedia Foundation's (WMF) spending and priorities. Martin's letter, addressed to the WMF, criticizes the foundation for what he sees as excessive spending on staff and consultants, particularly on initiatives not directly related to improving Wikipedia's core functionality and content. He argues that the WMF has strayed from its original mission of providing free access to knowledge and has become overly bureaucratic and focused on tangential projects.</p>

<p>The article highlights Martin's specific criticisms, which include the large number of WMF staff compared to the number of active Wikipedia editors, the high salaries of executives, and the investment in projects that he believes are not essential to Wikipedia's success. He suggests that the WMF should prioritize investments in improving the editing experience, attracting and retaining editors, and ensuring the stability and reliability of the Wikipedia platform.</p>

<p>The Washington Post article presents Martin's letter as part of a growing chorus of concerns within the Wikipedia community about the WMF's direction. While the WMF has defended its spending and strategic priorities, arguing that they are necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability and relevance of Wikipedia, Martin's letter and the broader debate it represents raise important questions about the balance between expanding the foundation's mission and maintaining its core focus on providing a free and open encyclopedia.</p>

<p>The article further notes that Martin's letter has resonated with many Wikipedia editors and community members who share his concerns. It has sparked discussions about the WMF's governance, transparency, and accountability. Some community members have called for greater involvement in decision-making processes and a more critical evaluation of the WMF's spending priorities.</p>

<p>The Washington Post article does not take a definitive position on the merits of Martin's criticisms or the WMF's responses, but it presents the issue as a significant point of contention within the Wikipedia community. It suggests that the debate over the WMF's spending and priorities is likely to continue and could have important implications for the future of Wikipedia.</p>
