<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>The article "This Map Is Not Upside Down" on Maps.com discusses the conventional orientation of maps, particularly the common practice of placing north at the top. It challenges the notion that this is the only "correct" way to orient a map and explores the historical and cultural influences that have led to this convention. The article explains that for centuries, maps have been drawn with different orientations, reflecting the priorities and worldviews of the mapmakers and their societies. The north-up convention became more standardized with the advent of modern navigation and cartography, but it is not inherently superior or more accurate than other orientations. The author suggests that seeing maps with different orientations can challenge our assumptions and provide new perspectives on the world. Specifically, the article highlights the McArthur's Universal Corrective Map of the World which places the South Pole at the top, arguing that there is no objective reason why the Northern Hemisphere should always be seen as "above" the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
