  <h2>Summary of "The Story Behind Caesar Salad"</h2>
  <p>
    The National Geographic article "The Story Behind Caesar Salad" explores the origins of the popular salad, tracing its creation back to Caesar Cardini, an Italian immigrant who ran a restaurant in Tijuana, Mexico. The commonly accepted story is that in 1924, a busy weekend depleted the kitchen's supplies, and Cardini improvised a salad using what was available: romaine lettuce, croutons, Parmesan cheese, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, olive oil, and lime juice.

    The article highlights that while the exact details are debated, the Cardini family maintains that Caesar himself created the original recipe. His daughter, Rosa Cardini, is credited with preserving and promoting the salad's legacy. Other accounts suggest that one of Cardini's employees, Livio Santini, or his brother, Alex Cardini, may have played a role in the salad's invention or popularization.
