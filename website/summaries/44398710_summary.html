    <h2>US Supreme Court limits federal judges&#39; power to block Trump orders</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
Donald Trump has stated that he is seriously considering challenging birthright citizenship, which is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. This amendment grants citizenship to anyone born in the United States. Trump's renewed interest in this issue comes as he seeks to energize his base with hardline immigration policies during his presidential campaign.
</p>
<p>
During an interview, Trump said that he believes birthright citizenship is "frankly ridiculous" and that it is "going to end." He claimed that his administration had already prepared documents to challenge the practice during his first term but did not specify why the challenge was not pursued at that time.

Legal scholars widely disagree with Trump's interpretation of the 14th Amendment. The amendment, ratified in 1868, states that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens." This clause was primarily intended to grant citizenship to formerly enslaved people after the Civil War. Over the years, the Supreme Court has consistently upheld birthright citizenship, with the most notable case being United States v. Wong Kim Ark in 1898, which affirmed that children born in the U.S. to immigrant parents are citizens, provided they are subject to U.S. jurisdiction.

Challenging birthright citizenship would likely involve a complex legal battle, potentially reaching the Supreme Court. Some legal experts argue that the Supreme Court's current conservative majority might be open to re-examining the issue, given the court's recent willingness to overturn long-standing precedents. However, others believe that overturning birthright citizenship would require a constitutional amendment, which is a difficult and lengthy process.
</p>
<p>
Critics argue that Trump's stance is not only legally dubious but also politically divisive. They contend that it could lead to discrimination and create a subclass of people living in the U.S. without the full rights and protections of citizenship. Supporters of birthright citizenship view it as a fundamental principle of American democracy, ensuring equal rights and opportunities for all individuals born within the country's borders.

<p>
Trump's focus on this issue is seen as a strategic move to appeal to his base and draw attention to his hardline immigration policies, which have been a central theme throughout his political career.
