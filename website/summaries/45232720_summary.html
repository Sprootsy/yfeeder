<p>The article reports on a Google AI scientist who claims that Google's Gemini AI model has demonstrated general-purpose next-token prediction, suggesting it has acquired a world model and possesses genuine generalization skill. The scientist suggests that Gemini's ability to perform well on tasks it wasn't specifically trained for indicates a significant step towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). The scientist posted on a social media site that, in his opinion, Gemini had attained a level of generalisation that was very promising for the future of AI development. </p>
