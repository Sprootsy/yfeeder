<p><b>Summary:</b></p>
<p>According to AccuWeather, the United States is currently monitoring 14 potential rabies outbreaks across 20 states. Rabies, a viral disease affecting the central nervous system, is primarily transmitted through the bite or scratch of an infected animal. While rabies is almost always fatal if left untreated, it is preventable with prompt medical attention, including a series of vaccinations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasizes the importance of avoiding contact with wild animals, vaccinating pets, and seeking immediate medical care after any potential exposure. States included in the reported potential outbreaks are primarily located in the eastern and central parts of the US.</p>

<p>The article highlights that rabies can affect both domestic and wild animals, but certain species like bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes are more commonly associated with the disease. It details that transmission typically occurs through saliva entering the body via a bite or scratch, although rare instances of airborne transmission have been reported, primarily in cave environments with high bat populations. Symptoms of rabies can vary but often include behavioral changes, paralysis, and aggression. The incubation period, the time between exposure and the onset of symptoms, can range from weeks to months.</p>

<p>The article stresses the importance of preventative measures such as vaccinating pets, including dogs, cats, and ferrets, against rabies. It also advises against approaching or handling wild animals, even if they appear sick or injured. The CDC recommends washing any wound from an animal bite or scratch thoroughly with soap and water and seeking immediate medical attention. If exposure to rabies is suspected, a series of rabies vaccinations, known as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), can prevent the virus from causing illness. PEP is highly effective when administered promptly after exposure. The US tracks rabies cases in animals, and has seen fluctuations in reported cases over time. While human cases are rare in the US, they are almost always fatal without treatment.</p>
