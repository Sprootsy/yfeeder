  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
   The article "The Webb Medium-Deep Fields: Survey Design" (Casey et al., 2024) outlines the design and planned execution of the Webb Medium-Deep Fields (WMDF), a Cycle 2 James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) program. The WMDF aims to obtain deep, multi-band near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) imaging and NIR spectroscopic data over a significant cosmic volume to address several key questions in galaxy evolution and cosmology.
  </p>
  <p>
   The survey targets two well-studied extragalactic fields: the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) and COSMOS.  These fields have extensive multi-wavelength data from previous observatories, including Hubble, Spitzer, and ground-based telescopes, making them ideal for follow-up studies and comparisons with existing data. The WMDF's observations with JWST's NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec instruments are designed to provide unprecedented views of galaxy populations out to high redshifts.
  </p>
  <p>
   The survey's primary goals include: 1) characterizing the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) to far-infrared (FIR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 8 to understand their stellar populations, dust content, and star formation histories; 2) identifying and studying the properties of faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their role in galaxy evolution; 3) measuring the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and the star-forming main sequence over cosmic time; and 4) exploring the morphology and structural properties of galaxies at high redshifts. The survey is also designed to discover rare and unusual objects, such as high-redshift quasars and strongly lensed galaxies.
  </p>
  <p>
   The WMDF utilizes a combination of NIRCam imaging in multiple filters to measure photometric redshifts and stellar masses, MIRI imaging to probe rest-frame optical and near-infrared emission from dust, and NIRSpec multi-object spectroscopy to obtain redshifts and probe the physical conditions of galaxies. The survey strategy involves tiling the target fields with overlapping NIRCam and MIRI pointings to achieve uniform depth and coverage. The NIRSpec observations are designed to target a representative sample of galaxies selected based on their photometric properties.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article details the specific observing modes, filters, exposure times, and tiling patterns for each instrument. It also discusses the data reduction and calibration procedures that will be used to ensure the quality and accuracy of the final data products. The WMDF data will be publicly released, allowing the broader astronomical community to use the data for their own research projects.
  </p>
  <p>
   In summary, the Webb Medium-Deep Fields is a comprehensive JWST survey designed to provide a wealth of data for studying galaxy evolution and cosmology. By targeting well-studied fields and employing a multi-faceted observational strategy, the WMDF will enable significant advances in our understanding of the universe.
