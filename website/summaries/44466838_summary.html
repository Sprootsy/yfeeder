<h3>Summary</h3>
A new study led by researchers at the University of California San Diego suggests that air pollution may contribute to the development of lung cancer in individuals who have never smoked. The study, published in *Nature*, examines how inhaled particulate matter (PM2.5) can promote lung cancer development in never-smokers who possess EGFR mutations. The research team analyzed data from over 400,000 individuals in England, South Korea, and Canada, noting a correlation between increased PM2.5 exposure and higher rates of EGFR-mutated lung cancer.

The study also found that air pollution exposure can cause inflammation, which contributes to the development of cancer. Specifically, PM2.5 triggers the influx of macrophages, immune cells that release inflammatory mediators such as oncostatin M (OSM). OSM, in turn, activates EGFR, leading to the proliferation of lung cells with EGFR mutations. The study further highlights the role of APOE, a protein involved in cholesterol metabolism, which is also implicated in this process.

Furthermore, experiments using laboratory mice revealed that exposure to air pollution exacerbated lung cancer development in mice with EGFR mutations. These findings offer insights into the potential mechanisms by which air pollution might lead to lung cancer in people who have never smoked.
<br></br>
The researchers suggest that these findings have implications for cancer prevention and treatment strategies. Targeting the inflammatory pathways activated by air pollution, such as the OSM-EGFR signaling axis, might offer new avenues for preventing or treating lung cancer in never-smokers exposed to air pollution.
