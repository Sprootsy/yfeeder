  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
   The Supreme Court has been formally asked to overturn its landmark 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. A group called the Stop Overturning Our Democracy (STOOD) filed a petition arguing that the Obergefell decision was wrongly decided and infringes on the rights of states to define marriage. The petition comes in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which has emboldened some conservatives to pursue other legal challenges to established precedents.

  <p>
   The petition argues that Obergefell violates the Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states. STOOD claims that the definition of marriage should be left to individual states to decide based on the will of their citizens. They also argue that the Obergefell decision undermines religious freedom by forcing individuals and institutions to recognize and support same-sex marriage, even if it conflicts with their beliefs. The group further claims that the decision has led to a decline in traditional family values and harms children.

   Legal experts believe that the Supreme Court is unlikely to take up this case. To take up a case, four justices must agree to hear it. Given the current composition of the court, with several justices who have publicly supported LGBTQ+ rights, it is considered improbable that four justices would vote to revisit Obergefell.

   The petition is viewed as a long shot but highlights the ongoing efforts by some conservative groups to challenge LGBTQ+ rights in the United States. The issue of same-sex marriage remains a politically charged topic, and this petition reflects the deep divisions within the country regarding the role of government in regulating marriage and family.
