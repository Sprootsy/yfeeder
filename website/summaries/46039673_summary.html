  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The xkcd comic #3172 is a humorous flowchart titled "How to tell if you're really dating." It uses a series of nested questions and branching paths to determine the level of commitment in a relationship, ultimately leading to different conclusions about whether the individuals are "really dating" or not. The comic presents a lighthearted, albeit slightly cynical, take on the complexities and ambiguities of modern dating. It playfully explores the common anxieties and insecurities people face when trying to define the nature and seriousness of their romantic relationships.</p>
  <p>The flowchart begins with the initial question: "Are you dating someone?" If the answer is "No," the comic suggests getting off the computer. If the answer is "Yes," the flowchart proceeds to more specific questions. These questions revolve around key milestones and relationship markers. One question is: "Have you met their parents?" A "No" answer leads to the question: "Have you MET ANY of their friends?" with a double emphasis on the word "any". If the answer to this is still "No," the flowchart branches into a loop, presenting options like "They're too ashamed to show you off" or "You're just not a priority." and ultimately circling back to the question of meeting friends again. If the answer is "Yes," (you have met their friends), the path leads back to the "Have you met their parents?" question, or the flowchart may determine you aren't really dating. </p>
  <p>Other questions in the flowchart include considerations of sexual intimacy, time spent together, and whether they've seen you "at your worst." If you have not seen each other at your worst, the comic asks, "Do you LIKE each other at your worst?" If you don't like each other at your worst, the comic suggests "Break up!" A "yes" answer leads the chart to the question: "Have you had awkward sex?" If the answer to that question is no, it leads to "You're not really dating". A yes leads to "You're dating". The comic highlights that experiencing each other's less-than-perfect sides is essential for a genuine romantic connection.</p>
  <p>The overall tone of the comic is humorous and relatable, poking fun at the often-overanalyzed and sometimes irrational nature of dating. The comic's conclusion isn't a definitive answer but rather a playful commentary on the subjective and personal nature of relationships. Whether or not someone is "really dating" ultimately depends on their own interpretation and expectations.</p>
