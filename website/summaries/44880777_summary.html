    Ferdinand Mount's article "Biff Bang" in the <em>London Review of Books</em> delves into the career and significance of P.G. Wodehouse, particularly focusing on the interwar period when Wodehouse achieved peak fame and influence. The essay explores the complexities behind Wodehouse's seemingly frivolous and light-hearted writing, examining the societal context that made his work so popular and enduring.

    Mount analyzes Wodehouse's unique style, characterized by witty dialogue, intricate plots involving mistaken identities and farcical situations, and a cast of memorable characters such as Bertie Wooster and Jeeves. He argues that Wodehouse's genius lies in his ability to create a self-contained, escapist world that both reflected and subtly critiqued the values of the British upper class. The article examines how Wodehouse's focus on trivial matters and his avoidance of serious social or political commentary contributed to his appeal, offering a form of entertainment that was deliberately detached from the anxieties of the time.

    The essay considers the impact of World War I on Wodehouse's work, suggesting that the war's horrors may have indirectly influenced his decision to retreat into a world of comedic absurdity. Mount also touches on the critical reception of Wodehouse's novels and stories, noting how some critics dismissed his work as mere fluff while others recognized its underlying sophistication and skill. He contrasts Wodehouse's approach to comedy with that of other contemporary writers, highlighting his distinctive voice and his lasting influence on the genre.

    Mount also addresses the controversial period of Wodehouse's life during World War II, when he made radio broadcasts from Germany, which led to accusations of collaboration and damaged his reputation in Britain. The article examines the circumstances surrounding these broadcasts and explores the various interpretations of Wodehouse's motives, including naiveté, a desire to entertain, and a lack of political awareness. Mount ultimately suggests that Wodehouse's actions were more a result of his apolitical nature and his detachment from the realities of the war than a deliberate act of betrayal.

    The essay concludes by reaffirming Wodehouse's status as a major comic writer, emphasizing the enduring appeal of his work and the artistry behind his seemingly effortless prose. Mount argues that Wodehouse's ability to create a world of perpetual amusement, populated by lovable eccentrics and absurd situations, continues to resonate with readers today.
