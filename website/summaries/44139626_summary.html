The article delves into the equipment, methods, and artistic vision behind Lia's work, offering insights into this niche genre of photography.</p>

<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Subject Matter:</b> Lia Booth photographs the interiors of musical instruments, offering viewers a rarely seen perspective.</li>
<li><b>Probe Lenses:</b> She uses probe lenses, which are long, thin lenses with a wide depth of field at close distances, to navigate and photograph the confined spaces inside instruments.</li>
<li><b>Focus Stacking:</b> Due to the shallow depth of field even with probe lenses, Lia employs focus stacking. This involves taking multiple images at different focus points and merging them in post-processing to achieve complete sharpness throughout the image.</li>
<li><b>Lighting:</b> Lia uses continuous LED lighting to illuminate the interiors of the instruments, carefully controlling the light to highlight textures and details.</li>
<li><b>Equipment:</b> She uses a Laowa probe lens, a Nikon Z7 camera, and continuous LED lights. A macro rail is also used for precise focus adjustments during focus stacking.</li>
<li><b>Process:</b> The process involves carefully positioning the probe lens within the instrument, taking numerous shots with incremental focus adjustments, and then using software like Helicon Focus or Adobe Photoshop to combine the images.</li>
<li><b>Artistic Vision:</b> Lia aims to create abstract and surreal images, highlighting the intricate craftsmanship and hidden beauty within the instruments. The final images often resemble landscapes or otherworldly scenes.</li>
<li><b>Challenges:</b> Photographing inside instruments presents challenges such as limited space, controlling reflections, and managing dust.</li>
<li><b>Inspiration:</b> Lia's background in music and her interest in visual arts led her to combine these passions through this unique photographic approach.</li>
<li><b>Impact:</b> Lia's work offers a new way of appreciating musical instruments beyond their auditory function, revealing their visual complexity and artistic value.</li>
