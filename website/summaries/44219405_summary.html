  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The article "Why Android Can't Use CDC Ethernet" by jordemort.dev discusses the challenges and limitations of using CDC (Communication Device Class) Ethernet connections on Android devices. It explains that while CDC Ethernet is a standardized protocol for network communication over USB, its implementation and support on Android are inconsistent and problematic. The author details the historical context, starting with Android's initial focus on tethering rather than acting as a full-fledged Ethernet host. This led to a fragmented ecosystem where different Android versions and device manufacturers have varying levels of CDC Ethernet support, resulting in a lack of a unified and reliable experience.</p>
  <p>The article explores the technical hurdles that contribute to these issues. It explains the need for specific kernel drivers and user-space configurations to enable CDC Ethernet. These drivers are often missing or outdated on many Android devices, and the necessary configurations are not automatically applied, requiring manual intervention. Furthermore, the author highlights the power management challenges associated with USB Ethernet adapters. Android's aggressive power-saving features can interfere with the stability and performance of CDC Ethernet connections, causing frequent disconnects and unreliable network access.</p>
  <p>The author also touches upon the security implications of using CDC Ethernet on Android. Because CDC Ethernet connections are often treated as trusted network interfaces, they can potentially bypass security measures and expose the device to vulnerabilities if not properly configured. This is a concern in enterprise environments where security is paramount.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, the article explains that while CDC Ethernet offers a convenient way to connect Android devices to wired networks, the lack of consistent support, technical complexities, power management issues, and potential security risks make it a less-than-ideal solution. The author suggests exploring alternative approaches, such as using dedicated Ethernet adapters with custom drivers or relying on Wi-Fi connections, to achieve more reliable and secure network connectivity on Android devices. The article emphasizes that the current state of CDC Ethernet support on Android is a result of historical design choices, fragmentation within the Android ecosystem, and the inherent challenges of USB-based network communication.</p>
