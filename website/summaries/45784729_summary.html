  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The article, titled "WiFi 7 Speed Hunt," documents the author's exploration of WiFi 7 technology, focusing on achieving maximum speeds and understanding its nuances. The author details their hands-on experience setting up and testing a WiFi 7 network, including the hardware used (a WiFi 7 router and client devices), the configuration process, and the performance results obtained under various conditions.</p>
  <p>The author starts by outlining the theoretical advantages of WiFi 7, such as wider channels (up to 320 MHz), 4096-QAM modulation, and Multi-Link Operation (MLO). They then describe the process of selecting and purchasing WiFi 7 compatible hardware. This involved finding a suitable router and client devices (laptops with compatible WiFi cards or USB adapters) and ensuring that the components work well together.</p>
  <p>The setup process is described, covering aspects like router configuration, firmware updates, and driver installations for the client devices. The author then presents a series of speed tests conducted using tools like iperf3 to measure throughput under different scenarios. These scenarios include varying distances between the router and client, different channel widths, and single vs. multiple link operation.</p>
  <p>The article presents a progression of speed tests and the tweaking of settings to get the best performance. The results of the tests are presented, including the speeds achieved, the latency observed, and the stability of the connection. The author encountered several challenges during the testing process, such as compatibility issues between devices, unexpected performance bottlenecks, and the need to fine-tune settings to optimize performance. The author explains the impact of different configurations and settings, such as channel width, security protocols, and driver versions, on the overall performance of the WiFi 7 network.</p>
  <p>Throughout the article, the author highlights the practical considerations of implementing WiFi 7, noting that real-world performance can differ significantly from theoretical maximums. The author shares their observations and insights gained from the hands-on experience, offering advice to others looking to experiment with WiFi 7 technology. The conclusion summarizes the key findings, emphasizing the potential of WiFi 7 while also acknowledging the challenges and limitations of the technology in its current state. The author also suggests future areas for exploration and experimentation.</p>
