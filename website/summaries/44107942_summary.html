  <p>This is a blog post by Scott Aaronson discussing a mathematical problem he calls "Square Theory." The post explores the question of whether, given a large number of randomly chosen points in a high-dimensional space, one can always find a subset of these points that form the vertices of a square (or a near-square). Aaronson traces the problem's origins back to a conversation with Greg Kuperberg, who was curious about whether sufficiently many random points in a high-dimensional space must contain the vertices of a regular simplex.</p>

  <p>The core question revolves around what happens as the number of points increases relative to the dimensionality of the space. If you have very few points compared to the dimensions, it's unlikely to find a square. Conversely, if you have exponentially many points compared to the dimensions, you might expect that squares should exist. The problem's difficulty lies in the intermediate range, where the number of points grows polynomially with the dimensionality.</p>

  <p>Aaronson discusses various approaches to tackling the problem, including probabilistic arguments and connections to other mathematical areas such as Ramsey theory and discrepancy theory. The probabilistic arguments involve calculating the expected number of squares and trying to show that this number is greater than zero with high probability. However, these arguments often run into technical difficulties. He also explores the idea of using spectral methods and considering the eigenvalues of certain matrices related to the point configurations.</p>

  <p>The post highlights the challenges in determining whether a square must exist and emphasizes the lack of a definitive answer. It's presented as an open problem, potentially related to other unsolved problems in combinatorics and discrete geometry. Furthermore, the post considers generalizations of the "square" problem to other geometric shapes and discusses potential avenues for further research. Several commenters on the blog post discuss related ideas and potential proof strategies, contributing to a collaborative exploration of the problem.</p>

  <p>One key aspect is the relationship to finding approximate squares, where the vertices don't need to form a perfect square but can deviate slightly. This relaxation of the problem might make it more tractable. The blog post also touches upon the algorithmic complexity of finding squares (or approximate squares) in a given set of points. It's suggested that even if the existence of a square could be proven, finding such a square algorithmically might be computationally hard.</p>

  <p>The discussion includes parallels to the problem of finding other geometric configurations within random point sets, such as lines or triangles. The post underlines the general question of understanding the emergence of structure in high-dimensional random data and its connections to various fields like machine learning and theoretical computer science. Ultimately, the blog post serves as an exposition of an intriguing mathematical puzzle, inviting further investigation and discussion.</p>
