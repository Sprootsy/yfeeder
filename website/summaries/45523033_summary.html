    <h2>California enacts law enabling people to universally opt out of data sharing</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <h3>Summary:</h3>
  <p>California has enacted a new law, AB 41, which mandates that businesses respect users' privacy preferences expressed through opt-out signals in web browsers or other mechanisms. This law amends the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). The bill requires companies to recognize Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals or similar mechanisms as valid requests to opt-out of the sale or sharing of a consumer's personal information. The law aims to streamline the process for consumers to exercise their privacy rights by allowing them to set their preferences once in their browser instead of having to manage privacy settings on each individual website. </p>
  <p>The law specifies that if a business receives an opt-out preference signal, it must treat it as a valid request to opt-out of the sale or sharing of the consumer's personal information under the CCPA and CPRA. The law also places the responsibility on the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) to adopt regulations further detailing the technical specifications for these opt-out signals. The CPPA is also tasked with determining how frequently a business must check for updates to a consumer's opt-out preference signal. The law provides some exceptions, such as when a consumer knowingly provides their personal information for a specific purpose, or when complying with the opt-out signal would conflict with other legal obligations.</p>
  <p>AB 41 reflects a broader trend toward empowering consumers with greater control over their data privacy and simplifying the process for exercising their rights under privacy laws. It is anticipated to reduce the burden on consumers to individually manage their privacy settings on every website they visit. By requiring businesses to honor universal opt-out signals, the law aims to create a more seamless and user-friendly experience for consumers seeking to protect their personal information. The law is set to take effect on January 1, 2026, providing businesses with time to implement the necessary technical adjustments to comply.</p>
