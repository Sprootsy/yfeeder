<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The article discusses a controversy surrounding Wikipedia's handling of the term "genocide" in relation to the Israel-Gaza conflict. The dispute centers on whether the Wikipedia page should explicitly state that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. This has led to significant debate and editing disputes among Wikipedia contributors.
</p>
<p>
The controversy escalated to the point where Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales intervened. Wales emphasized the need for neutrality and adherence to Wikipedia's policies, which require claims to be supported by reliable sources and presented without bias. He cautioned against using Wikipedia to push a particular political agenda or narrative.
</p>
<p>
The core of the disagreement lies in differing interpretations of international law and the definition of genocide, as well as varying perspectives on the actions of Israel in Gaza. Some editors argue that the scale and nature of the violence, coupled with statements made by Israeli officials, meet the criteria for genocide under the Genocide Convention. Others contend that while the situation is undoubtedly dire and involves significant loss of life, it does not meet the strict legal definition of genocide, and that accusations of genocide are politically motivated.
</p>
<p>
The debate also involves the reliability and neutrality of sources. Some editors challenge the credibility of sources cited to support the genocide claim, while others argue that these sources are reputable and provide compelling evidence. This issue reflects broader debates about media bias and the challenges of reporting on conflicts in a fair and accurate manner.

The article highlights the difficulties Wikipedia faces in maintaining neutrality and objectivity on contentious topics, particularly those involving international conflicts and accusations of human rights violations. The conflict underscores the importance of rigorous fact-checking, balanced presentation of information, and adherence to Wikipedia's core principles. It also brings attention to the role of Wikipedia as a source of information for millions of people and the responsibility of its editors to ensure accuracy and impartiality.
