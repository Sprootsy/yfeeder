   According to a Bloomberg article published on June 26, 2025, Philadelphia's transit system, SEPTA, voted to cut service by 45% and increase fares. The drastic measures are attributed to a budget crisis stemming from a decline in ridership and insufficient government funding. The cuts will impact bus, subway, and trolley lines, leading to longer wait times and reduced accessibility, particularly affecting low-income communities that rely heavily on public transportation. The fare hikes will further burden riders, potentially exacerbating the decline in ridership.

   SEPTA officials claim that the cuts and fare increases are necessary to prevent the system from collapsing entirely. They argue that without additional funding from the state and federal governments, these measures are the only way to ensure the system's long-term survival, albeit in a significantly reduced form. The article notes that the situation in Philadelphia reflects a broader trend of financial difficulties facing public transit systems across the United States, many of which are struggling to recover from the pandemic-induced drop in ridership and are facing increasing operating costs. The article also mentions that the cuts are expected to have a significant impact on the city's economy, making it more difficult for people to get to work and access essential services. Local community groups and labor unions have voiced strong opposition to the cuts, arguing that they will disproportionately harm vulnerable populations and undermine the city's efforts to promote economic equity.
