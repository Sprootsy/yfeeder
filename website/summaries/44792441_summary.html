  <p>The article on amritkwatra.com details an experiment involving the creation of 3D line drawings using three.js, a JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in a web browser. The author explores different techniques to make 2D line drawings appear three-dimensional. They begin with simple lines in 3D space, then gradually introduce more complex elements such as stroke weight variation, vertex displacement, and color gradients to simulate depth and volume.</p>

  <p>The author initially focuses on creating basic 3D lines but finds them lacking in depth. To address this, they experiment with varying the thickness of the lines, making closer lines thicker and more distant lines thinner. This technique helps to simulate perspective and provides a sense of depth. They also use vertex displacement to subtly move the vertices of the lines, which adds visual interest and makes the lines appear less uniform and more organic.</p>

  <p>Color gradients are another technique employed to enhance the 3D effect. The author uses darker colors for parts of the lines that are meant to be perceived as further away and lighter colors for closer parts. This creates a visual cue that reinforces the illusion of depth. Additionally, they explore the use of different line materials and shaders within three.js to achieve various visual effects, such as glowing or textured lines.</p>

  <p>The article also touches on the computational challenges of rendering many lines in 3D. The author discusses optimization techniques to improve performance, such as reducing the number of vertices and using efficient rendering methods provided by three.js. The experiment involves a process of iterative refinement, where the author adjusts parameters and explores different visual styles to achieve the desired aesthetic.</p>

  <p>Finally, the article showcases a series of visually appealing 3D line drawings that demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques used. These drawings feature intricate patterns and complex structures that appear to have depth and volume despite being composed of simple lines. The author reflects on the process and shares insights gained from the experiment, highlighting the potential of using creative coding to generate unique and visually engaging 3D art.</p>
