<p>Olimex has announced the temporary suspension of shipments to the USA due to increased scrutiny and packages being held by US customs. The company cites two primary reasons for this action: Firstly, the increased customs control leads to delays and difficulties in receiving payments for orders. Secondly, new regulations and interpretations by US customs officials have created challenges in properly declaring the contents of packages, particularly concerning electronic components. Olimex expresses regret for this situation, especially affecting their US customers who rely on their products. The company is actively working to resolve the issues by seeking clarification on the new regulations and finding solutions to comply with US customs requirements. They hope to resume shipments to the USA as soon as possible, but cannot provide a definite timeline. In the meantime, US customers are advised to explore alternative suppliers or distributors within the USA. Olimex emphasizes their commitment to serving their US customers and apologizes for any inconvenience caused by this temporary suspension.</p>
