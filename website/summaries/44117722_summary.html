    <h2>Compiler Explorer and the promise of URLs that last forever</h2>

    The article discusses the importance of stable URLs for Compiler Explorer, a tool that allows users to interactively compile and examine code. The author emphasizes that Compiler Explorer's value is significantly enhanced by its ability to be easily shared and referenced through URLs. These URLs act as permanent links that encapsulate a specific code snippet, compiler configuration, and compilation output.

    The author highlights that the persistence of Compiler Explorer URLs is not merely a convenience but a crucial aspect of the tool's utility in various contexts: documentation, question answering, bug reporting, and reproducibility. A stable URL ensures that a reference to a specific code example within a blog post, a Stack Overflow answer, or a bug report will remain valid over time, preventing link rot and preserving the context for future readers.

    The article explains how Compiler Explorer achieves URL stability by storing the complete state of the editor in the URL itself. The query string encodes information such as the source code, compiler flags, compiler version, and any other relevant settings. This self-contained nature eliminates the need for server-side storage of individual configurations, which simplifies the architecture and enhances scalability. It also means that the information to compile and display the code is available as long as the Compiler Explorer website exists.

    The author acknowledges the limitations of this approach, particularly the maximum length of URLs imposed by browsers and web servers. Longer code snippets or more complex configurations can lead to URLs exceeding these limits. However, the author argues that the benefits of URL stability outweigh the drawbacks.

    The piece also implicitly addresses the challenges of maintaining a complex online tool like Compiler Explorer over the long term. By prioritizing URL stability, the project commits to preserving the functionality associated with those URLs, which requires careful consideration of backward compatibility and infrastructure maintenance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, the article suggests that the concept of persistent URLs could be applied to other online tools and platforms, enhancing their usability and longevity. The author advocates for a design philosophy that values the ability to share and reference specific states of interactive tools, thereby fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.
