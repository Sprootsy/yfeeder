    <h2>Amazon must face US nationwide class action over third-party sales</h2>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>A U.S. appeals court has revived a nationwide class action lawsuit against Amazon, alleging the e-commerce giant is liable for defective products sold by third-party vendors on its platform. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court's decision, stating that Amazon could be held responsible for damages caused by faulty goods sold by third-party sellers. The lawsuit, initially filed in 2016, centers on claims from consumers who were injured by defective products purchased through Amazon's marketplace.</p>
<p>The court's ruling hinged on the interpretation of state law concerning product liability. The panel determined that Amazon's involvement in the sales process, including handling transactions, controlling the marketplace, and exerting influence over sellers, could establish it as a "seller" under state law. This designation would make Amazon subject to the same liability standards as traditional retailers.</p>
<p>Amazon has argued that it merely provides a platform for sellers and should not be held liable for their products. However, the plaintiffs contend that Amazon profits from these sales and exerts considerable control over the third-party vendors, therefore bearing responsibility for ensuring product safety.</p>
<p>The case will now return to the lower court for further proceedings. The outcome could have significant implications for Amazon and other online marketplaces, potentially reshaping their liability exposure for products sold by third-party vendors. The decision highlights the ongoing debate about the responsibility of online platforms for the safety and quality of goods sold through their services.</p>
