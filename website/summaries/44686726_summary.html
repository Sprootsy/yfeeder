<h2>Summary:</h2>
The article discusses the concept of "sub-agents" within the context of Anthropic's Claude, describing how they can be used to enhance the model's ability to handle complex tasks. Sub-agents are specialized modules designed to focus on specific aspects of a larger problem, allowing Claude to decompose complex prompts into smaller, more manageable units. This approach aims to improve Claude's performance on tasks that require a combination of different skills or knowledge domains.

The document explains that sub-agents are implemented as separate prompts or functions that are called by a main agent (Claude) to perform specific sub-tasks. The main agent acts as a coordinator, delegating tasks to the appropriate sub-agents and integrating their outputs to produce a final result. This modular design allows for easier debugging, maintenance, and improvement of individual components.

The article describes different methods for creating and using sub-agents. One approach involves using prompt engineering to define the roles and responsibilities of each sub-agent. Another involves using tools or functions that Claude can call to perform specific tasks.

The document presents example use cases of sub-agents, such as question answering, summarization, and code generation. In question answering, sub-agents might be used to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base, extract key facts, and synthesize an answer. In summarization, sub-agents might be used to identify the main topics, extract supporting details, and generate a concise summary. In code generation, sub-agents can handle tasks like understanding user requirements, designing software architecture, and writing code in a specific programming language.

The article also touches on the importance of designing effective communication protocols between the main agent and its sub-agents. This includes defining clear input and output formats, as well as mechanisms for handling errors and exceptions.

Overall, the article presents sub-agents as a powerful technique for improving the performance and reliability of large language models like Claude on complex tasks. By decomposing problems into smaller, more manageable units, sub-agents enable Claude to leverage its strengths in specific areas and produce more accurate and comprehensive results.
