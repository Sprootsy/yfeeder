   <h3>Summary:</h3>
   <p>
    Troy Hunt announces the release of Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) 2.0, a complete rewrite of the popular data breach notification website. The original HIBP, created in 2013, had become difficult to maintain and scale due to its age and technical debt. HIBP 2.0 is designed for improved performance, maintainability, and scalability, laying the foundation for future features and growth.
   </p>
   <p>
    The rewrite involved migrating the entire codebase from its original structure to a more modern and efficient architecture. The underlying data store was migrated from Azure Search to Azure Cosmos DB, which offers better performance for the types of queries HIBP uses. The front-end has been updated to a more modern framework, and the API has been redesigned for improved efficiency.
   </p>
   <p>
    One of the motivations for the rewrite was to handle the increasing volume of data breaches and the growing number of users relying on HIBP. The new architecture is better equipped to handle large datasets and high traffic loads.

    The author emphasizes that HIBP 2.0 maintains the core functionality of the original site, including email and domain searches, password breach checks, and the ability to subscribe to notifications for breached accounts. Users should not notice any significant changes in the user interface or functionality.

    The article also touches upon the challenges involved in migrating such a large and critical system. Hunt highlights the importance of thorough testing and monitoring to ensure a smooth transition and minimize disruption for users.

   <p>
    The launch of HIBP 2.0 represents a significant investment in the future of the service, ensuring that it can continue to provide valuable data breach information to the public for years to come. The new architecture will enable Hunt and his team to add new features and improvements more easily, further enhancing the utility of HIBP.
