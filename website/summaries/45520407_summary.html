<p>According to a report on 404 Media, Apple has internally classified "ICE" (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) as a protected class within its App Store guidelines, preventing discriminatory apps targeting the agency. This policy came to light after Apple rejected an app called "ALLEGEDLY: Fake ICE App," designed to satirize ICE by allowing users to generate fake arrest warrants and deportation orders with the names of their friends and family. Apple cited guideline 1.1, which prohibits content that is discriminatory, insensitive, bullying, or abusive towards a specific individual or group, explicitly stating that ICE is considered a protected class under these guidelines. The app developer, Brian Davis, argued that the app was intended as satire and political commentary, akin to other apps that mock political figures or groups. However, Apple stood by its decision, asserting that the app violated its policies against content targeting protected classes. This revelation sparked debate about the scope of Apple's protected class designations and whether a government agency like ICE should be included, particularly given the agency's controversial history and policies.</p>
