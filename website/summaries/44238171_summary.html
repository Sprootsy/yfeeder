<p>Summary: The article is an obituary for the renowned mathematician John Horton Conway, who died on April 11, 2020, at the age of 82, due to complications from COVID-19. It details his extraordinary life and contributions to various fields of mathematics, as well as his unique personality and playful approach to the subject. Conway, born in Liverpool, England, displayed exceptional mathematical talent from a young age and pursued his studies at Cambridge University. He made significant advancements in diverse areas such as group theory, knot theory, number theory, game theory, and coding theory. He is most famous for inventing the Game of Life, a zero-player game that simulates the evolution of a cellular automaton and has captivated mathematicians, computer scientists, and enthusiasts alike for its emergent complexity and philosophical implications.

Beyond his formal mathematical achievements, Conway was known for his infectious enthusiasm, remarkable ability to perform complex calculations mentally, and his engaging lectures and demonstrations. He had a knack for explaining difficult mathematical concepts in an accessible and entertaining manner, often using everyday objects and playful examples. He was a showman and performer who used his mathematical skills to entertain and educate. His work was driven by curiosity and a deep understanding of the underlying patterns and structures that govern the mathematical world.

The article highlights some of Conway's other notable contributions, including his work on surreal numbers, which expanded the concept of numbers beyond real and complex numbers, and his discovery of the Leech lattice, a highly symmetrical structure in 24-dimensional space that has connections to coding theory and string theory. Conway also made significant contributions to recreational mathematics, inventing new games, puzzles, and notations, such as the Doomsday algorithm for calculating the day of the week for any given date. He worked at Cambridge University and later at Princeton University where he was a professor until his death. He mentored many students and influenced a generation of mathematicians.

Conway's death is mourned by the mathematical community and beyond. The article portrays him as a brilliant, unconventional, and deeply influential figure who left an indelible mark on the world of mathematics and inspired countless others with his passion and creativity.</p>
