<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>
The Hong Kong Consumer Council tested 29 sunscreen products, assessing their sun protection factor (SPF), UVA protection, and ingredient labeling. The test revealed that over 70% of the tested sunscreen products did not meet their labeled SPF claims. While the declared SPF values ranged from 30 to 50+, the actual SPF values were lower. Some sunscreens failed to provide adequate UVA protection, despite claiming broad-spectrum protection. Ingredient labeling discrepancies were also found in some products. The tests were conducted according to international standards. The Consumer Council recommends consumers to apply a sufficient amount of sunscreen, reapply every two hours or after swimming/sweating, and choose broad-spectrum sunscreens with both UVA and UVB protection. They also advise manufacturers to improve the accuracy of their SPF labeling and ingredient information.
