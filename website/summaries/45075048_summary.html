The article "Feel It" by Mitchell Hashimoto discusses the importance of experiencing the consequences of one's actions in software development, particularly in the context of infrastructure automation and DevOps. Hashimoto argues that developers and operators often become disconnected from the real-world impact of their code and configurations, leading to a lack of empathy and understanding of the problems they are solving. This disconnect can result in poorly designed systems, increased complexity, and ultimately, a negative impact on end-users.

Hashimoto introduces the concept of "feeling it," which means directly experiencing the pain and consequences of one's decisions. This can involve actively participating in on-call rotations, dealing with production incidents, and directly interacting with users. By feeling the pain, developers are better equipped to understand the true cost of their choices and are more motivated to create solutions that are robust, reliable, and user-friendly.

The article highlights several ways in which developers can become disconnected from the real-world impact of their work. One common issue is excessive abstraction, where layers of tooling and automation obscure the underlying reality of the systems they are managing. This can lead to a lack of understanding of how the system actually works, making it difficult to troubleshoot problems or make informed decisions. Another issue is specialization, where developers become focused on specific components or areas of the system, losing sight of the overall picture. This can lead to a lack of empathy for other teams and a failure to consider the impact of their changes on the system as a whole.

Hashimoto argues that feeling the pain is not just about fixing bugs or resolving incidents. It's about developing a deeper understanding of the system, the users, and the business goals. It's about building empathy for the people who are affected by the system, whether they are internal users or external customers. By feeling the pain, developers can become more effective problem solvers, more creative innovators, and more valuable members of the team.

The article suggests several practical steps that organizations can take to help developers feel the pain. These include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Encouraging developers to participate in on-call rotations, even if they are not directly responsible for production support.
</li>
<li>
Giving developers opportunities to interact directly with users and gather feedback.
</li>
<li>
Providing developers with access to production systems and data, so they can see the real-world impact of their changes.
</li>
<li>
Fostering a culture of blameless postmortems, where mistakes are seen as learning opportunities rather than causes for punishment.
</li>
<li>
Promoting cross-functional collaboration, so that developers can learn from other teams and understand the broader context of their work.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
By implementing these practices, organizations can help developers develop a deeper understanding of the systems they are building, the users they are serving, and the business goals they are trying to achieve. This, in turn, can lead to better software, more satisfied users, and a more successful organization. The article concludes that "feeling it" is not just a nice-to-have, but a critical ingredient for building successful software systems and fostering a healthy engineering culture.
