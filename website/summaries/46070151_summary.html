    <h2>Protect Public School Students from Surveillance of Off-Campus Speech</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the ACLU of Arizona filed a lawsuit in federal court to protect public school students in the Mesa Unified School District from unconstitutional surveillance. The lawsuit challenges the district's use of sophisticated AI-powered monitoring software on school-issued devices and the school network, arguing that it violates the students' Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures, as well as their First Amendment rights to free speech. The software monitors virtually all student online activity, including emails, chats, browsing history, and even private messages on social media platforms, both on and off school grounds. The lawsuit contends that the monitoring is overly broad, lacking reasonable suspicion, and creates a chilling effect on students' expression. The plaintiffs, a group of students and their parents, argue that the school district is collecting and storing vast amounts of private data about students’ lives, including their religious beliefs, political views, and personal struggles, without adequate safeguards or oversight. This data is then used to generate “alerts” based on algorithms that are often inaccurate or biased, potentially leading to unwarranted disciplinary action or interventions. The EFF and the ACLU of Arizona assert that the school district’s surveillance practices are disproportionate and harmful, infringing on students' privacy and freedom of expression. They seek to end the unconstitutional monitoring program and establish clear legal standards for the use of student surveillance technology in schools, emphasizing the need to balance student safety with the protection of fundamental rights.</p>
