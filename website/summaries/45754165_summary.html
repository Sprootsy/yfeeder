   <h3>Summary:</h3>
   <p>
    The article reports on the European Commission's concerns regarding Meta and TikTok's obstruction of researchers' access to data, which is deemed essential for enforcing the Digital Services Act (DSA). The DSA requires very large online platforms (VLOPs) and search engines to share data with vetted researchers to assess systemic risks, such as the spread of illegal content, disinformation, and the impact on mental health and electoral processes.

    According to the European Commission, both Meta and TikTok are creating obstacles that hinder researchers' ability to effectively scrutinize their platforms. These obstacles include denying access to specific data points, imposing unreasonable data access fees, and delaying the provision of data. The commission has formally opened proceedings to investigate whether Meta has breached the DSA by failing to provide adequate access to publicly available data and its internal data analysis tools. Similarly, the commission is scrutinizing TikTok for potential violations related to data access.

    Specifically, the commission is examining whether Meta is transparent about its recommender systems, which play a significant role in shaping the content users see. Concerns are also raised about Meta's archiving practices of publicly available content on Facebook and Instagram, as well as the accessibility of data for real-time risk detection. Regarding TikTok, the investigation focuses on the accessibility of data for researchers to assess potential risks associated with the platform's design and algorithms.

    Failure to comply with the DSA can result in substantial penalties, including fines of up to 6% of a platform's global annual revenue. The European Commission's actions underscore its commitment to ensuring that online platforms are accountable and transparent, and that researchers have the necessary tools to understand and address the systemic risks associated with these platforms. The investigations into Meta and TikTok represent a significant step in enforcing the DSA and promoting a safer online environment.
