   The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) released a report detailing the economic effects of tariffs imposed by the United States between 2018 and 2021. These tariffs, primarily initiated by the Trump administration, targeted goods from various countries, most notably China, and were often justified under national security grounds (Section 232) or in response to alleged unfair trade practices (Section 301). The ITC report aimed to quantify the impact of these tariffs on the U.S. economy, considering factors like GDP, employment, and prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   The report found that these tariffs led to higher prices for both consumers and businesses, as tariffs increase the cost of imported goods, which can then be passed on to consumers or absorbed by firms. While the tariffs did provide some protection to specific domestic industries by making imported goods more expensive, this protection came at the cost of reduced overall economic activity.

  <p>
   Specifically, the ITC estimated that the tariffs reduced U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.05% in 2021. This decrease reflects the combined effects of reduced imports, increased domestic prices, and retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. exports. The tariffs also led to a slight decrease in U.S. employment. The ITC estimated that the tariffs reduced U.S. employment by the equivalent of 3,670 full-time jobs in 2021.
  </p>
  <p>
   The tariffs impacted various sectors of the U.S. economy, with some industries experiencing greater effects than others. Industries that rely heavily on imported inputs faced higher costs, which reduced their competitiveness. Additionally, retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries harmed U.S. exporters, reducing their sales and profitability.
  </p>
  <p>
   The ITC report also examined the effects of tariffs on specific products, such as steel and aluminum (subject to Section 232 tariffs), and goods from China (subject to Section 301 tariffs). The report found that these tariffs led to increased domestic production in some sectors, but also to higher prices for consumers and businesses that use these products.
  </p>
  <p>
   Overall, the ITC report provides a comprehensive analysis of the economic effects of the tariffs imposed by the U.S. between 2018 and 2021. While the tariffs did offer some protection to specific domestic industries, they also led to higher prices, reduced GDP, and a slight decrease in employment. The report highlights the complex and often unintended consequences of tariffs, and it underscores the importance of considering the broader economic effects of trade policy.
