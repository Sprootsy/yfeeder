  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
   The article "What's Wrong With How Schools Teach Reading" by APM Reports investigates the science of reading and how it often clashes with the methods used in many American classrooms. It highlights a disconnect between what research has established as effective reading instruction and the practices employed in schools, leading to significant reading difficulties for many students.
  </p>
  <p>
   The core argument revolves around the importance of phonics, the relationship between sounds and letters, in early reading instruction. The article points out that many schools have moved away from systematic phonics instruction in favor of a "balanced literacy" approach. Balanced literacy often emphasizes strategies like guessing words from context and memorizing sight words, rather than explicitly teaching children how to decode words by sounding them out.

  <p>
   The investigation presents evidence suggesting that this balanced literacy approach is failing a substantial number of students. Many children struggle to become proficient readers because they haven't mastered the fundamental skill of phonics. The article includes interviews with educators, reading researchers, and struggling readers and their families. These personal stories illustrate the frustration and challenges faced by those who haven't received effective reading instruction.

   Reading researchers explain that the scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports the need for explicit and systematic phonics instruction as a critical component of early reading education. They argue that learning to decode words is not a natural process but requires direct teaching and practice. The article cites studies and data demonstrating the effectiveness of phonics-based approaches in improving reading outcomes for students, especially those at risk of reading difficulties.

   The article also explores the reasons why balanced literacy has become so widespread, despite the scientific evidence. It discusses the influence of prominent figures in the field of education who promoted whole language and balanced literacy approaches, even though their theories lacked strong empirical support. Additionally, the article touches on the role of teacher training programs, which often fail to adequately prepare teachers to implement effective phonics instruction. Many teachers are unaware of the science of reading and are therefore ill-equipped to help struggling readers.

   Furthermore, the piece discusses the resistance to change within the education system. Some educators and administrators are hesitant to abandon familiar practices, even when presented with evidence of their ineffectiveness. The article emphasizes the need for a shift in mindset and a greater emphasis on evidence-based reading instruction in schools. It calls for better teacher training, curriculum changes, and a commitment to implementing the science of reading in classrooms across the country. Ultimately, the article advocates for a return to systematic phonics instruction as a way to improve reading outcomes for all students, particularly those who struggle with reading.
