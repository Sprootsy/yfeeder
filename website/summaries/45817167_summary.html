<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is proposing a new rule that would significantly expand the collection of biometric data from individuals entering or residing in the United States. The proposed rule aims to enhance national security and improve immigration enforcement by using advanced technology to identify and track individuals. This initiative raises substantial privacy concerns and has sparked debate among civil liberties advocates and technology experts.</p>

<p>Under the proposed rule, the DHS would collect a broader range of biometric identifiers, including facial recognition data, iris scans, and voiceprints, in addition to traditional fingerprints. The data would be collected from individuals applying for visas, green cards, or other immigration benefits, as well as those encountered during border crossings or immigration enforcement actions. The DHS argues that this expanded data collection is necessary to verify identities, prevent fraud, and identify potential security threats. They state that the enhanced biometric data will improve the accuracy and efficiency of identity verification processes.</p>

<p>The proposed rule also outlines plans to share biometric data with other government agencies, both domestic and international, to facilitate law enforcement and intelligence operations. This data sharing raises concerns about the potential for misuse or unauthorized access to sensitive personal information. Critics argue that the lack of clear guidelines and oversight mechanisms could lead to violations of privacy rights and civil liberties. There are also concerns about the accuracy and reliability of biometric technology, particularly facial recognition, which has been shown to exhibit biases and inaccuracies, especially when used on individuals from marginalized groups.</p>

<p>Civil liberties organizations have expressed strong opposition to the proposed rule, arguing that it represents a significant expansion of government surveillance and poses a threat to individual privacy. They contend that the collection and storage of vast amounts of biometric data could create a permanent surveillance state, where individuals are constantly monitored and tracked. They also raise concerns about the potential for data breaches or misuse of the collected data. The organizations are calling for greater transparency and oversight of the DHS's biometric data collection practices, as well as stronger legal protections to safeguard individual privacy rights.</p>

<p>Technology experts have also weighed in on the proposed rule, raising concerns about the feasibility and effectiveness of the planned biometric data collection. They argue that the technology is not yet mature enough to reliably identify individuals in all situations, and that the collection of vast amounts of data could create a significant burden on the DHS's resources. They also caution against relying too heavily on biometric data for identity verification, as it can be spoofed or circumvented by sophisticated actors. The experts recommend that the DHS carefully evaluate the potential risks and benefits of the proposed rule before implementing it.</p>
