<h2>Summary</h2>
The article "The Hidden Engineering of Niagara Falls" discusses the extensive engineering efforts undertaken to preserve and manage Niagara Falls. While often perceived as a natural wonder, the Falls are heavily regulated to balance tourism, power generation, and environmental protection. The natural erosion of the Falls has been a long-standing concern, threatening their existence and aesthetic appeal. Historically, the Falls eroded at a rate of several feet per year.

The primary focus of the engineering interventions is to control the flow of water over the Falls. A significant portion of the Niagara River is diverted upstream and channeled through tunnels to hydroelectric power plants. This diversion reduces the amount of water flowing over the Falls, slowing erosion and allowing for greater control over the Falls' appearance. The International Niagara Control Works, a series of weirs and gates, regulates the water diversion based on the time of day and the tourist season. During peak tourist hours in the daytime, more water is allowed to flow over the Falls to enhance the visual spectacle, while at night and during the off-season, more water is diverted for power generation.

Erosion control measures have also been implemented directly at the Falls. In the 1950s, a massive cofferdam was constructed to dewater the American Falls, allowing engineers to study the rock face and implement stabilization measures. This included removing loose rock and reinforcing the crest with concrete to prevent further collapses. Similar, though less drastic, measures have been taken at the Horseshoe Falls.

The article emphasizes the ongoing nature of these engineering efforts. Monitoring the Falls' condition, managing water flow, and maintaining the structural integrity of the surrounding infrastructure require continuous attention and investment. The goal is to strike a balance between harnessing the river's power, preserving the natural beauty of the Falls, and ensuring the safety and enjoyment of the millions of tourists who visit each year. The engineering of Niagara Falls represents a complex and fascinating example of how human intervention can shape and manage a natural wonder.
