  <p>According to on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, an early Bitcoin whale shorted $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin right before the U.S. government announced tariffs on Chinese goods in May 2024. This led to a significant drop in Bitcoin's price, and the whale is now up $27 million on the trade.</p>
  
  <p>CryptoQuant's analysis suggests that the whale deposited 17,000 BTC, valued at $1.1 billion, on a crypto exchange known for derivatives trading. Shortly after this deposit, news broke about the U.S. tariffs, causing Bitcoin's price to fall from around $71,000 to $67,000. The whale then profited from this price decrease by shorting Bitcoin, essentially betting against its rise.</p>
  
  <p>The report does not disclose the identity of the whale or how they knew about the impending tariff announcement. However, it highlights the potential for insider information to influence cryptocurrency markets.</p>
