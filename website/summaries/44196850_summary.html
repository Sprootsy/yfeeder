  <p>OpenAI has published a blog post in response to the New York Times (NYT)'s data demands. The NYT filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft in December 2023, alleging copyright infringement and seeking compensation for the use of its copyrighted works to train OpenAI's large language models (LLMs). OpenAI believes that its use of news content falls under fair use, arguing that it benefits society by creating new and transformative AI tools. The company emphasizes its commitment to supporting journalism and is exploring partnerships and collaborations with news organizations.</p>

  <p>OpenAI addresses the NYT's concerns and clarifies its position on several key points:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fair Use:</strong> OpenAI asserts that training AI models on publicly available data, including news articles, is a fair use under copyright law. This practice is essential for developing AI systems that can understand and generate human-like text. They argue that the use is transformative, creating something new and different from the original news articles.</li>
    <li><strong>Limited Memorization:</strong> OpenAI acknowledges that its models can sometimes reproduce verbatim excerpts from training data, but emphasizes that this is rare. The company is actively working to minimize such occurrences. They compare this to a human who might recall a specific fact or phrase from something they've read, but that doesn't negate their ability to use that information to create new work.</li>
    <li><strong>Value for Journalism:</strong> OpenAI believes that its AI tools can be beneficial to the news industry. They are developing technologies that can assist journalists with research, content creation, and distribution. They highlight potential collaborations with news organizations to explore these opportunities.</li>
    <li><strong>NYT's Allegations:</strong> OpenAI specifically addresses examples cited in the NYT's lawsuit, arguing that the instances of verbatim reproduction are isolated and do not represent the typical output of its models. They also contend that some examples were manipulated by the NYT to elicit specific responses from the models.</li>
    <li><strong>Commitment to Collaboration:</strong> Despite the lawsuit, OpenAI expresses a desire to work constructively with news organizations, including the NYT, to find mutually beneficial ways to leverage AI technologies. They suggest exploring licensing agreements and partnerships that would support the creation of high-quality journalism.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Access:</strong> OpenAI defends its use of web-crawled data for training, emphasizing that it is a common practice in the AI industry and is essential for building robust and generalizable models. They argue that limiting access to such data would stifle innovation and hinder the development of beneficial AI technologies.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In summary, OpenAI defends its use of news content for training AI models, arguing that it falls under fair use, benefits society, and can ultimately support the journalism industry. The company addresses specific concerns raised by the NYT and expresses a commitment to collaborating with news organizations despite the ongoing legal dispute.</p>
