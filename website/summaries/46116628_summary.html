<h3>Summary</h3>

KPMG's Flash Alert 2025-116 discusses recent updates regarding social security agreements between Germany and various countries. Specifically, it highlights the resumption of negotiations between Germany and the United States concerning a social security agreement, with the first round of negotiations having taken place in Berlin from April 29 to May 2, 2024. The aim of such an agreement is to coordinate the social security systems of both countries, potentially benefiting individuals who have worked in both Germany and the U.S. by addressing issues such as double coverage, gaps in coverage, and the portability of benefits.

The alert also mentions that Germany has concluded negotiations on a social security agreement with the Republic of Moldova. The agreement still needs to be signed and ratified before it comes into effect.

Finally, the flash alert notes that a social security agreement between Germany and the People's Republic of China is expected to come into force on July 1, 2024.
