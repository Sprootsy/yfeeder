    The article "In the Long Run, LLMs Make Us Dumber" by Desunit discusses the potential negative impacts of Large Language Models (LLMs) on human intelligence and cognitive skills. It argues that while LLMs offer immediate convenience and efficiency, over-reliance on them could lead to a decline in critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and overall knowledge retention. The author begins by acknowledging the benefits of LLMs, such as their ability to quickly generate text, translate languages, and provide information. However, the central thesis revolves around the idea that constant dependence on these tools might atrophy our own cognitive functions.

    The article draws a parallel to the use of calculators in mathematics education. While calculators can speed up calculations, relying on them too early or too heavily can hinder the development of fundamental arithmetic skills. Similarly, the author suggests that LLMs might discourage individuals from engaging in the mental effort required to learn, understand, and synthesize information independently. The ease with which LLMs provide answers could reduce the motivation to think critically and deeply about complex subjects. This could, in turn, limit the ability to form original ideas and solve novel problems.

    Furthermore, the author raises concerns about the potential for LLMs to create a generation that struggles with knowledge retention. If individuals become accustomed to outsourcing their memory to these tools, they may find it difficult to recall information when LLMs are not available. This dependence could have implications for various aspects of life, including education, work, and personal development. The article also touches on the importance of intellectual curiosity and the joy of discovery. It suggests that LLMs, by providing instant answers, might diminish the intrinsic motivation to explore and learn for the sake of learning. The process of struggling with a problem, researching different solutions, and finally arriving at an answer can be a valuable learning experience in itself. By circumventing this process, LLMs could deprive individuals of the opportunity to develop resilience, perseverance, and a deeper understanding of the subject matter.

    The author also emphasizes the importance of human creativity and innovation. While LLMs can generate text that mimics human writing, they lack the originality and insight that come from genuine human thought. Over-reliance on LLMs could stifle creativity and lead to a homogenization of ideas. The article concludes by advocating for a balanced approach to the use of LLMs. It suggests that these tools should be used strategically to enhance human capabilities, rather than replace them. Education plays a crucial role in teaching individuals how to use LLMs responsibly and effectively, while also fostering critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a lifelong love of learning.
