  <h2>Summary</h2>
 

  <p>The article "Microsoft 365 Copilot: Commercial Failure?" on Perspectives.plus analyzes the potential for Microsoft 365 Copilot to be a commercial disappointment, despite its technological capabilities and integration into the widely-used Microsoft 365 suite. The author expresses skepticism about its value proposition for many users, particularly in the context of its high price point.</p>
 

  <p>One central argument is that while Copilot offers advanced AI-driven assistance with tasks like summarizing information, generating content, and automating workflows, its practical utility may be limited for a significant portion of the user base. The author suggests that many users may not fully utilize Copilot's features regularly enough to justify the cost. They question whether the productivity gains will be substantial enough to convince businesses to pay the price for each user.</p>
 

  <p>The piece also highlights the risk of "shiny object syndrome," where the novelty and hype surrounding AI tools can overshadow practical considerations of cost-benefit analysis. The author cautions against assuming that simply because Copilot is powered by advanced AI, it will automatically translate into a significant return on investment for all businesses.</p>
 

  <p>In essence, the article challenges the assumption that Microsoft 365 Copilot will be a guaranteed commercial success. It suggests that its adoption will depend on whether businesses perceive its benefits as truly outweighing its costs, and whether users genuinely integrate its features into their daily workflows in a meaningful way. Otherwise, it risks becoming an expensive add-on that is underutilized and ultimately fails to deliver on its promised productivity gains.</p>
