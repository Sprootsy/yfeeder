<h3>Summary:</h3>
The article discusses Open Source Software (OSS), emphasizing its nature as software with publicly accessible source code, enabling anyone to inspect, modify, and distribute it. It highlights the collaborative and community-driven development model of OSS, contrasting it with proprietary software. The benefits of OSS include increased transparency, customizability, and community support. The article notes that OSS projects often have licenses that define the terms under which the software can be used, modified, and distributed. The licenses vary, but they generally grant users the freedom to use the software for any purpose, study the source code, modify it, and share it. It also points out that while OSS is free as in freedom, it's not necessarily free of charge. Some projects offer paid support, services, or commercial licenses alongside the open-source version. Finally, the article mentions the widespread adoption of OSS across various industries and its importance in modern software development.
