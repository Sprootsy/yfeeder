    <h2>A statistical analysis of Rotten Tomatoes</h2>

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
   The article discusses the reliability of Rotten Tomatoes as a movie and TV show review aggregator. It explores potential biases and issues with the platform's Tomatometer score and audience score. The author points out that the Tomatometer, which reflects the percentage of critics who gave a positive review, doesn't indicate the average quality of the movie, just the proportion of critics who liked it. A film could have overwhelmingly mediocre reviews and still achieve a "fresh" rating. The article explores how the aggregation of binary "fresh" or "rotten" reviews can be misleading. It also touches on the potential influence of review bombing by audience members with agendas and the impact of studios potentially influencing critics.

  <p>
   The author references studies that suggest a decline in correlation between Tomatometer scores and actual box office performance or audience satisfaction. He brings up the issue that professional critic reviews and general audience preferences often diverge significantly, and that the Tomatometer score may not accurately reflect whether a typical viewer would enjoy a film. Also, the change of Rotten Tomatoes criteria to include only verified users to submit audience scores helped alleviate review bombing to some extent but it did not eliminate the problem.

  <p>
   The article suggests that while Rotten Tomatoes can be a useful tool for gauging critical reception, it shouldn't be the sole factor in deciding whether to watch something. The author encourages viewers to read individual reviews and consider their personal tastes. The piece suggests that Rotten Tomatoes is most reliable when it corroborates with other sources and individual taste. The article also cautions against over-reliance on a single aggregate score to determine a movieâ€™s worth. It recommends that readers use the site as one component of a larger decision-making process.
