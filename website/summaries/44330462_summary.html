    <h2>New dating for White Sands footprints confirms controversial theory</h2>

    A study published in Science confirms that human footprints discovered at White Sands National Park in New Mexico are approximately 23,000 years old. These footprints are direct evidence of human presence in North America during the Last Glacial Maximum, a period when ice sheets covered large portions of the continent, making it a very cold and difficult place for humans to live. This discovery challenges previous assumptions about the timing of human migration to the Americas, suggesting that humans arrived much earlier than previously thought.

    The initial dating of the footprints, based on radiocarbon dating of seed layers above and below the footprint layers, indicated an age range of 21,000 to 23,000 years. However, this dating was met with some skepticism due to potential issues with radiocarbon dating in the specific environment of White Sands, where ancient dissolved carbon could affect the accuracy of the results.

  <p>
    To address these concerns and provide more robust evidence, the researchers used a different dating method called optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. This method dates the sediment grains themselves, rather than organic material, and is thus not subject to the same potential contamination issues as radiocarbon dating. OSL dating confirmed the original radiocarbon dates, providing strong and independent evidence that the footprints are indeed around 23,000 years old.

    The research team collected samples from sediment layers adjacent to the footprints, taking great care to avoid exposing the samples to light, which would compromise the OSL dating process. The samples were analyzed in multiple laboratories to ensure accuracy and reliability. The OSL dating results consistently supported the original radiocarbon dates, strengthening the conclusion that humans were present at White Sands during the Last Glacial Maximum.

    The confirmed age of the White Sands footprints has significant implications for our understanding of the peopling of the Americas. It pushes back the timeline of human arrival and suggests that humans were able to adapt and survive in North America even during a period of extreme cold and glacial expansion. This finding challenges the "Clovis-first" theory, which posited that the Clovis culture, dating back around 13,000 years, represented the earliest human presence in North America. The White Sands footprints provide compelling evidence that humans were present in the Americas thousands of years before the Clovis culture.
