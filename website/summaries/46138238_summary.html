    <h2>Ghostty is now non-profit</h2>

<p>Ghostty is a new terminal emulator project created by Mitchell Hashimoto, the creator of Vagrant, Packer, Terraform, Consul, Nomad, Boundary, Waypoint, and Otto. He describes Ghostty as a "spiritual successor" to Hyper, aiming to provide a modern, extensible, and performant terminal experience. The project is being developed under a newly formed non-profit organization to ensure its long-term sustainability and independence.</p>

<p>Hashimoto details his motivation for creating Ghostty, which stems from his extensive experience with terminal emulators. He acknowledges the existence of many terminal emulators but argues that none perfectly meet his specific needs, which include high performance, modern features, and excellent extensibility. He believes the current landscape of terminal emulators has stagnated to some extent, and that Ghostty represents a fresh approach.</p>

<p>A key decision in the development of Ghostty is the use of Rust as the primary programming language. Hashimoto praises Rust's performance, safety, and concurrency features, deeming it well-suited for building a high-performance terminal emulator. Furthermore, Rust's memory safety eliminates a whole category of bugs. The codebase is MIT licensed.</p>

<p>The creation of a non-profit organization to support Ghostty is a deliberate choice. Hashimoto emphasizes the importance of ensuring the project's long-term viability, community involvement, and freedom from commercial pressures. By operating as a non-profit, Ghostty aims to attract contributions, maintain independence, and prioritize the needs of its users and contributors. The non-profit structure also provides a clear framework for governance and decision-making.</p>

<p>The project is explicitly not pursuing venture capital funding. Hashimoto believes that venture capital, while potentially accelerating development, can also lead to misaligned incentives and a focus on short-term growth at the expense of long-term sustainability and community needs. By forgoing venture capital, Ghostty aims to maintain control over its direction and prioritize its core values.</p>

<p>Ghostty is currently under development, and Hashimoto outlines some of its planned features and goals. These include a focus on performance, extensibility through plugins, and modern terminal features such as GPU rendering and improved support for Unicode and emojis. The project is still in its early stages, and Hashimoto invites contributions from the community.</p>

<p>Hashimoto's decision to create a non-profit and build Ghostty in Rust reflects a commitment to open-source principles, community involvement, and long-term sustainability. The project represents a significant investment of time and resources, driven by a desire to create a better terminal emulator for developers and other users.</p>
