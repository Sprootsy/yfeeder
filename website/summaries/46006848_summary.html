 <h3>Summary:</h3>
 <p>
 According to the Los Angeles Times article from November 16, 2025, McDonald's is experiencing a decline in patronage from low-income customers. The article attributes this shift to several factors, including rising menu prices and the availability of cheaper alternatives, such as grocery stores and fast-casual restaurants offering value menus. The increased cost of eating at McDonald's, driven by inflation and attempts to improve the quality of ingredients and service, has made it less accessible for budget-conscious consumers.

 The article highlights that while McDonald's has historically been a go-to option for affordable meals, its current pricing strategy is alienating its core customer base. Low-income individuals and families are increasingly opting for more economical options, impacting McDonald's sales and market share. The fast-food chain's efforts to attract a broader demographic through premium menu items and enhanced dining experiences have inadvertently priced out a significant portion of its original clientele.

 Furthermore, the rise of competitors offering similar or better value has compounded the problem. Grocery stores providing ready-to-eat meals and other fast-food chains with more aggressive discount strategies are drawing away customers who previously relied on McDonald's for inexpensive meals. The article suggests that McDonald's needs to reassess its pricing and value offerings to regain the loyalty of low-income customers and remain competitive in the fast-food market.
