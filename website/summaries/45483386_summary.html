<p>The article reports on a devastating fire at the National Information Resources Service (NIRS) data center in Daejeon, South Korea, which completely destroyed the government's cloud storage system. The fire, which started at 3:12 a.m. on October 1, 2025, raged for hours, consuming the entire building and resulting in the catastrophic loss of data. The incident has been particularly damaging because no backups of the data were available. The reliance on a single data center without a disaster recovery plan has led to a significant crisis, with various government functions and services severely disrupted. Details regarding the cause of the fire are still under investigation, but initial assessments suggest a possible electrical fault or overheating of equipment as potential triggers. The lack of immediate response and the intensity of the blaze are also being scrutinized.</p>

<p>The destroyed data center housed critical information related to citizen records, tax information, immigration data, and other essential government services. The absence of backups means that this data is irretrievable, causing major problems for government operations and potentially impacting citizens. For example, processing times for administrative tasks are expected to increase significantly, and accessing certain online government services has become impossible. The government is scrambling to find alternative solutions, including attempting to reconstruct some of the lost data, but the process is expected to be lengthy and incomplete. Concerns have been raised about the vulnerability of other government data centers and the urgent need for improved disaster recovery protocols. Opposition parties and experts are criticizing the government's failure to implement proper data backup and redundancy measures, calling for a thorough investigation and accountability for those responsible. The incident is expected to have long-term consequences for South Korea's digital infrastructure and cybersecurity policies, underscoring the importance of robust data protection and disaster preparedness strategies.</p>
