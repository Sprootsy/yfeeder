<h3>Summary</h3>
Bedrock Robotics, a startup founded by former Waymo engineers, has emerged from stealth mode with $80 million in funding aimed at automating construction. The company is tackling the construction industry's productivity challenges, which have remained stagnant for decades, by developing robots capable of automating tasks such as masonry, initially focusing on building walls. Their robots utilize computer vision and AI to ensure precision and efficiency, even on uneven construction sites. The robots use cameras and sensors to scan the environment and make adjustments on the fly, rather than relying on pre-programmed instructions. Bedrock's business model involves offering "robotics-as-a-service," allowing construction companies to deploy their robots without significant upfront investment. The $80 million in funding comes from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Transformation Capital. Bedrock's approach aims to improve safety, reduce costs, and accelerate project timelines in the construction industry. The company is currently working with several construction firms on pilot projects and plans to scale its operations as demand grows.
