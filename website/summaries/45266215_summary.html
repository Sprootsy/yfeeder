<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The article discusses a leaked video suggesting that the new Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses incorporate waveguide structures from Lumus. The author, Karl Guttag, analyzes the leaked video and points out details suggesting the use of Lumus Maximus or similar waveguide technology. Guttag notes that the video, while low in resolution, clearly shows the tell-tale signs of a Lumus-style folded waveguide, including the entrance and exit pupils.</p>

<p>Guttag explains the technological implications of using Lumus waveguides in the Meta Ray-Ban glasses. He notes that Lumus is known for its image quality and color uniformity compared to other waveguide technologies. However, Lumus waveguides tend to be thicker. The adoption of Lumus would represent a step up in display technology for Meta, potentially offering improved visual performance compared to previous smart glasses iterations. Guttag also speculates on the potential specifications and performance characteristics of the display, considering the capabilities of Lumus technology.</p>

<p>The author contrasts the potential use of Lumus waveguides with alternative technologies, such as those from WaveOptics (now owned by Snap) and concludes that the features visible in the leaked video point to Lumus as the likely supplier. Guttag also highlights the significance of Meta potentially choosing Lumus, as it suggests a focus on display quality and user experience. Overall, the article provides insight into the potential display technology of the upcoming Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses, based on the analysis of a leaked video.</p>
