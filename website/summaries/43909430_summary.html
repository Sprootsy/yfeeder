  <p>According to a Reuters article published on May 6, 2025, India launched attacks on nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The article details that these strikes were in response to a series of cross-border terrorist attacks that India has attributed to Pakistan-based militants. While the Indian government has declared the strikes as a necessary measure for national security, Pakistan has condemned the actions as an act of aggression and a violation of its sovereignty. The strikes have heightened tensions between the two countries, with both sides increasing military presence along the Line of Control. International reactions have been divided, with some nations urging de-escalation and dialogue, while others have expressed understanding of India's security concerns in the face of terrorism. The situation remains volatile, with concerns about potential further escalation and its impact on regional stability.</p>
