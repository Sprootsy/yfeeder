    <h2>EPA to Stop Collecting Emissions Data from Polluters</h2>

 <h3>Summary</h3>
 <p>
 According to an article published in the New York Times on September 12, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has halted its collection of emissions data from various industries. This decision, attributed to budget cuts and a shift in priorities under the current administration, effectively suspends the agency's ability to monitor and regulate pollution levels across the country. The EPA claims that the data collection is too burdensome and costly for businesses, especially small businesses.
 </p>
 <p>
 Critics of the decision, including environmental groups and former EPA officials, argue that the move undermines decades of progress in environmental protection and public health. Without accurate emissions data, it becomes exceedingly difficult to enforce environmental regulations, identify pollution hotspots, and assess the effectiveness of existing pollution control measures.
 </p>
 <p>
 The article highlights concerns that the lack of data will disproportionately affect vulnerable communities located near industrial facilities, as there will be no reliable way to track and address pollution levels in these areas. Furthermore, the absence of comprehensive emissions data could hinder the United States' ability to meet its international climate commitments and participate in global efforts to combat climate change.
 </p>
 <p>
 The long-term consequences of this decision are uncertain, but experts warn that it could lead to increased air and water pollution, damage to ecosystems, and a rise in public health problems. The EPA defends its decision by stating that it will explore alternative methods for monitoring emissions, such as relying on industry self-reporting and utilizing satellite technology. However, critics question the reliability and accuracy of these alternative approaches.
