  <p>The article is a blog post by Matthew Brunelle discussing the impact of podcasts on his app usage and how he's adapting his app subscriptions based on the value he derives from the content. Brunelle starts by highlighting the shift in his media consumption habits, noting a significant increase in podcast listening, particularly during commutes and tasks like walking his dog or doing chores. He emphasizes that his limited time and attention are now primarily directed towards podcasts, which has led him to re-evaluate his app subscriptions. Brunelle describes how he actively curates his podcast subscriptions, unsubscribing from shows that no longer hold his interest or fail to provide consistent value. He applies a similar approach to his paid app subscriptions, arguing that if an app doesn't command his attention and usage in the face of compelling podcast content, it's likely to be canceled.</p>
  <p>Brunelle uses the phrase "You altered the deal, so I will alter your app," playing on a Star Wars reference, to illustrate his point. Essentially, he contends that podcasts have altered the media consumption landscape ("the deal"), and therefore, he is altering his app subscription choices to align with his preferences. He specifically mentions unsubscribing from a weather app because he found a weather podcast to be more engaging and informative. This anecdote serves as a concrete example of how podcasts are directly displacing app usage in his daily routine.</p>
  <p>The blog post also touches on the broader implications of this shift in media consumption. Brunelle suggests that app developers and subscription service providers need to be aware of the growing competition from podcasts and other forms of audio content. To retain subscribers, apps must deliver exceptional value, provide unique experiences, and consistently capture user attention. He implies that apps which rely on passive subscriptions or fail to adapt to changing user preferences are at risk of being canceled as consumers increasingly prioritize their time and attention towards podcasts.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, Brunelle's blog post is a personal reflection on how podcasts have influenced his app subscription habits. It serves as a reminder to app developers that the media landscape is constantly evolving and that they need to proactively adapt to the changing preferences of their users to remain competitive. The rise of podcasts, according to Brunelle, has raised the bar for app value and necessitates a more discerning approach to subscription management.</p>
