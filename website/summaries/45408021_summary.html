<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The article is a webpage dedicated to a Snake game implemented using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. The author, Demian Ferrei, provides an interactive version of the classic Snake game directly on the webpage, allowing users to play it in their browsers. The page includes not only the game itself, but also a link to the source code on GitHub, encouraging exploration and modification. The game appears to have the standard Snake mechanics: the player controls a snake that moves around the game board, eating food to grow longer. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. The game keeps track of the player's score.</p>
