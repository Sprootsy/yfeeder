<p>The website "begaydocrime.com" presents a project that explores the intersection of queer identity and true crime. It's framed as a multi-faceted endeavor involving a podcast, blog, and community, all centered around the premise of examining true crime stories through a queer lens. The project aims to create a space where queer individuals can engage with the true crime genre in a way that acknowledges and addresses the often-overlooked perspectives and experiences of LGBTQ+ people within these narratives. This includes analyzing how queer individuals are represented as victims, perpetrators, or investigators in true crime cases, as well as exploring the societal factors that contribute to violence against queer individuals. The project also aims to create a supportive community space where queer people can discuss true crime. The site showcases various episodes of the podcast, blog entries and provides links to relevant social media and other platforms.</p>
