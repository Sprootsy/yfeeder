  <p>The article "Copyright Winter Is Coming to Wikipedia" discusses the potential impact of mass copyright terminations on Wikipedia and its related projects. It explains that under copyright law, works eventually enter the public domain, but some countries, particularly those in the European Union, extended their copyright terms to life of the author plus 70 years. This extension, implemented in 1995, delayed the entry of many works into the public domain. As a result, Wikipedia and similar platforms that rely on freely available content face a period where fewer new works will become freely available. This is referred to as "Copyright Winter."</p>

  <p>The article highlights the consequences of this "Copyright Winter" on Wikipedia's ability to incorporate and share knowledge. With fewer works entering the public domain, Wikipedia editors will have fewer opportunities to use source material without risking copyright infringement. This could limit the expansion and enrichment of Wikipedia's content, especially for topics related to the creative output of the 20th century.</p>

  <p>The article also discusses the implications for various types of creative works. Literary works, musical compositions, and visual arts are all affected by extended copyright terms. This means that biographies of notable figures, analyses of significant events, and discussions of cultural phenomena could be hampered by the lack of freely available source material.</p>

  <p>The article further explores the specific challenges faced by Wikipedia's sister projects, such as Wikimedia Commons, which serves as a repository for freely licensed and public domain media. As fewer images, audio files, and videos enter the public domain, Wikimedia Commons will have fewer resources to draw upon, potentially limiting its ability to provide multimedia content for Wikipedia and other projects.</p>

  <p>The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding the implications of extended copyright terms and their potential impact on access to knowledge. It calls for a discussion about the balance between protecting the rights of copyright holders and ensuring that society has access to a rich and vibrant public domain.</p>
