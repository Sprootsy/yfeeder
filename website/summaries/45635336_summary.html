A federal judge has ordered Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents to wear body cameras during certain operations in Chicago. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by the ACLU of Illinois and the Chicago Legal Protection Project regarding a 2018 raid where HSI agents allegedly detained individuals without proper identification or explanation. The judge's order mandates the use of body cameras during planned arrests, searches, and seizures, with exceptions for spontaneous encounters or situations where safety is compromised. This requirement aims to promote transparency and accountability in federal law enforcement activities within Chicago.
