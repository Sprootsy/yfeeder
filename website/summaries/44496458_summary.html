    <h2>DOJ goes after US citizen for developing anti-ICE app</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
The Department of Justice (DOJ) is prosecuting a U.S. citizen for developing and maintaining an app that allegedly obstructed immigration enforcement. The app provided information about the location of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, allowing users to avoid them. The DOJ argues that this constitutes hindering law enforcement efforts. The case raises concerns about free speech, government overreach, and the right to protest or resist government actions through technological means. The defendant argues that the app was intended to help vulnerable communities avoid potential encounters with ICE and that it is protected under the First Amendment. The legal battle centers on the balance between national security and the rights of individuals to express dissent and share information.
