<p>Tor Browser 15.0 has been released, with key updates focusing on enhancing user privacy and security. This new version is based on Firefox 115 ESR and includes important updates to various components.</p>

<p>One of the major changes in Tor Browser 15.0 is the introduction of a new, improved user onboarding experience. This aims to make it easier for new users to understand and configure the browser for optimal privacy. The onboarding process guides users through essential security settings and helps them customize the browser to their specific needs, ensuring a more secure and private browsing experience right from the start.</p>

<p>The update also includes numerous bug fixes and stability improvements. These fixes address issues reported by users and identified during testing, resulting in a more reliable and stable browsing experience. By resolving these bugs, the Tor Project aims to provide a smoother and more consistent performance for all users.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Tor Browser 15.0 incorporates the latest security patches from Firefox 115 ESR.

Keeping the browser up-to-date with the latest security patches is crucial for maintaining a high level of security and privacy.</p>

<p>The release also updates several important components, including NoScript, which is now at version 11.4.26. NoScript is a crucial extension that blocks potentially malicious scripts from running on websites, providing an additional layer of security. Updating NoScript ensures that users benefit from the latest security enhancements and bug fixes.</p>

<p>Another significant update is the inclusion of Tor version 0.4.8.8. Tor is the core component of the Tor Browser, responsible for routing traffic through the Tor network to anonymize user activity. Updating Tor to the latest version ensures that users benefit from the latest performance improvements and security enhancements in the Tor network.</p>

<p>Tor Browser 15.0 continues to support Onion Services, allowing users to access websites hosted on the Tor network. Onion Services provide an additional layer of anonymity and security for both website operators and users, making them an essential part of the Tor ecosystem.</p>
