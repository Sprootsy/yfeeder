    <h2>U.S. abandons hunt for signal of cosmic inflation</h2>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The article reports that the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) has decided to withdraw its support for the Advanced Atacama Cosmology Telescope (AdvACT), a ground-based experiment located in Chile that was designed to search for evidence of cosmic inflation, a period of rapid expansion in the very early universe. This decision marks the end of U.S. efforts to directly detect the faint polarization signal in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), known as B-modes, which are considered a telltale sign of gravitational waves generated during inflation. The pursuit of this signal has been a major goal in cosmology for decades.</p>
<p>AdvACT, along with other experiments like the South Pole Telescope (SPT), has been instrumental in mapping the CMB with increasing precision. While these experiments have provided valuable data about the universe's composition and evolution, they have not yet detected the B-mode signal attributed to primordial gravitational waves from inflation. The expected signal is extremely weak and is easily obscured by foreground emissions from dust in our galaxy, as well as by gravitational lensing effects that can mimic the inflationary signal.</p>
<p>The decision to defund AdvACT reflects a shift in priorities within the NSF and the broader cosmology community. Some scientists believe that the ground-based experiments have reached their sensitivity limits and that future progress in detecting the inflationary B-mode signal requires space-based observatories. Space-based missions can offer a much cleaner view of the CMB, free from atmospheric interference and with better control over systematic errors.</p>
<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) is currently developing a space-based mission called the Cosmic Origins Explorer (COrE), which is specifically designed to search for the inflationary B-mode signal. The Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) is also considering a similar mission called LiteBIRD. With the U.S. withdrawing from ground-based efforts, the focus of the search for inflationary gravitational waves is now shifting to these international space-based projects.</p>
<p>Despite the end of U.S. support for AdvACT, the data collected by the experiment will continue to be analyzed, and the knowledge gained from it will be valuable for interpreting data from future experiments. The article suggests that the search for the inflationary B-mode signal remains a high priority in cosmology, but the strategy for pursuing it is evolving, with a greater emphasis on space-based observations.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The NSF is ending its support for the AdvACT telescope, a ground-based experiment searching for evidence of cosmic inflation.</li>
<li>AdvACT aimed to detect B-modes in the CMB, a signature of gravitational waves from the inflationary epoch.</li>
<li>The decision reflects a belief that ground-based experiments may have reached their limits in detecting this faint signal due to foreground contamination and gravitational lensing.</li>
<li>Future efforts to detect inflationary B-modes are shifting to space-based missions like ESA's COrE and JAXA's LiteBIRD.</li>
<li>Data from AdvACT will still be analyzed and will inform future experiments, even without further U.S. funding.</li>
<li>The search for inflationary gravitational waves remains a key goal in cosmology, but the approach is evolving.</li>
