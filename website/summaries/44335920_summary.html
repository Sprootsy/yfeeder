   <p>The article describes a company's journey of migrating away from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to their own infrastructure. The primary motivations were to achieve ISO 27001 compliance and significantly reduce costs. The author outlines the challenges and benefits associated with this transition, focusing on the practical aspects of building and maintaining their own infrastructure while adhering to security standards.</p>
   <p>Initially, the company relied heavily on AWS, utilizing services like EC2, RDS, S3, and others. While AWS provided scalability and ease of use, it also presented challenges in terms of cost management and achieving the specific security requirements for ISO 27001 certification. The author argues that the "shared responsibility model" of AWS, while offering some security features, ultimately placed a significant burden on the company to configure and manage security aspects themselves, leading to complexity and potential vulnerabilities.</p>
   <p>The decision to move away from AWS was driven by the desire to have greater control over the entire infrastructure stack, from the hardware to the software. This control was deemed essential for implementing the specific security measures required for ISO 27001. Furthermore, the cost analysis revealed that running their own infrastructure would be significantly cheaper, even after accounting for the initial investment in hardware and the ongoing operational expenses.</p>
   <p>The migration process involved building a private cloud infrastructure, utilizing technologies like Proxmox for virtualization, Ceph for storage, and Linux-based servers. The author emphasizes the importance of automation and infrastructure-as-code principles to manage the infrastructure efficiently. They utilized tools like Ansible for configuration management and Terraform for infrastructure provisioning. The migration was performed gradually, moving services one by one to minimize disruption.</p>
   <p>A key aspect of the migration was the implementation of robust security measures. The author details the steps taken to secure the infrastructure, including hardening the operating systems, implementing firewalls and intrusion detection systems, and regularly auditing the security posture. They also emphasize the importance of physical security, such as securing the data center and controlling access.</p>
   <p>The results of the migration were significant. The company achieved ISO 27001 certification, demonstrating their commitment to security best practices. Furthermore, they reduced their infrastructure costs by approximately 90%. The author acknowledges that maintaining their own infrastructure requires a dedicated team and ongoing effort, but they believe that the benefits of increased control, enhanced security, and reduced costs outweigh the challenges.</p>
   <p>The article concludes by offering advice to other companies considering a similar migration. The author recommends carefully assessing their security requirements, performing a thorough cost analysis, and investing in the necessary expertise and tools. They also stress the importance of automation and continuous monitoring to ensure the security and reliability of the infrastructure.</p>
