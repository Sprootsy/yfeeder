 <h3>Summary</h3>
 <p>
 Open Culture reports that over 2,178 occult books have been digitized and made available online, primarily through the Ritman Library’s Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica collection. These texts cover a wide array of esoteric topics, including alchemy, astrology, Kabbalah, Hermeticism, Rosicrucianism, Freemasonry, and related fields. The digitization effort provides researchers, enthusiasts, and the curious with access to rare and historically significant materials that were previously difficult to access. The collection includes manuscripts and printed books, some dating back centuries, offering insight into the history of Western esotericism and its influence on culture, science, and philosophy. The project underscores the growing trend of making cultural heritage accessible through digital archives, allowing for broader engagement with these sometimes obscure and marginalized areas of intellectual history.
