The European Commission has adopted a decision concluding that Google's practices regarding the display of shopping ads and favoring its own comparison shopping service violated EU antitrust rules. The Commission found that Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by giving its own comparison shopping service an illegal advantage. This was achieved by prominently displaying its own service and demoting rival comparison shopping services in search results.
</p>
<p>
As a result, Google has been fined €2.42 billion. The Commission has also ordered Google to cease its illegal conduct within 90 days and to refrain from any measure that has the same or equivalent effect.

The Commission's investigation revealed that Google's practices harmed competition and consumers. By favoring its own comparison shopping service, Google prevented consumers from seeing the most relevant search results, ultimately limiting choice and stifling innovation. The Commission's decision aims to restore fair competition in the comparison shopping market and ensure that consumers have access to a wider range of choices.

Margrethe Vestager, the Commissioner in charge of competition policy, stated that Google abused its market dominance by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results. By doing so, Google denied other companies the chance to compete on their merits and prevented consumers from accessing the most innovative products.
</p>
<p>
The investigation covered a period of seven years and analyzed a large volume of evidence. The Commission found that Google's practices systematically favored its own comparison shopping service, regardless of its quality or relevance. This gave Google's service a significant advantage over its rivals, who were effectively shut out of the market.
</p>
<p>
The Commission's decision is a significant step towards ensuring fair competition in the digital market. It sends a clear message that dominant companies cannot abuse their position to stifle innovation and harm consumers. The Commission will continue to monitor Google's compliance with the decision and will take further action if necessary.
