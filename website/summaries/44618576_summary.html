Benjamin Franklin, one of the earliest Postmasters General, established many of the foundational practices.
 

 Over the centuries, the USPS embraced innovations such as railroads, steamships, and airplanes to expedite mail delivery. The article emphasizes that the USPS was an early adopter of technology, from telegraphs to automation in sorting and processing mail.
