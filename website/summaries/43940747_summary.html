    <h2>Business books are entertainment, not strategic tools</h2>

  <p>The article "Why Reading Business Books Is a Waste" by The Orthagonist argues against the value of reading most business books. The author contends that the information contained within these books is often either too obvious and widely known ("table stakes") to provide a competitive advantage, or too specific and context-dependent to be broadly applicable. Business books frequently repackage common sense with jargon and anecdotes, creating the illusion of profound insight without delivering actionable strategies. The core problem, according to the author, is that business is fundamentally about execution and adaptation to specific circumstances, things which cannot be effectively taught through generic frameworks and case studies.</p>

  <p>The author elaborates on the idea that successful businesses are built on unique combinations of factors, including talent, timing, and execution, which are difficult to replicate based solely on the advice found in books. The advice that seems useful is often already known by competent business professionals, making the time spent reading redundant. Furthermore, many business books focus on past successes, but the business landscape is constantly evolving, rendering past strategies obsolete. The author suggests that reading broadly across disciplines, such as history, philosophy, and science, can provide a more robust and adaptable understanding of the world, which is more valuable for making strategic decisions in business.</p>

  <p>The Orthagonist criticizes the tendency of business books to oversimplify complex situations, creating the false impression that success can be achieved by following a simple formula. The author emphasizes that the real world of business is messy and unpredictable, and that true expertise comes from experience and continuous learning through trial and error. Instead of passively consuming information from books, the author suggests actively engaging with the challenges of running a business, experimenting with different approaches, and learning from both successes and failures. The focus should be on developing critical thinking skills and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances, rather than relying on pre-packaged solutions from business books.</p>

  <p>In essence, the article argues that time spent reading business books is often better spent actively working on your business, learning from experience, and broadening your knowledge base through diverse sources. Business books, in the author's view, offer a superficial understanding that rarely translates into tangible results, and can even be detrimental by creating a false sense of confidence or leading to the adoption of outdated strategies.</p>
