   The article is a social media post by Paddi Hansen expressing concerns about the potential consequences of rapidly advancing AI technology. Hansen raises questions about the future of work, the value of human skills, and the potential for AI to exacerbate existing inequalities. The post touches on the idea that AI could automate many jobs currently performed by humans, leading to widespread unemployment and a devaluation of human labor. Hansen also wonders if skills like writing and art, which are currently seen as uniquely human, will become less valuable as AI becomes more capable in these areas. The post further explores the possibility that AI could widen the gap between the wealthy, who may own and control AI technologies, and the rest of society. Finally, Hansen questions how society will adapt to a future where AI plays a dominant role, and what measures can be taken to ensure a fair and equitable outcome.
