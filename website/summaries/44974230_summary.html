  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    The Reddit post describes a company founder's experience of making all engineers take sales calls. The founder initially faced resistance from the engineering team, who were uncomfortable and felt it was a poor use of their time. However, the founder insisted, believing it would benefit both the sales and engineering departments. The engineers were tasked with understanding customer needs and relaying that information back to the development team.

    Over time, the initiative proved surprisingly successful. The engineers gained a better understanding of the customers, their pain points, and how the product was actually being used. This knowledge led to significant improvements in product development. The engineers began to empathize with customers and became more motivated to solve their problems. They were able to identify bugs and usability issues that the sales team might have missed.

    The sales team also benefited. They gained access to technical expertise during sales calls, which improved their credibility and ability to answer complex questions. The engineers provided valuable insights into potential product improvements and new features based on customer feedback. The initiative also fostered better communication and collaboration between the sales and engineering departments.

    The founder noted that the key to success was providing the engineers with training and support. They weren't expected to become salespeople, but rather to listen, learn, and relay information. The founder also emphasized the importance of setting clear expectations and providing regular feedback.

    Ultimately, the initiative resulted in a more customer-centric culture within the company. The engineers became more engaged and motivated, the product improved, and the sales team became more effective. The founder concluded that forcing engineers to take sales calls was one of the best decisions they made.
