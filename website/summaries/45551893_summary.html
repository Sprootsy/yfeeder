   A recent incident involving a Discord server highlights the potential dangers and ineffectiveness of current online age verification methods. The server, dedicated to trading explicit images of children, was only discovered after an undercover investigation by Sky News. Despite claims of using AI-powered age verification, the server's safeguards proved easily circumvented, with children reportedly gaining access by using altered or fake ID documents. This incident underscores the challenge of policing online spaces and the limitations of relying solely on technological solutions for age verification.

The use of AI age verification systems, intended to prevent underage individuals from accessing harmful content, was shown to be flawed. The discovery of the Discord server has ignited debate about the effectiveness and ethical implications of age verification technology, particularly in the context of protecting children from online exploitation.
