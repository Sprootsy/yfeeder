<div>
<p>The provided text is a link to a GitHub repository for Microsoft BASIC for the MOS 6502 microprocessor. It contains the source code, documentation, and related files for this historical version of BASIC. The repository allows users to explore, study, and potentially rebuild or adapt the original BASIC interpreter that powered many early personal computers like the Apple II, Commodore PET, and Atari 8-bit series.</p>

<p>The repository aims to preserve and make accessible the complete source code of Microsoft BASIC as it existed for the 6502 processor. This includes the core interpreter, as well as supporting tools and documentation that were used in its development and distribution.</p>

<p>Key aspects of the repository include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The complete assembly source code for the BASIC interpreter.</li>
<li>Tools and scripts used to assemble and build the BASIC interpreter.</li>
<li>Documentation related to the BASIC interpreter, including its architecture, instruction set, and usage.</li>
<li>Information on the various platforms that this version of BASIC was implemented on, such as Apple II, Commodore PET, and Atari 8-bit computers.</li>
</ul>

<p>The repository is a valuable resource for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Computer historians interested in the evolution of programming languages and the early days of personal computing.</li>
<li>Software developers who want to study the design and implementation of a classic interpreter.</li>
<li>Retrocomputing enthusiasts who want to run or modify the original BASIC interpreter on emulators or vintage hardware.</li>
</ul>

<p>The repository also provides insights into the software development practices of Microsoft in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</p>
