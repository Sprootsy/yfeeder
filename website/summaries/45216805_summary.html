    The article is a Mastodon post by user @swaldorff discussing their experience with the SwissPass and its integration with various public transport applications in Switzerland. They describe a frustrating situation where the SBB Mobile app, used for purchasing tickets, failed to recognize their existing SwissPass, leading to the app attempting to sell them a new one.

  <p>
    The author details the steps they took to troubleshoot the issue, including checking their SwissPass account online and confirming that their SwissPass was indeed valid and linked to their account. Despite this, the SBB Mobile app insisted on selling them a new SwissPass, creating confusion and concern about potentially paying twice for the same service.

    They contacted SBB customer service via phone, where they were informed that the problem was a known issue and that they should simply ignore the prompt to buy a new SwissPass. However, the customer service representative was unable to explain why the app was behaving this way or provide a permanent solution.

    The author expresses their dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency and the poor user experience, highlighting the potential for other users to be misled into purchasing unnecessary SwissPasses. They also criticize the SBB for not addressing the issue more proactively and for leaving users to rely on word-of-mouth information from customer service representatives.

    The post concludes with a call for the SBB to improve the SwissPass integration with their mobile app and to provide clearer communication to users about known issues and workarounds. The author emphasizes the importance of a seamless and reliable public transport experience and suggests that the current situation undermines the credibility of the SwissPass system.
