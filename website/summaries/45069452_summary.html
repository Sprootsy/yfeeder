    <h2>MSNBC: Whistleblower accuses DOGE team of endangering Social Security data</h2>
    <div>
 <div>
  <p>According to a whistleblower, MSNBC has reported on concerns regarding the security of the Social Security Administration's (SSA) data due to the use of a software platform called DOGE. The whistleblower, a former contractor, alleges that the DOGE platform, used by the SSA, has serious security vulnerabilities that could expose Americans' sensitive information to unauthorized access. The platform is used to streamline disability claims processing.</p>
  <p>The contractor, who worked on the DOGE project, raised repeated internal warnings about the platform's security weaknesses. These warnings apparently went unheeded, leading the individual to file a whistleblower complaint. The whistleblower claims that the security flaws in DOGE could potentially allow malicious actors to gain access to the personal records of millions of Americans, including Social Security numbers, medical histories, and other confidential data.</p>
  <p>The whistleblower also suggests that the SSA was aware of these risks but continued to use the DOGE platform despite the security concerns. The decision to proceed with the flawed system allegedly prioritized efficiency and cost savings over data protection, potentially putting millions of citizens at risk.</p>
  <p>The whistleblower complaint also raises concerns about the qualifications and oversight of the team responsible for developing and maintaining DOGE. The contractor alleges that the team lacked the necessary expertise to ensure the platform's security, and that the SSA's oversight of the project was inadequate. This combination of factors reportedly contributed to the creation of a vulnerable system that could have dire consequences for the privacy and security of American citizens.</p>
  <p>The Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER), which is representing the whistleblower, has called for a thorough investigation into the security of the DOGE platform and the SSA's handling of the matter. They are urging Congress and relevant federal agencies to take immediate action to address the security vulnerabilities and protect the sensitive data of American citizens.</p>
