    <h2>Pakistan says rooftop solar output to exceed grid demand in some hubs next year</h2>

  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>
    Pakistan anticipates that the electricity generated by rooftop solar installations could surpass grid demand in certain areas by the following year. This projection is based on the increasing adoption of solar power, particularly among households, driven by factors such as rising electricity costs and the availability of financing options. The government is encouraging this shift towards solar energy. However, it also acknowledges potential challenges related to grid stability and the financial viability of power distribution companies (DISCOs) if a large number of consumers become self-sufficient in electricity generation through solar panels and reduce their reliance on the grid.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pakistan's energy sector has long been burdened by circular debt. This debt crisis arises from the gap between the cost of electricity generation and the revenue collected from consumers. A widespread shift to rooftop solar could exacerbate this issue by decreasing the revenue stream for DISCOs, while they would still be responsible for maintaining the grid infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>
     The Pakistani government is considering various measures to address these challenges, including revising net metering policies, introducing time-of-use tariffs, and implementing wheeling charges for solar power producers who sell excess electricity back to the grid. These measures aim to strike a balance between promoting renewable energy adoption and safeguarding the stability of the electricity grid and the financial health of DISCOs. The goal is to encourage the growth of solar energy while ensuring a sustainable and reliable electricity supply for all consumers.
