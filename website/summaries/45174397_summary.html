<p>The Los Angeles Holocaust Museum faced criticism after initially releasing and then retracting a statement regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict that included the phrase "Never Again." The statement, released on October 9, expressed solidarity with Israel and condemned Hamas's attacks, emphasizing the museum's mission to remember the Holocaust and prevent future genocides. However, the museum quickly removed the statement from its website and social media after facing internal disagreements and external pressure. Critics argued that using "Never Again" in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was inappropriate and potentially harmful, as it could be seen as minimizing the unique historical significance of the Holocaust or weaponizing its memory against Palestinians. Some felt the statement lacked nuance and failed to acknowledge the suffering of Palestinians. Supporters of the initial statement defended its right to express solidarity with Israel in the face of violence and argued that "Never Again" should apply universally to prevent all forms of mass atrocities. The museum's decision to retract the statement sparked further controversy, with some accusing it of caving to pressure and abandoning its principles. The episode highlights the complexities and sensitivities surrounding the use of Holocaust memory in contemporary political debates, particularly concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It raises questions about the role of Holocaust museums in addressing current events and the potential for such institutions to become embroiled in political controversies. The museum has not released any further public statement after taking down the original statement. The museum's leadership is facing calls to clarify its position and address the concerns raised by both sides of the debate.
