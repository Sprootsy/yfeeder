  <p>The article discusses the new Visual Search feature in Firefox desktop. This feature allows users to search for specific elements within an image directly from the browser. When a user right-clicks on an image, a "Search Image with Firefox" option appears in the context menu. Selecting this option opens a panel where the user can select a portion of the image to search for. The search is powered by Google Lens, and the results are displayed directly within the Firefox sidebar, allowing users to research and explore without leaving the current page. This integration streamlines the process of identifying objects, products, or scenes within images, providing a more efficient and convenient search experience. The feature is currently available in Firefox desktop.</p>
