<p>This article is an opinion piece arguing that Action! was the best 8-bit programming language, specifically for the Atari 8-bit computers. The author details their personal history with Action!, contrasting it with other popular languages of the time like BASIC and assembly language. They highlight Action!'s advantages, including its speed, structure, and suitability for game development. The author claims Action! offered a sweet spot between the ease of use of BASIC and the performance of assembly. The author describes its Pascal-like syntax, block structure, and the ability to create custom data types and procedures, which allowed for more organized and maintainable code. They emphasize the language's speed, attributing it to the use of a single-pass compiler that generated efficient machine code. This speed was crucial for creating fast-paced games on the limited hardware of the Atari 8-bit computers. The article provides a historical context, discussing the limitations of other languages on the Atari and explaining why Action! was a compelling alternative for serious game developers. The author points out that Action! allowed programmers to achieve performance levels close to assembly language while benefiting from a higher level of abstraction, which reduced development time and improved code readability. The article suggests that Action! enabled developers to push the Atari hardware to its limits, resulting in impressive games and demos. The author expresses nostalgia for Action! and argues that its unique combination of features made it the ideal language for the Atari 8-bit platform, despite its relative obscurity compared to more mainstream languages.</p>
