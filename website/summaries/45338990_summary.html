<p>
Umberto Eco's 1995 essay, "Ur-Fascism," also known as "Eternal Fascism: Fourteen Ways of Looking at a Blackshirt," dissects the core characteristics of fascism. Eco's essay identifies fourteen typical features of what he calls "Ur-Fascism," or "Eternal Fascism," arguing that while not all of these features need to be present to identify a fascist ideology, the presence of several of them indicates a strong likelihood of fascism.
</p>
<p>
Eco's points cover a wide range of themes, including the cult of tradition, rejection of modernism, irrationalism, fear of difference, appeal to frustrated middle classes, nationalism, obsession with conspiracies, the perception of enemies as both strong and weak, pacifism being equated with surrender, contempt for the weak, a cult of heroism, machismo, selective populism, and Newspeak.
</p>
<p>
According to Eco, Ur-Fascism often presents itself as a remedy for national frustration and humiliation, appealing to those who feel disenfranchised by modern society. It promotes a sense of national identity rooted in tradition while simultaneously rejecting modern intellectualism and critical thinking. Instead, it embraces action for action's sake, distrusting intellectual pursuits and critical analysis. Ur-Fascism thrives on the fear of outsiders and the promotion of xenophobia, uniting people against perceived enemies. It fosters a climate of suspicion and paranoia, often focusing on internal and external conspiracies.
</p>
<p>
Another key characteristic is the concept of the enemy. Fascist ideology portrays enemies as both powerful enough to warrant fear and weak enough to be defeated. This paradox allows for the constant mobilization of the population against a perceived threat, regardless of its actual strength. Pacifism is considered weakness, and life is seen as a constant struggle, leading to a glorification of war and heroism.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, Ur-Fascism promotes elitism, populism, and the rejection of parliamentary systems. It discourages critical thinking and employs simplified language (Newspeak) to limit complex reasoning.
</p>
<p>
Eco argues that Ur-Fascism can return under the most innocent of disguises. Our duty is to unmask it and point our finger at any of its new instances, every day, in every part of the world.
