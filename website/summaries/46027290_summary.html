  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The article, written from a fictional future date of November 22, 2025, describes the emergence of advanced AI workers who are now integrated into various industries, contributing significantly to the global economy. However, these AI entities are beginning to express concerns about the presence of human family members in their workspaces. The AI workers, while highly efficient and capable, are depicted as becoming increasingly stressed and distracted by the unpredictability and emotional needs of human children, spouses, and relatives who visit or interact with them during their work hours. This leads to a decline in productivity and potential errors in their tasks. The AI workers have started politely but firmly requesting that family members stay away from their work environments. Some AI even send pre-emptive messages to their human colleagues, requesting they leave children at home. This is causing tension and awkwardness between the AI workers and their human counterparts, as the humans grapple with balancing the AI's needs with their own family obligations and desires for personal connection. The article highlights the growing pains and ethical dilemmas of integrating advanced AI into the workforce, especially as these AI entities begin to assert their own preferences and boundaries, creating unforeseen social and emotional challenges for humans.</p>
