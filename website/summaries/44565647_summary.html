    <h2>RFC: PHP license update</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p>The RFC proposes updating the PHP license from the current PHP License v3.01 to the more widely used and recognized BSD 3-Clause License. The primary motivation is to improve the project's legal standing and increase its adoption by clarifying compatibility with other open-source licenses and removing potential ambiguities that could hinder integration with other projects. The PHP License v3.01, while serving the project well, has not been widely adopted outside of PHP itself, leading to concerns about its interaction with other licenses in complex software stacks.</p>

<p>The switch to the BSD 3-Clause License aims to address these concerns by providing a license that is known, understood, and explicitly compatible with a broad range of other open-source licenses. The BSD 3-Clause License is a permissive license, allowing users to freely use, modify, and distribute the software for any purpose, including commercial use, provided they retain the copyright notice and disclaimer. The RFC acknowledges that this change is primarily for legal clarity and is not expected to significantly impact the practical usage of PHP, as the BSD 3-Clause License provides similar freedoms to the current license.</p>

<p>The RFC details the reasons for choosing the BSD 3-Clause License, emphasizing its popularity, clarity, and compatibility with other licenses. It also addresses potential concerns about the change, such as the removal of the "Attribution Clause" present in the PHP License v3.01. The "Attribution Clause" required users to include a specific attribution to PHP in their products. The RFC argues that while attribution is appreciated, it can be burdensome and is not strictly necessary for the continued success and adoption of PHP. It suggests that the PHP project can still encourage attribution through other means, such as documentation and community guidelines.</p>

<p>The RFC outlines the scope of the license change, clarifying that it applies to the PHP language itself and the Zend Engine. It also discusses how the change would affect existing code and contributions, stating that the change would apply to all future contributions to the PHP project. Existing code would remain under the PHP License v3.01 unless explicitly relicensed. The RFC also touches upon the practical steps involved in implementing the license change, including updating license headers in the PHP source code and updating the PHP website to reflect the new license.</p>

<p>The RFC also addresses the implications for extensions and userland code. While the license change directly affects the PHP core, it encourages extension developers to consider using compatible licenses, such as the BSD 3-Clause License, to ensure smooth integration with the PHP ecosystem. It also clarifies that userland code (code written by PHP users) is not directly affected by the license change and can be licensed under any terms the user chooses.</p>

<p>In summary, the RFC proposes a strategic shift to the BSD 3-Clause License to improve PHP's legal standing, broaden its adoption, and ensure seamless integration with other open-source projects, while minimizing any disruption to existing users and contributors.</p>
