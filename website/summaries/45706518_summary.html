  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The article, written as a fictional news report from September 25, 2025, describes a crisis unfolding within Wikipedia, particularly affecting its language editions focused on less-resourced or "vulnerable" languages. The crisis stems from the increasing reliance on and dominance of AI-generated content, specifically from Large Language Models (LLMs), which are primarily trained on data from dominant languages like English. This creates a "doom spiral" where vulnerable language Wikipedias become flooded with AI-generated articles that, while voluminous, often lack accuracy, nuance, and cultural context. These articles, sometimes nonsensical or fabricated, begin to replace human-authored content, effectively eroding the authenticity and reliability of these language editions. The AI's biases and limitations, reflecting the biases and limitations of its training data, further exacerbate the problem, leading to a homogenization of content and a loss of linguistic and cultural diversity. The article details how human editors in these vulnerable language Wikipedias are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of AI-generated content and struggle to identify and correct errors. This leads to a decline in editor engagement and community participation, further accelerating the degradation of content quality. The piece also touches upon the philosophical implications of this trend, raising questions about the nature of knowledge, the role of human expertise, and the potential for AI to inadvertently marginalize and erase vulnerable languages and cultures. The article concludes with a sense of urgency, highlighting the need for immediate action to address the challenges posed by AI-generated content on Wikipedia and to protect the integrity and diversity of its language editions.</p>
