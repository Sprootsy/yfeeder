  <p>The article is a comprehensive guide and documentation for the XSL-Website project, a static website generator that uses XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) to transform XML source files into HTML websites. It emphasizes the use of XML as the primary content format, promoting structured and semantic content creation, and leverages the power of XSLT for flexible and customizable website generation.</p>

  <p>The documentation covers various aspects of the project, starting with its core philosophy and design principles. It highlights the advantages of using XML and XSLT, such as content reusability, separation of content and presentation, and the ability to generate multiple output formats from a single source. The guide targets users who prefer writing content in XML or are already working with XML data and want a streamlined way to publish it as a website.</p>

  <p>The article explains the project's structure, including the required directory layout and the purpose of different files and directories. It details the configuration options available to customize the website's behavior, such as specifying the input and output directories, setting the default language, and defining custom XSLT stylesheets. It includes instructions on how to install and use the generator, providing command-line examples and explanations of the available options.</p>

  <p>A significant portion of the documentation is dedicated to explaining how to write content in XML that is compatible with the XSL-Website generator. It outlines the expected XML structure, including the use of specific elements and attributes for defining pages, sections, headings, paragraphs, lists, and other common website elements. It explains how to include metadata, such as page titles, descriptions, and keywords, within the XML content. The guide also provides examples of how to create different types of content, such as blog posts, documentation pages, and image galleries.</p>

  <p>The customization aspects of the XSL-Website are thoroughly covered, including how to modify the default XSLT stylesheets to change the website's look and feel. It explains how to create custom stylesheets to handle specific content types or to implement unique design elements. The documentation also touches upon advanced topics such as using XSLT extensions, integrating with other tools and frameworks, and optimizing the website for search engines.</p>

  <p>The article provides practical examples throughout, demonstrating how to use the generator to create a variety of websites, from simple personal blogs to complex documentation portals. It also includes troubleshooting tips and solutions to common problems that users may encounter.</p>

  <p>The documentation emphasizes the importance of following best practices for XML and XSLT development, such as using semantic markup, writing well-formed XML, and adhering to XSLT coding conventions. It encourages users to contribute to the project by submitting bug reports, feature requests, and code contributions.</p>

  <p>Overall, the article serves as a complete resource for understanding, using, and customizing the XSL-Website static website generator. It caters to both beginners who are new to XML and XSLT, as well as experienced developers who are looking for a flexible and powerful tool for generating static websites from XML content.</p>
