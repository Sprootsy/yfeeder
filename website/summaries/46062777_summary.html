<h2>Summary</h2>
The article discusses the agreement reached by EU lawmakers regarding the "chat control" law, focusing on the voluntary scanning of private chats. This law aims to combat child sexual abuse material (CSAM) online. The agreement introduces a system where online service providers can voluntarily implement technologies to detect and remove CSAM. These technologies would scan users' private communications, such as messages and images, for potentially illegal content.

A key aspect of the agreement is its voluntary nature, meaning that providers are not legally obligated to implement scanning technologies. However, the article suggests that there may be strong incentives for providers to participate, potentially leading to widespread adoption of chat scanning. The article raises concerns about the potential impact on user privacy and freedom of expression. Scanning private communications, even with the intention of preventing CSAM, could lead to the detection of legal but sensitive content, such as political discussions or personal information.

Civil rights organizations and privacy advocates have voiced concerns about the potential for abuse and the chilling effect on free speech. They argue that such broad surveillance measures could disproportionately affect vulnerable groups and undermine the fundamental right to privacy. The article notes that the European Parliament and Council still need to formally adopt the regulation before it becomes law.
