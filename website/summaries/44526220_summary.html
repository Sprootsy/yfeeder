  <p>The article is an open letter from educators who refuse to adopt Generative AI (GenAI) tools in education. The letter expresses deep concerns about the potential harms these technologies pose to students, educators, and the broader educational landscape. The educators argue that GenAI tools, while appearing innovative, undermine essential aspects of learning, critical thinking, and genuine human connection. They believe that these tools prioritize automation and efficiency over the development of crucial skills and values that education should foster.</p>

  <p>The letter outlines several key reasons for their refusal. First, they argue that GenAI tools discourage original thought and creativity. By providing readily available answers and generating content on demand, these tools can hinder students' ability to develop their own ideas, analyze information critically, and express themselves authentically. The educators fear that students will become overly reliant on these technologies, leading to a decline in independent thinking and problem-solving skills.</p>

  <p>Second, the letter raises concerns about the erosion of fundamental skills. The educators believe that GenAI tools can replace the need for students to develop essential skills such as writing, research, and analysis. By automating these tasks, the tools prevent students from gaining the necessary practice and experience to master these skills. The educators worry that this will lead to a generation of students who lack the fundamental competencies required for success in higher education and the workforce.</p>

  <p>Third, the letter emphasizes the importance of human connection in education. The educators argue that learning is a social and emotional process that relies on meaningful interactions between students and teachers. They fear that GenAI tools will replace these interactions with automated systems, leading to a decline in the quality of education and a loss of the personal connection that is essential for student development.</p>

  <p>Fourth, the educators express concerns about the potential for bias and inaccuracies in GenAI-generated content. They argue that these tools are trained on data that may contain biases, which can perpetuate stereotypes and inequalities. Additionally, they point out that GenAI tools are not always accurate and can generate incorrect or misleading information. The educators worry that students will uncritically accept this information as fact, leading to a misunderstanding of the world and a decline in critical thinking skills.</p>

  <p>Fifth, the letter raises concerns about the ethical implications of using GenAI tools in education. The educators argue that these tools raise questions about authorship, plagiarism, and academic integrity. They worry that students will use these tools to cheat or plagiarize, leading to a decline in academic standards and a culture of dishonesty.</p>

  <p>Finally, the letter calls for a more thoughtful and critical approach to the use of technology in education. The educators argue that technology should be used to enhance learning, not replace it. They believe that educators should carefully consider the potential impacts of technology on students and prioritize the development of essential skills and values. They advocate for a human-centered approach to education that emphasizes critical thinking, creativity, and genuine human connection.</p>
