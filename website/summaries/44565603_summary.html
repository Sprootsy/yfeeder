DogWalk is a short, experimental 3D animated film created by Blender Studio. It explores themes of grief, letting go, and moving on. The film is about a woman named Maya who confronts the loss of her beloved dog, Blue. Maya walks through familiar places with Blue's empty collar, revisiting memories and dealing with her emotions. The project served as a testbed for new features and workflows in Blender, focusing on character design, rigging, animation, and real-time rendering using Eevee. The short aims to be both technically innovative and emotionally resonant.
