  <p>The article is a write-up about the author's experience participating in the Kryptographie CTF (kCTF) competition, specifically focusing on a challenge involving Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs). The challenge required participants to reverse engineer and optimize a VDF implementation to find a specific output within a given time limit. The article details the author's process, starting from understanding the basic principles of VDFs, analyzing the provided code (written in Rust), identifying performance bottlenecks, and implementing various optimization techniques to speed up the computation. The author describes how they initially struggled to meet the performance requirements, leading them to delve deeper into the mathematics behind VDFs and the specific algorithms used in the implementation. They explored different approaches to optimization, including parallelization, algorithm-specific tricks, and careful memory management. Ultimately, the author successfully optimized the VDF calculation to meet the challenge's time constraints and obtain the flag.</p>
