<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>The article discusses a potential shift in Tesla's approach to "Full Self-Driving" (FSD) technology. It suggests that Tesla may be moving away from its long-held promise of achieving full autonomy, where the car can drive itself in all conditions without human intervention. The change is signaled by a modification in the naming and marketing of the FSD feature. While previously marketed as "Full Self-Driving," implying complete autonomy, Tesla now appears to be emphasizing the driver-assistance aspects of the system. This shift in messaging suggests a more realistic assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of the technology. The article also suggests that this change may be influenced by regulatory pressures, safety concerns, and the technical challenges associated with achieving true Level 5 autonomy. </p>
<p>The rebranding of FSD could also reflect a strategic adjustment to manage customer expectations. By tempering the claims of full autonomy, Tesla may be aiming to avoid potential legal liabilities and reputational damage that could arise if the technology fails to deliver on its original promises. The shift could be a move to position FSD as an advanced driver-assistance system, enhancing safety and convenience but still requiring driver supervision. </p>
<p>The article highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the capabilities and safety of autonomous driving technology. It suggests that while significant progress has been made in the field, achieving full autonomy remains a complex and challenging goal. The shift in Tesla's messaging reflects a recognition of these challenges and a more cautious approach to the deployment of self-driving technology. The article emphasizes the importance of transparency and clear communication with consumers regarding the limitations of current autonomous driving systems.</p>
