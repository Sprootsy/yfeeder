    The article "Gaslight-Driven Development" by Nikita Prokopov (tonsky.me) satirically describes a software development methodology where the primary goal is to make management and non-technical stakeholders feel good and perceive progress, even if it means sacrificing actual functionality, maintainability, and developer sanity. It argues that many software projects prioritize the *appearance* of progress over genuine, working solutions, leading to a culture of illusion and manipulation.

    The article suggests that in Gaslight-Driven Development, the development team's efforts are directed towards creating demos, reports, and metrics that paint a positive picture, regardless of the underlying reality. For example, features might be prematurely declared "complete" to meet deadlines, with the understanding that they will be fixed (or more likely, abandoned) later. Code quality and testing are often neglected, as they don't contribute directly to the perceived velocity. The author paints a picture where constant refactoring is a virtue because it shows activity, even if that activity consists of pointless changes.

    The article posits that this approach is often driven by the fear of appearing unproductive or incompetent. Developers might resort to smoke and mirrors to avoid difficult conversations about technical debt, unrealistic timelines, or flawed requirements. The author suggests that Gaslight-Driven Development fosters a culture of cynicism and burnout, where developers become disillusioned with their work and lose their passion for creating high-quality software.

    The author suggests that metrics are often gamed, not used to measure real progress. Features are prioritized based on their visibility to management rather than their actual value to users. Documentation is created for the sake of having documentation, not to actually help anyone. The author describes a self-reinforcing cycle where the need to maintain the illusion of progress leads to even more questionable practices, creating a downward spiral of technical debt and developer dissatisfaction.
