<h3>Summary</h3>
The article "Inside OS/2" provides a detailed look into the OS/2 operating system, covering its history, architecture, key features, and its eventual decline.

The article starts by outlining the history of OS/2, from its initial conception as a joint project between Microsoft and IBM to succeed DOS, to its eventual divergence and IBM's sole stewardship. It describes the initial goals of OS/2, which included multitasking, memory protection, and a graphical user interface (GUI). The cooperation between Microsoft and IBM was initially strong, but differences in strategic vision led to a split. Microsoft focused on Windows, while IBM continued to develop OS/2.

The architecture of OS/2 is discussed in detail, highlighting its preemptive multitasking capabilities, which allowed for smoother and more reliable execution of multiple applications compared to the cooperative multitasking used in earlier versions of Windows. The article also emphasizes OS/2's memory management, which included virtual memory and memory protection features to prevent applications from interfering with each other or the operating system.

A significant portion of the article is dedicated to OS/2's key features, such as the Presentation Manager GUI, which offered a more advanced and visually appealing interface compared to Windows 3.0. The article also covers the High Performance File System (HPFS), which provided improved performance and storage capabilities compared to the FAT file system used by DOS and early versions of Windows. Furthermore, OS/2's support for advanced networking, including its robust networking stack, is highlighted.

The article also explores OS/2's advantages, such as stability and ability to run DOS and Windows 3.0 applications.

Despite its technical merits, OS/2 failed to achieve widespread adoption. The article explains the factors that contributed to OS/2's decline, including marketing and support from IBM, the lack of native applications compared to Windows, and the rise of Windows 95, which offered a more user-friendly experience and better compatibility with existing hardware and software. The perception that OS/2 required more powerful hardware than Windows also contributed to its downfall.

The article touches on the later versions of OS/2, such as OS/2 Warp, which aimed to improve ease of use and reduce hardware requirements. However, these efforts were ultimately insufficient to reverse the trend, and OS/2 gradually faded into obscurity. The article concludes by reflecting on OS/2's legacy as a technically advanced operating system that failed to achieve commercial success due to a combination of marketing, application support, and competition from Microsoft Windows.
