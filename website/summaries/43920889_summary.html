    <h2>Foundation DB Record Layer SQL API</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <p>The provided document is a comprehensive SQL Reference for the FoundationDB Record Layer. It details the specific dialect of SQL supported by the Record Layer, which is designed for querying data stored within FoundationDB. The document outlines the syntax, semantics, and supported features of the SQL language as it applies to interacting with Record Layer's structured data. It specifies the data types, operators, functions, and control flow structures available to developers for constructing queries and manipulating data. The document also explains how to define schemas, create indexes, and manage transactions within the Record Layer using SQL.</p>

  <p>The reference covers various aspects of SQL, including data definition language (DDL) for creating and modifying tables and indexes, as well as data manipulation language (DML) for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data. It describes the supported SQL data types (like INTEGER, TEXT, BLOB, etc.) and their characteristics within the Record Layer context. It outlines the available operators for performing arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations, and the built-in functions for string manipulation, date/time processing, and other common tasks. The SQL Reference also provides examples of how to construct complex queries using JOINs, subqueries, and aggregate functions.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the document addresses advanced topics such as indexing strategies for optimizing query performance, transaction management for ensuring data consistency and atomicity, and the integration of SQL queries with the broader Record Layer API. It also includes information on query planning and optimization techniques employed by the Record Layer's SQL engine. The documentation highlights any limitations or deviations from standard SQL to provide developers with a clear understanding of the supported functionality. Overall, the SQL Reference serves as a guide for developers looking to leverage SQL to interact with data stored and managed by FoundationDB Record Layer.</p>
