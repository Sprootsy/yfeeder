<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>According to The Register, Google has updated its Gemini AI assistant, removing the option to disable the feature. Users are now required to use Gemini if they wish to use Google Assistant on their phones. This change has generated user frustration. Many users prefer the older Google Assistant and are unhappy with the forced transition to Gemini, citing issues with its functionality and integration compared to the previous assistant. The update effectively replaces Google Assistant with Gemini on mobile devices, meaning that invoking Assistant now activates Gemini instead. The article highlights the lack of user choice in this matter, as there's no longer a straightforward way to revert to the original Google Assistant on mobile. Concerns have also been raised about the potential impact on users who rely on specific Google Assistant features that may not be fully replicated or supported by Gemini. This move appears to be part of Google's broader strategy to promote Gemini as its primary AI interface, even if it means overriding user preferences for the established Google Assistant. The article notes that while Google may believe this transition will benefit users in the long run, the immediate reaction from many is negative due to the loss of a familiar and preferred tool.</p>
