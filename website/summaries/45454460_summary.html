  <h2>Summary of "Anti-Aging Breakthrough: Stem Cells Reverse Signs of Aging in Monkeys"</h2>
  <p>
   According to the article, scientists have achieved a significant breakthrough in anti-aging research by using stem cells to reverse signs of aging in monkeys. Researchers injected senescent cells to speed up the aging process, and then injected allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to counteract the effects. The study showed promising results in improving physical fitness, reducing frailty, and restoring physiological functions in aged monkeys.
