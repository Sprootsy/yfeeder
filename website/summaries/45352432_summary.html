  <p>The article is a guide on how to set up a basic development environment for working with the Rust programming language. It covers installing Rust using `rustup`, a toolchain installer, and setting up Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The guide provides step-by-step instructions for both Windows and macOS operating systems. The instructions include downloading and running the `rustup` installer, configuring the environment (like adding cargo's bin directory to the PATH), and verifying the installation by checking the Rust version. For VS Code, it suggests installing the "rust-analyzer" extension which provides language support for Rust, including features like code completion, error checking, and code navigation. The article emphasizes the importance of these tools for a productive Rust development workflow. The guide also provides example code of a basic "Hello, world!" program written in Rust, and instructions on how to compile and run it using the `cargo` build system. It guides the user through creating a new project with `cargo new`, building the project with `cargo build`, and running the executable with `cargo run`. Finally, the document provides troubleshooting steps for when `rust-analyzer` is not working correctly and suggests ensuring that the VS Code project root is correctly set to the Cargo project directory.</p>
