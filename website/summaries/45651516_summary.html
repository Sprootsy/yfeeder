   The Financial Times article discusses the growing trend of companies, particularly in the US, using stock buybacks to return capital to shareholders. These buybacks have reached record levels, surpassing previous peaks and raising concerns about their impact on corporate investment, economic growth, and wealth inequality.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article highlights the argument that while buybacks can boost share prices and benefit shareholders in the short term, they may come at the expense of long-term investments in research and development, employee training, and capital expenditures. Critics argue that companies are prioritizing short-term gains over sustainable growth and innovation, potentially hindering their competitiveness in the long run.
  </p>
  <p>
   Furthermore, the article points out that stock buybacks disproportionately benefit corporate executives and wealthy shareholders, who often hold significant amounts of company stock. This can exacerbate wealth inequality, as the gains from buybacks are concentrated among a small segment of the population.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article also explores the debate surrounding the legality and regulation of stock buybacks. While buybacks are generally legal in the US, some argue that they should be more tightly regulated to prevent market manipulation and ensure that companies are investing in their long-term growth and the broader economy.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article notes that proponents of buybacks argue that they are a legitimate way for companies to return excess cash to shareholders when they lack profitable investment opportunities. They also contend that buybacks can help to improve a company's financial ratios and attract investors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Overall, the article presents a balanced view of the stock buyback debate, acknowledging both the potential benefits and drawbacks of this practice. It raises important questions about the role of corporations in society and the need to balance shareholder interests with the long-term health of the economy. The record levels of buybacks underscore the urgency of addressing these issues and considering potential policy changes to ensure that corporate capital is being used in a way that promotes sustainable growth and shared prosperity.
