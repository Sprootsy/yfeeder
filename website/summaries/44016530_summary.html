  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The article by Robert Heaton details a privacy concern regarding Wacom drawing tablets. It reveals that Wacom software installed on computers monitors and logs the name of every application a user opens. This data collection happens regardless of whether the Wacom tablet is actively being used with the application. The information is stored in a SQLite database on the user's computer. The author discovered this behavior while investigating unusual network activity originating from his machine, eventually tracing it to the Wacom driver. Further examination revealed the SQLite database containing application names and timestamps. While the data remains local and isn't transmitted to Wacom, the author expresses concern that this data could potentially be used in the future to profile users' software usage habits. The author speculates on the potential reasons for this data collection, suggesting it could be for telemetry, software compatibility testing, or to inform future product development. Heaton also highlights the lack of transparency from Wacom regarding this behavior, noting that it's not clearly disclosed in their privacy policies or user agreements. The article concludes by suggesting users should be aware of this potential privacy issue and consider whether they are comfortable with the Wacom software tracking their application usage.</p>
