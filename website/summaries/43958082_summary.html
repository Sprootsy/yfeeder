  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The article describes how the author, faced with challenges in maintaining focus while working from home, created a system to visually manage their time and attention using an old Nixie tube clock. The author initially struggled with the distractions of home and the difficulty of adhering to time management techniques like the Pomodoro Technique. They experimented with various methods, including apps and physical timers, but found them either too intrusive or easy to ignore.</p>
  <p>To address this, the author repurposed a Nixie tube clock, controlled by a Raspberry Pi Zero, to act as a visual focus timer. The clock displays a countdown, with the color of the tubes changing to indicate the remaining time in a work interval. The system is designed to provide a subtle but persistent visual reminder of the time, helping the author stay on task. The author programmed the clock using Python, creating a simple web interface to control the timer and customize work/break intervals. The system also incorporates a Philips Hue light to provide an additional, more noticeable alert when a work or break period ends.</p>
  <p>The author details the hardware components of the project, including the Nixie clock, Raspberry Pi Zero, a step-down converter, and the Philips Hue light. The article explains the software setup, including installing the necessary libraries on the Raspberry Pi, creating the Python script to control the clock and Hue light, and setting up a simple web server using Flask. The code allows users to start, stop, and reset the timer, as well as customize the work and break durations.</p>
  <p>The key benefit of this system, according to the author, is its unobtrusive nature. Unlike phone notifications or pop-up reminders, the clock provides a constant visual cue without being overly disruptive. The changing colors of the Nixie tubes serve as a subtle reminder to stay focused on the task at hand. Additionally, the physical presence of the clock and the act of setting it up create a stronger commitment to the work intervals.</p>
  <p>The article concludes by reflecting on the effectiveness of the system in improving the author's focus and productivity. They emphasize the importance of finding personalized solutions to time management challenges and highlight the potential of combining technology with physical objects to create more effective tools. The author also shares the code and instructions for others to replicate the project.</p>
