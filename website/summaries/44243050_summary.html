    <h2>It&#39;s the end of observability as we know it (and I feel fine)</h2>

  <p>The article discusses the evolving landscape of observability and how the traditional understanding of it is becoming outdated. It argues that observability is not merely about collecting and visualizing data (metrics, logs, and traces) but about truly understanding and reasoning about complex systems. The author contends that the current focus on the "three pillars" of observability is limiting and that a more holistic approach is needed.</p>

  <p>The author suggests that the original definition of observability, derived from control theory, emphasizes the ability to infer the internal state of a system from its external outputs. In the context of software systems, this means understanding why a system behaves the way it does, not just what it is doing. The current interpretation of observability often falls short of this ideal, focusing instead on collecting telemetry data without necessarily enabling deep understanding.</p>

  <p>The article critiques the overemphasis on metrics, logs, and traces as the sole components of observability. While these data sources are valuable, they are not sufficient for understanding complex, distributed systems. The author argues that the focus should shift from simply collecting data to asking meaningful questions and exploring the data to find answers. This requires tools and practices that facilitate exploration, correlation, and contextualization of data.</p>

  <p>The piece highlights the importance of context in observability. Raw data, such as metrics or logs, is often meaningless without understanding the context in which it was generated. This includes factors such as the specific user request, the code version, the environment, and the interactions between different services. Effective observability tools should provide mechanisms for capturing and propagating context across the system.</p>

  <p>The article advocates for a more human-centered approach to observability. It argues that observability tools should be designed to empower engineers to explore and understand their systems, rather than simply presenting them with pre-defined dashboards and alerts. This requires tools that are intuitive, flexible, and allow for ad-hoc querying and analysis.</p>

  <p>The author also points out that observability is not just a technical problem but also a cultural one. Organizations need to foster a culture of curiosity, experimentation, and learning to truly benefit from observability. This includes encouraging engineers to ask questions, explore data, and share their findings with others.</p>

  <p>The article concludes by arguing that the future of observability lies in embracing a more holistic and human-centered approach. This means moving beyond the "three pillars" and focusing on understanding the context, empowering engineers, and fostering a culture of curiosity and learning. By doing so, organizations can unlock the true potential of observability and gain a deeper understanding of their complex systems.</p>
