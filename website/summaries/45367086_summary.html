  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    The article "How Did Sports Betting Become Legal?" by Shreyas Hariharan on Substack explores the historical and legal journey that led to the legalization of sports betting in the United States. It begins by highlighting the prevalence and cultural integration of sports betting, despite its long-standing illegality outside of Nevada. The author delves into the key piece of legislation that effectively banned sports betting: the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) of 1992. PASPA prohibited states from authorizing sports betting, with an exception carved out for Nevada, and grandfathered in a few other states (Delaware, Montana, and Oregon) which had some form of sports wagering at the time.

    The article then explains how New Jersey challenged PASPA, arguing that the law violated the Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states. New Jersey's efforts were driven by the desire to revitalize Atlantic City's struggling casinos. Their legal challenge made its way to the Supreme Court in the case *Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association* (2018).
  </p>
  <p>
    The Supreme Court sided with New Jersey, declaring PASPA unconstitutional. The Court found that PASPA commandeered state legislatures by prohibiting them from enacting laws authorizing sports betting. This ruling opened the door for states to individually legalize and regulate sports betting.

  <p>
    Following the Supreme Court's decision, many states quickly moved to legalize sports betting, seeking to generate tax revenue and attract tourism. The article touches on the complexities of setting up sports betting markets, including determining tax rates, licensing operators, and establishing regulatory frameworks to ensure fair play and consumer protection. It also mentions the ongoing debate about the potential negative consequences of widespread sports betting, such as problem gambling and the integrity of sports.
  </p>
  <p>
    The author concludes by noting that the legalization of sports betting is a rapidly evolving landscape, with states continuously refining their laws and regulations. The long-term impact of this shift on the sports industry, state economies, and individual bettors remains to be seen.
