<p>The article discusses the history of desktop publishing (DTP) tools, focusing on those that have been largely forgotten despite playing a significant role in the evolution of the industry. It highlights that while Adobe PageMaker and QuarkXPress are often remembered as the dominant forces in early DTP, many other programs contributed to the field's development. The article explores several such tools, explaining their unique features, target audiences, and reasons for their eventual decline or obscurity.</p>

<p>A central theme is the rapid pace of innovation and market competition that characterized the DTP software landscape in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Many companies attempted to carve out a niche, offering different approaches to page layout, typography, and graphic design. Some programs focused on ease of use, targeting non-professional users, while others aimed at high-end professional markets with advanced features.</p>

<p>The article details specific examples of forgotten DTP software, such as Ventura Publisher, which was initially popular for its structured document approach and long document handling capabilities. It also mentions programs like Ready, Set, Go!, which was available before PageMaker and had its own set of innovative features. Other examples include Interleaf, which was known for its complex document management and SGML capabilities, and FrameMaker, which excelled in technical documentation.</p>

<p>The article notes that various factors contributed to the demise of these tools. These factors include the rise of more versatile and user-friendly alternatives, the dominance of Adobe and Quark, and the changing demands of the publishing industry. Some programs were acquired by larger companies and eventually discontinued, while others simply failed to keep pace with the rapid technological advancements. Furthermore, the shift towards WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) interfaces and the increasing integration of graphic design tools within DTP software played a role.</p>

<p>The article also emphasizes the importance of remembering these forgotten DTP tools, arguing that they represent a crucial chapter in the history of computing and digital design. By understanding the diverse range of software that was once available, we can gain a better appreciation for the evolution of modern DTP and graphic design software. It underscores that the DTP revolution wasn't solely about two major players but a collective effort of many companies and developers who contributed to shaping the way we create and publish documents today.</p>
