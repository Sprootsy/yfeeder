<p>The article is a link to a GitHub repository named "tt-tiny" by George Hotz (geohot). The repository contains code for a tiny transformer implementation in C. The transformer is designed to run efficiently and is intended to be easy to understand and modify.</p>

<p>The repository includes a single C file, `train.c`, which contains the core implementation of the transformer model. The code is heavily commented and strives for simplicity and clarity, making it accessible to those who want to learn about the inner workings of transformer models. The focus is on creating a minimal and efficient implementation rather than on achieving state-of-the-art performance. The code is designed to be easily auditable and adaptable for different use cases and hardware platforms.</p>

<p>The code's objective is to provide a working transformer implementation that can be used for character-level language modeling. The implementation includes the essential components of a transformer model, such as multi-head attention, feedforward layers, and residual connections. It is designed to train on text data and generate new text based on the patterns learned during training.</p>

<p>The repository aims to provide a clear, concise, and understandable implementation of a transformer model, suitable for educational purposes, experimentation, and deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p>
