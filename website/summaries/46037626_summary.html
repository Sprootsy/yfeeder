<p>The article discusses the full open-sourcing of Pebble's smartwatch software, marking a significant milestone for the project. After Pebble's acquisition by Fitbit in 2016, the future of the watch platform was uncertain. However, a community of enthusiasts emerged, dedicated to keeping Pebble alive. This community, known as Rebble, worked to create alternative services and keep Pebble watches functional after Fitbit shut down the original Pebble services.</p>

<p>Initially, Rebble provided replacement services that allowed Pebble users to continue using core features like timeline, app store, and voice recognition. Over time, Rebble gained more access and control over the Pebble ecosystem. A key development was the release of Pebble's mobile apps under an open-source license, which allowed the community to further develop and maintain the software. The latest step, announced in the article, is the release of the complete Pebble firmware, SDK, cloud services, and developer tools under open-source licenses.</p>

<p>This complete open-sourcing grants the community full control and ownership of the Pebble platform. Now, developers can modify, improve, and redistribute the software without limitations. This ensures the long-term viability of Pebble watches, as the community can address bugs, add new features, and adapt the software to evolving technologies. The author emphasizes that this is a unique occurrence in the tech world. Typically, when a company shuts down a product, the software disappears, but Pebble's open-sourcing allows its legacy to continue.</p>

<p>The open-sourcing includes a wide range of components, such as the original Pebble firmware, the CloudPebble IDE, the iOS and Android mobile apps, the recovery portal, and the documentation website. The software is released under the Apache 2.0 license, which allows for commercial use, modification, and distribution, as long as the original copyright notice is included. The author believes that the open-sourcing of Pebble creates opportunities for developers to learn, experiment, and create new things using the Pebble platform. He hopes that it will inspire others to consider open-sourcing their projects, even when facing closure, to allow the community to preserve and evolve the technology.</p>
