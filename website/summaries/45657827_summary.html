  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article introduces the "Database of Sovereign Acts of Neo-Nationalism" (NAN), a project that systematically collects and analyzes legislative and executive actions taken by states that reflect neo-nationalist tendencies. It defines neo-nationalism as a political project that emphasizes national identity and prioritizes the interests of the nation-state, often accompanied by exclusionary policies toward non-nationals. The database aims to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers, policymakers, and journalists to understand the global rise of neo-nationalism and its impact on various domains.

  <p>
    The database encompasses a wide range of sovereign acts, including laws, decrees, regulations, and policy statements issued by governments across the globe. These acts are categorized and coded based on several dimensions, such as the policy area they affect (e.g., immigration, trade, security, culture), the type of neo-nationalist claim they embody (e.g., protectionism, nativism, sovereignty), and the target groups they impact (e.g., immigrants, minorities, international organizations). The article highlights the methodological rigor employed in constructing the database, emphasizing the use of transparent and replicable coding procedures. It also discusses the challenges involved in identifying and classifying neo-nationalist acts, such as the subjective nature of interpretation and the need to account for contextual factors.

    Furthermore, the article outlines the potential applications of the NAN database. It can be used to track the spread of neo-nationalist policies across countries and regions, to identify patterns and trends in the types of acts adopted, and to assess the effectiveness of different policy responses. The database can also facilitate comparative research on the drivers and consequences of neo-nationalism, shedding light on the factors that contribute to its rise and the impact it has on international relations, human rights, and democratic governance. The authors express the hope that the NAN database will serve as a valuable tool for understanding and addressing the challenges posed by neo-nationalism in the 21st century.
