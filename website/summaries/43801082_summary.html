<p>The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative-backed primary school, The Primary School, in East Palo Alto, California, is set to close at the end of the current academic year. Founded in 2016 by Priscilla Chan, a pediatrician and Mark Zuckerberg's wife, the school aimed to integrate healthcare and education for underserved children from low-income backgrounds. The school served students from preschool through eighth grade. The closure is attributed to the school not achieving its initial goals. Despite substantial investment and a focus on combining education and healthcare, The Primary School struggled to demonstrate significant improvements in student outcomes compared to other schools in the area.</p>

<p>The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) invested significant resources in the school, with the goal of creating a model that could be replicated in other communities. The school offered a range of services, including medical and mental health care, alongside traditional education. The idea was to address the various challenges that students from low-income families often face, such as health issues and lack of access to resources, which can impede their academic progress.</p>

<p>According to a statement from CZI, the decision to close the school came after careful consideration and a review of the school's performance. While the school made some positive impacts, it did not achieve the desired level of improvement in student outcomes to justify its continued operation. The specific metrics and benchmarks that were used to evaluate the school's performance were not detailed in the article.</p>

<p>The closure will affect approximately 200 students and their families. CZI has committed to supporting the students and their families in transitioning to new schools. This support includes providing resources and assistance to help families find suitable alternative schools and ensuring a smooth transition for the students. CZI also plans to share the lessons learned from The Primary School with other educators and organizations working to improve educational outcomes for underserved children.</p>

<p>Despite the closure of The Primary School, CZI remains committed to its broader goals of improving education and healthcare for underserved communities. The organization plans to continue investing in other initiatives and programs that address the challenges faced by these communities. The lessons learned from The Primary School will inform CZI's future investments and strategies in the education and healthcare sectors.</p>

<p>The article highlights the challenges of creating and sustaining innovative educational models, even with significant financial resources. It also raises questions about the effectiveness of integrating healthcare and education in improving student outcomes. While The Primary School did not achieve its initial goals, the experiment provided valuable insights into the complexities of addressing the needs of underserved children and the importance of continuous evaluation and adaptation in educational initiatives.</p>
