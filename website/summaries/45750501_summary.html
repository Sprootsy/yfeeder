 <h3>Summary</h3>
 <p>The article is a comprehensive technical reference for the x86 instruction set architecture. It delves into the intricate details of x86 assembly language programming, covering a wide range of topics from fundamental concepts to advanced instructions and addressing modes. It is structured to serve as a lookup resource for programmers working with x86 processors.</p>
 <p>The document begins with an introduction to x86 architecture, highlighting its historical evolution from the 8086 processor to later extensions like those for MMX, SSE, and 3DNow!. It outlines the basic components of the x86 architecture, including the general-purpose registers (EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, etc.), segment registers (CS, DS, SS, ES, FS, GS), the instruction pointer (EIP), and the flags register (EFLAGS). It explains how these registers are used to store data, addresses, and control program execution.</p>
 <p>A significant portion of the text is dedicated to explaining the various addressing modes available in x86 assembly. These include register addressing, immediate addressing, direct addressing, register indirect addressing, based addressing, indexed addressing, based-indexed addressing, and scaled-indexed addressing. Each addressing mode is described with examples, illustrating how they are used to access memory locations and manipulate data.</p>
 <p>The article then provides a detailed catalog of x86 instructions, organized by category. These categories include data transfer instructions (MOV, PUSH, POP, etc.), arithmetic instructions (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, INC, DEC, etc.), logical instructions (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, etc.), shift and rotate instructions (SHL, SHR, ROL, ROR, etc.), comparison instructions (CMP, TEST), control transfer instructions (JMP, CALL, RET, conditional jumps, etc.), string instructions (MOVS, CMPS, SCAS, LODS, STOS, etc.), and other miscellaneous instructions.</p>
 <p>For each instruction, the article specifies its syntax, operation, affected flags, and any exceptions that may occur during execution. This level of detail makes the document a valuable reference for assembly language programmers.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the article discusses advanced topics such as interrupt handling, input/output operations, and memory management. It describes how interrupts are used to handle hardware events and software exceptions, and how the IN and OUT instructions are used to communicate with peripheral devices. It also provides an overview of memory segmentation and paging, which are used to manage memory in protected mode.</p>
 <p>The later sections of the document cover the extensions to the x86 instruction set, including MMX, SSE, and 3DNow! These extensions introduce new data types and instructions for performing multimedia and floating-point operations. The article describes the new registers (MMX registers, XMM registers) and instructions associated with these extensions.</p>
 <p>In summary, this is a technical deep dive into the x86 instruction set, providing a comprehensive reference for assembly language programmers and anyone interested in understanding the low-level details of x86 architecture.</p>
