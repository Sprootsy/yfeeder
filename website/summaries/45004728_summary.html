   <p>The article is a blog post by Mariano Gappa detailing his experience creating two card games, Truco and Brisca, in Go. He discusses the motivations behind choosing Go, which included its speed, concurrency features, and static typing. Gappa also wanted to improve his Go skills and use the project as a learning experience.

    Truco, a popular South American card game, was the initial project. The author explains that he aimed for a clean architecture using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. The design involved separating the game logic from the user interface, which was a terminal-based interface. The architecture comprised of entities like `Game`, `Player`, `Deck`, and `Card`, each with its defined behavior and state. The game flow, including dealing cards, handling player turns, and determining winners, was implemented within this structure. Gappa mentions the challenges of implementing the complex rules of Truco, particularly the "envido" and "truco" phases, which involve bluffing and escalating bets.

    Following the completion of Truco, Gappa decided to implement Brisca, another card game. He leveraged the architectural patterns and lessons learned from the Truco project. This allowed for a faster development cycle for Brisca. He reused components and adapted the game logic to fit Brisca's rules. The author emphasizes the benefits of code reuse and how the initial investment in a well-structured architecture paid off.

    Throughout the article, Gappa reflects on the challenges and insights gained. He highlights the importance of a well-defined domain model, clean architecture, and the benefits of code reuse. He shares his appreciation for Go's features, particularly its concurrency capabilities, which he believes would be valuable for implementing a networked version of the game. The author also mentions his intention to potentially create a web-based interface for the games in the future. He concludes by expressing satisfaction with the project as a whole, considering it a valuable learning experience and a showcase of his Go programming skills.
