    <h2>iOS Kindle app now has a ‘get book’ button after changes to App Store rules</h2>

   The article discusses a change in Amazon's iOS app that removes the ability to purchase digital books directly through the app. This change is due to Apple's App Store policies, which require a 30% commission on in-app purchases of digital goods. To avoid paying this commission, Amazon has disabled the purchase option, instead directing users to buy books through other means, such as Amazon's website.

   Users can still access their Kindle libraries and read previously purchased books within the app. However, when a user tries to buy a new book, they will be shown options to add the book to their wishlist, read a sample, or find the book on Amazon's website. This change brings the Amazon Kindle app in line with other digital content apps like Netflix and Spotify, which also do not offer in-app purchases to avoid Apple's fees.

   The change impacts iPhone and iPad users, who now need to go outside the app to purchase books. This creates an extra step in the purchasing process, potentially discouraging impulse buys. The move is a direct result of the ongoing tension between Apple and companies that sell digital content on iOS, with Apple enforcing its rules to ensure it receives a portion of digital sales made through its platform.
