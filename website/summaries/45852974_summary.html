<div>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>Mullvad VPN is shutting down its search proxy, Leta, on October 18, 2024. Leta was launched in February 2023 as a privacy-focused search tool that proxied requests to various search engines (Brave Search, DuckDuckGo, and Mojeek) to protect users' IP addresses. Mullvad's rationale for discontinuing the service is that it is no longer aligned with their core mission. They believe that focusing on their primary VPN service and related tools will provide more value to their users in the long run. The blog post expresses that while Leta was a useful tool, maintaining it diverts resources from their main objectives.</p>
