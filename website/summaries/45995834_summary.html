According to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) preliminary report DCA26MA024, on October 12, 2025, about 14:50 local time, a Cirrus SR22 airplane, registered as N989CD, experienced a total loss of engine power and impacted terrain during a forced landing near the Rostraver Airport (FWQ), Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania. The certificated flight instructor (CFI) and pilot receiving instruction sustained serious injuries, and the airplane was substantially damaged. The flight was being operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 instructional flight.

The flight originated from the Allegheny County Airport (AGC), West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, around 14:20. During the flight, while at 3,500 feet mean sea level (msl), the engine experienced a total loss of power. The CFI took control of the aircraft and tried unsuccessfully to restart the engine. He then elected to perform a forced landing to a field near the Rostraver Airport. During the landing flare, the airplane stalled and impacted terrain.
