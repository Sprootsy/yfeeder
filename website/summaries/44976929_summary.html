 <h2>Summary</h2>
 <p>The article "A Guide to AI Titles" discusses the confusion and lack of standardization in job titles related to Artificial Intelligence (AI). The author highlights the inconsistency in how different companies use titles like "Data Scientist," "Machine Learning Engineer," and "AI Engineer," leading to ambiguity about roles and responsibilities.</p>
 <p>The author argues that the meaning of these titles has become diluted over time. For example, "Data Scientist" once implied a blend of statistical analysis, programming, and business acumen, but now it can encompass various tasks, from basic data analysis to advanced model building. Similarly, "Machine Learning Engineer" can refer to someone who primarily deploys existing models or someone who develops new algorithms from scratch.</p>
 <p>The article suggests that the rapid evolution of the AI field and the varying needs of different organizations contribute to the title inflation and ambiguity. Startups might use grand titles to attract talent, while larger companies might have well-defined roles but still use inconsistent naming conventions.</p>
 <p>To navigate this confusing landscape, the author recommends looking beyond the job title and carefully examining the job description. Candidates should focus on understanding the specific responsibilities, required skills, and the types of projects they will be working on. It also advises asking detailed questions during the interview process to clarify the actual scope of the role and the expectations of the employer.</p>
 <p>The author suggests that instead of focusing on specific titles, candidates should try to identify the core skills and areas of expertise they want to develop and then look for roles that align with those goals, regardless of the specific title used. The article implies that focusing on skills and responsibilities rather than titles will lead to better career choices and a clearer understanding of the role.</p>
 <p>The article provides a perspective on the AI job market, emphasizing the importance of understanding the nuances of different roles and the skills required to succeed in the field. It serves as a guide for job seekers to look beyond the surface and evaluate opportunities based on their actual content rather than their perceived prestige.</p>
