    <h2>The patent office is about to make bad patents untouchable</h2>
    <div>
 <div>
  <p>The article discusses concerns about a proposed rule change by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that could significantly limit the ability to challenge the validity of patents through the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). The author argues that this change would make it much harder to invalidate bad patents, thereby harming innovation and competition.</p>
  <p>The PTAB, created by the America Invents Act (AIA), provides a less expensive and faster alternative to district court litigation for challenging patents. It has become an important tool for weeding out patents that should never have been granted in the first place, such as those covering obvious ideas or lacking novelty. The proposed rule change would allow the USPTO director to effectively overrule decisions made by the PTAB and prevent the board from even hearing certain challenges, particularly those based on arguments that have already been raised or could have been raised during the initial patent examination.</p>
  <p>The author contends that the USPTO's justification for the rule change—reducing repetitive and harassing petitions—is not supported by evidence. They argue that the current system already has mechanisms to prevent abuse and that the proposed changes would primarily benefit patent holders with weak or questionable patents, making it more difficult for companies to compete and innovate. The article emphasizes that district court litigation is a far more expensive and time-consuming process than PTAB proceedings, making it less accessible to many potential challengers. The author warns that the proposed rule change would strengthen the position of patent trolls and stifle innovation by making it harder to invalidate patents that cover basic ideas or existing technologies.</p>
  <p>The article calls on the public to oppose the proposed rule change and urges the USPTO to maintain the PTAB's role as an effective check on bad patents. The author concludes that the change would harm the public interest by protecting invalid patents and hindering competition and innovation.</p>
