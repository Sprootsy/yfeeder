  <p>The article, titled "Let Kids Be Loud," argues against the societal pressure for children to be quiet and still, particularly in public spaces. The author contends that this expectation is often unrealistic and harmful to children's development, well-being, and natural expression. They point out that children are naturally energetic and explore the world through movement and sound. Suppressing this innate behavior can lead to anxiety, frustration, and a disconnect from their bodies and emotions. The author also suggests that the demand for quiet children is often rooted in adult convenience and a lack of understanding of child development, rather than genuine consideration for the child's needs. They critique the idea that children should always be seen and not heard, emphasizing that children have a right to express themselves and be present in the world. The author acknowledges that there are times and places where quiet is necessary and appropriate, but argues that these should be balanced with opportunities for children to move, play, and be loud. They advocate for creating environments that are more accommodating to children's natural exuberance, such as playgrounds, parks, and designated "loud spaces." The author also calls for a shift in mindset, encouraging adults to be more patient, understanding, and accepting of children's noise and movement. Ultimately, the article makes a case for allowing children to be themselves, to embrace their natural energy and curiosity, and to express themselves freely, without constant pressure to conform to adult expectations of silence and stillness. They believe that this approach will lead to healthier, happier, and more well-adjusted children.</p>
