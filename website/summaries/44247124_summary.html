  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The article is a README file for the Mapbox Control Plane (MCP) Server, a project designed to manage and orchestrate various services within the Mapbox ecosystem. It describes the MCP Server as a critical component for internal Mapbox infrastructure, offering a centralized platform for tasks like service discovery, configuration management, and workflow automation. The README provides details on the server's architecture, which includes concepts like controllers, resources, and reconciliation loops. Controllers manage the lifecycle of resources, and reconciliation loops continuously ensure the desired state of resources matches the actual state. Resources represent the infrastructure or applications managed by the MCP Server. The document covers how to set up and run the MCP Server, including dependencies (like Kubernetes and Docker), configuration options, and deployment strategies. It provides information on building the server, running tests, and contributing to the project. It also mentions the availability of example configurations and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that extend Kubernetes to manage Mapbox-specific resources. The overall purpose of the MCP Server is to simplify the management and operation of a complex, distributed system, ensuring consistency, reliability, and automation across the Mapbox infrastructure.</p>
