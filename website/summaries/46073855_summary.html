     <b>Summary:</b>
   </p>
   <p>
     Polar Night Energy is set to begin construction on a 250MWh sand battery in Pornainen, Finland. This large-scale energy storage system will provide both heating and ancillary services to the grid. The facility will be connected to the local district heating grid, managed by Loviisan Lämpö, and will utilize waste heat to charge the sand battery. This waste heat will come from a Google data center. The sand battery, which uses sand as its storage medium, stores energy as heat, which can then be discharged for heating purposes during periods of higher demand or to stabilize the electrical grid. The new sand battery will have a heating power of 10 MW.

     The technology works by using electricity to heat the sand to a high temperature, typically between 500-600 degrees Celsius. The sand's excellent heat retention properties allow the energy to be stored for extended periods with minimal losses. When heat is needed, it is extracted from the sand and transferred to a water-based district heating system.

   <p>
     Polar Night Energy's first commercial sand battery is located in Kankaanpää, Finland, and provides heat to the local district heating network. The new, larger project in Pornainen represents a significant scale-up of the technology and demonstrates its potential for broader applications. It also highlights the role of energy storage in integrating renewable energy sources, improving grid stability, and reducing carbon emissions by utilizing waste heat.

     The sand battery's capability to offer ancillary services further enhances its value proposition. These services, such as frequency regulation and voltage support, are essential for maintaining a stable and reliable electricity grid. By providing these services, the sand battery can contribute to a more resilient and efficient energy system.
   </p>
   <p>
     Loviisan Lämpö's involvement underscores the importance of collaboration in deploying innovative energy solutions. The project is a step towards more sustainable and efficient heating solutions, as well as grid stabilization.
