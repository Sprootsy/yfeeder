  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>According to a Denverite article published on July 25, 2025, Denver's rental market experienced a decrease in prices during the second quarter of the year. The article attributes this shift to an increase in available rental units, driven by new construction projects and a slowdown in population growth. This created more options for renters, leading to increased competition among landlords and a subsequent drop in average rental rates.</p>
  <p>The article also notes that certain neighborhoods experienced more significant price drops than others, with areas that saw the most new construction activity generally exhibiting the largest declines. It is mentioned that while this trend is beneficial for renters seeking more affordable options, some landlords are facing challenges in filling vacancies and maintaining profitability. The report suggests that this market correction could lead to a more balanced rental landscape in the long term, providing renters with more choices and negotiating power.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the article touches upon the potential impact of these changes on the broader Denver economy, particularly in sectors related to real estate and development. While a cooling rental market could temper the rapid growth seen in previous years, it could also create opportunities for investment in affordable housing and community development initiatives. The overall outlook is one of cautious optimism, with the expectation that the Denver rental market will continue to evolve in response to changing economic conditions and demographic trends.</p>
