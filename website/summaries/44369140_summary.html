<p>A British man named Liam Corcoran was refused entry to the United States despite having visited multiple times before without issue. He was traveling to New York for a five-day vacation that he had planned for months. Upon arrival at Newark Airport, he was detained by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers and questioned about his intentions. Despite explaining his tourist plans and showing proof of a return flight, he was told he was suspected of intending to work in the US illegally. Corcoran claimed he was asked if he planned to sell merchandise related to the band IDLES, which he denied. He believes his prior attendance at multiple IDLES concerts and social media posts about the band led to the suspicion. After approximately 24 hours in detention, he was put on a flight back to the UK. Corcoran expressed frustration and disappointment, especially since he had followed all required procedures and had never previously encountered any problems entering the US. He is now seeking clarification and resolution from US authorities to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>
