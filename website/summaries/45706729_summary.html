  <p>
    Agent Lightning is a framework developed by Microsoft for building autonomous agents. It emphasizes speed, cost-efficiency, and ease of integration with existing applications. The framework facilitates the creation of agents that can perform tasks by breaking them down into smaller steps, leveraging tools, and continuously learning from their environment. It provides a structured approach to agent development, incorporating features like memory management, observation processing, planning, and execution. Agent Lightning supports various models, including those from OpenAI and Azure OpenAI, and offers flexibility in tool selection and implementation. The framework is designed to be modular, allowing developers to customize and extend its capabilities to suit specific application needs.
