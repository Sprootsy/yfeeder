  <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) announced on July 8, 2025, the selection of five companies to develop prototypes for the user interface of the digital euro wallet. This follows a call for expressions of interest published in April 2023. The chosen companies are CaixaBank, Worldline, EPI, Nexi, and Sofort. Each company will focus on a specific use case. CaixaBank will work on peer-to-peer online payments, Worldline will concentrate on peer-to-peer offline payments, EPI will handle point-of-sale payments, Nexi will focus on payments to government administrations, and Sofort will develop prototypes for e-commerce payments.
 

 The prototypes are intended to demonstrate the different ways consumers and merchants could use a digital euro. The ECB is conducting this prototyping exercise to further examine the design and user experience of the digital euro. It aims to involve various stakeholders in the process to ensure that the digital euro meets the needs of users and is user-friendly.
 

 The prototyping exercise is separate from the ongoing investigation phase of the digital euro project, which is focused on the design and distribution of the digital euro. The investigation phase began in October 2021 and is expected to conclude in the autumn of 2023. The insights gained from the prototyping exercise will contribute to the overall assessment of the digital euro project and inform future decisions.
 

 The ECB emphasizes that the selection of these companies does not indicate a decision on whether or not to issue a digital euro. The Governing Council will decide whether to move to the next phase of the project after considering the results of the investigation phase and the prototyping exercise. The ECB remains committed to ensuring that the digital euro, if issued, will be a safe, efficient, and accessible form of digital money for all Europeans.
