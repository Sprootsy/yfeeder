  <p>The GitHub blog post announces that immutable releases are now generally available. This feature ensures that once a release is created, its associated tag and release artifacts cannot be modified or deleted. This guarantees a stable and reliable reference point for users depending on the release. Immutable releases were initially introduced in beta in February 2023.</p>
  <p>The primary motivation behind immutable releases is to enhance trust and security in the software supply chain. By preventing alterations to release artifacts, developers can ensure that users always receive the exact version of the software they intend to, mitigating the risk of malicious actors injecting vulnerabilities or backdoors into existing releases. This is especially crucial for projects where security and reproducibility are paramount.</p>
  <p>The transition to general availability includes several improvements based on feedback received during the beta period. One notable change is the introduction of a new user interface that clearly indicates whether a release is mutable or immutable, improving transparency for both developers and users. Additionally, GitHub has refined the technical implementation to enhance the stability and performance of the feature.</p>
  <p>To enable immutable releases, repository administrators can configure the setting within their repository's settings. Once enabled, all subsequent releases will be immutable by default. It is important to note that enabling immutable releases is a one-way operation; once enabled, it cannot be disabled to maintain the integrity of the release history. Existing releases created before the feature was enabled remain mutable.</p>
  <p>GitHub emphasizes the importance of adopting immutable releases as a best practice for software distribution, particularly in security-sensitive contexts. They encourage developers to review their release processes and enable immutable releases to protect their users and maintain the integrity of their software supply chain. The blog post also includes links to the GitHub documentation for more detailed information on how to configure and manage immutable releases.</p>
