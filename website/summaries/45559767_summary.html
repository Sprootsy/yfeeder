    <h2>A years-long Turkish alphabet bug in the Kotlin compiler</h2>

<p>The article discusses the challenges faced by Kotlin, a modern programming language, in gaining widespread adoption within Android development in China. While Kotlin was promoted as the preferred language by Google for Android development, its adoption in China faced significant hurdles. The author attributes these hurdles to several factors, including the "996" work culture (working from 9 AM to 9 PM, six days a week) that prioritizes rapid development and immediate results over investing time in learning new technologies like Kotlin. This culture disincentivizes developers from exploring Kotlin's potential benefits, such as improved code safety and conciseness, as it requires an initial investment of time and effort.</p>

<p>Another significant challenge was the dominance of Java in the Android ecosystem in China. A large pool of experienced Java developers and extensive existing Java codebases made it difficult to justify switching to Kotlin. The perceived risk of encountering compatibility issues with existing Java code and the lack of readily available Kotlin expertise further discouraged adoption. The author also points out the influence of senior developers, who often prefer to stick with familiar tools and technologies like Java, making it difficult to introduce Kotlin to their teams.</p>

<p>The article highlights the impact of bootcamps and training programs in China, which primarily focused on teaching Java for Android development. This created a continuous stream of new Java developers, further solidifying Java's position in the market. The author also notes the fragmented Android device market in China, with numerous manufacturers and customized Android versions, adding complexity to Android development. Some developers found it easier to stick with Java, which had a longer track record and wider support across these diverse platforms.</p>

<p>Moreover, the author mentions that while Kotlin offers benefits like null safety and coroutines, some developers in China didn't see these as significant advantages over Java, particularly with the availability of tools and techniques to mitigate common Java-related issues. The learning curve associated with Kotlin, along with the perception that it might not drastically improve development speed in the short term, also contributed to its slower adoption. The article concludes by suggesting that while Kotlin may eventually gain more traction in China, the unique challenges posed by the country's work culture, existing Java ecosystem, and fragmented Android market have significantly impacted its adoption rate.</p>
