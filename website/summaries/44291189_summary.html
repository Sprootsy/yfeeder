<p>The article "SIC" by wheresyoured.at is a detailed examination of the SIC (Standard Interpreted Control) assembly language and its associated SIC/XE (SIC eXtended) architecture, often used in introductory computer science courses to teach assembly language concepts and system programming. The author meticulously describes the SIC architecture, focusing on its limited instruction set, simple memory model, and accumulator-based operations. The SIC/XE, an extended version, is also thoroughly explained, highlighting its expanded memory addressing capabilities, additional registers, floating-point support, and more sophisticated instruction formats. The article meticulously covers various aspects of SIC/XE assembly language programming, including data representation (integers, floating-point numbers, and character strings), addressing modes (direct, indirect, immediate, indexed, and PC-relative/base-relative), and instruction set (load/store, arithmetic, comparison, and control transfer instructions). It provides numerous code examples illustrating how to perform basic tasks such as input/output, data manipulation, and control flow using SIC/XE assembly. The author also discusses assembler directives, which are instructions to the assembler rather than machine instructions, used to control the assembly process, allocate memory, define constants, and organize the program. Furthermore, the article addresses the intricacies of SIC/XE program structure, emphasizing the importance of defining the program's start, end, and external references/definitions for linking with other modules. The differences between SIC and SIC/XE are highlighted, with SIC/XE offering enhanced functionalities such as more addressing modes, floating-point arithmetic, and increased memory capacity, making it more suitable for complex programs. The article also touches upon the role of assemblers and linkers in the compilation process, explaining how an assembler translates assembly language code into object code and how a linker combines multiple object files into an executable program. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding these low-level concepts for anyone interested in system programming, compiler design, or reverse engineering. The piece is written as a comprehensive guide, aimed at those learning assembly language or needing a refresher on the SIC/XE architecture, providing clear explanations and practical examples to aid in understanding the fundamentals of assembly language programming. It serves as a valuable resource for students and professionals alike looking to grasp the inner workings of computer systems at a low level.
