    This AGU press release discusses a new study that found that reforestation in the eastern United States over the past century has had a significant cooling effect on the region's climate. The research, published in the journal *Earth's Future*, used climate models and historical land cover data to investigate the impact of forest regrowth on surface temperatures. The study attributes the reforestation to factors like the abandonment of agricultural lands and active planting initiatives following extensive deforestation in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

    The researchers found that the increase in forest cover led to a decrease in average surface temperatures, particularly during the summer months. This cooling effect is primarily attributed to increased evapotranspiration, where trees release water vapor into the atmosphere, consuming energy and lowering surface temperatures. Additionally, forests tend to have lower albedo (reflectivity) compared to open land, meaning they absorb more solar radiation, which can have a warming effect. However, the study suggests that the cooling effect of evapotranspiration outweighed the warming effect of lower albedo in the eastern U.S.

    The study also considered the role of carbon sequestration by forests. While forests absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which is a greenhouse gas, the researchers focused on the direct biophysical effects of forests on temperature, such as evapotranspiration and albedo. The research highlights the importance of considering land cover changes in climate models and emphasizes the potential of reforestation as a strategy for mitigating regional warming. The findings have implications for forest management and climate change adaptation strategies, suggesting that maintaining and expanding forests can contribute to local and regional climate cooling.

    The research also suggests that the cooling effect is not uniform across the region and varies depending on factors like forest type, climate, and soil moisture. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interactions between forests and climate and to optimize reforestation efforts for maximum cooling benefits. The study acknowledges that reforestation is not a substitute for reducing greenhouse gas emissions but can be a valuable tool for managing regional climate change impacts.
