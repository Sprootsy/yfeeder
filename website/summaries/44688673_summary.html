  <p>A Florida teenager, identified as Nicolette, was arrested and detained by immigration authorities while waiting for a bus to school. Nicolette, who was born in Honduras, has been living in the United States since she was three years old and is under the guardianship of her aunt, Lisette, who has been seeking legal status for her. The arrest occurred because Nicolette lacked legal immigration status. Lisette has been trying to navigate the complex immigration system to secure Nicolette's legal residency but has faced numerous bureaucratic hurdles. The situation highlights the challenges faced by many undocumented immigrants in the United States, particularly children who have grown up in the country but lack formal legal status. The arrest has sparked outrage among immigration advocates, who argue that the focus should be on providing a pathway to citizenship for long-term residents, especially those who arrived in the U.S. as children. Nicolette's case also underscores the potential for children to be caught up in immigration enforcement, even when they have deep ties to the country and are actively pursuing legal status. Her aunt is desperately working to get her released from detention and to continue pursuing legal options for her to remain in the United States.</p>
