<p>The New York Times article, published July 8, 2025, paints a grim picture of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) collapse, attributing it largely to the influence and policies enacted during Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidency. The article describes a series of events and decisions that led to the agency's downfall, emphasizing the devastating consequences for public health and scientific integrity.</p>

<p>According to the article, Kennedy's long-standing skepticism towards vaccines and pharmaceuticals, coupled with his promotion of alternative medicine, significantly undermined the FDA's authority and credibility. Upon entering office, Kennedy appointed individuals with similar views to key positions within the agency, further eroding its ability to function based on scientific evidence. The article highlights how Kennedy's administration actively weakened regulations governing drug approvals, allowing unproven and potentially harmful treatments to enter the market. This deregulation, framed as promoting patient choice and reducing bureaucratic hurdles, ultimately led to a surge in adverse health outcomes and a loss of public trust in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

<p>The article further details how the FDA's scientific advisory boards were dismantled or filled with individuals lacking relevant expertise, leading to compromised evaluations of new drugs and medical devices. Career scientists within the agency faced pressure to conform to the administration's agenda, leading to resignations and a decline in morale. The consequences were dire, with reports of increased rates of chronic diseases and a resurgence of previously eradicated infectious diseases. The article also mentions the rise of "health freedom" movements, emboldened by Kennedy's policies, which actively spread misinformation and discouraged vaccination, contributing to public health crises.</p>

<p>The article also explores the economic ramifications of the FDA's collapse, noting the decline of the American pharmaceutical industry and the rise of foreign competitors with less stringent regulatory standards. The lack of FDA oversight also created a breeding ground for fraudulent health products and services, further endangering consumers and undermining the healthcare system. The article concludes by lamenting the long-term damage inflicted on the FDA's reputation and the challenges of rebuilding public trust in the agency's ability to safeguard public health.</p>
