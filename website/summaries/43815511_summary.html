        <h1>Tiny Emulators</h1>
        <p>
<div>
<p>
The article is a preview of 'Tiny 8bit', a collection of tiny cross-platform 8-bit computers implemented as C/C++ libraries, offering a unified system API and toolchain. The goal is to create a foundation for teaching retro computer programming and game development with educational intent. The preview consists of three emulated machines:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>tiny8bit</b>: A minimal 6502-based machine with 64KB RAM, a simple video display controller, and minimal audio capabilities.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>tiny8bit+</b>: An enhanced version of tiny8bit with more features such as a more capable video display controller, better sound, and the option for a second CPU core, memory banking, and floppy disk support.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>z80tiny</b>: A Z80-based machine with similar capabilities as tiny8bit+.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
The author emphasizes a "batteries included" approach, with all essential components provided, including the emulator cores, system APIs, build tools, and sample code, making it easy for new programmers to get started. The project prioritizes simplicity and educational value over technical accuracy or performance, aiming to lower the barrier to entry into retro programming.
</p>
<p>
The systems share a common "system API," allowing code to be easily ported between them. This API includes functions for graphics, audio, input, and other system-level operations. The build system is based on the "sokol" build system, simplifying the build process across different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, web).
</p>
<p>
Each machine includes a debugger which can single-step, set breakpoints, inspect memory, and trace code execution.
</p>
<p>
The author also provides code examples, including a minimal "Hello World" program and simple games and demos. The example code showcases the capabilities of the system API and provides a starting point for new projects.
</p>
<p>
The article concludes with a call for feedback and contributions.
