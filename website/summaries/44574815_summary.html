  <p>Helix, a modal editor inspired by Kakoune, has released its 23.05 update, bringing several new features and improvements. A standout addition is the implementation of workspace symbols, which allows users to easily navigate and manage symbols within their projects. This feature supports various languages through LSP (Language Server Protocol) and provides a quick overview of a file's structure.

  <p>The update also introduces a new "diff" mode, enhancing the editor's ability to display and interact with file differences. This mode offers improved syntax highlighting and navigation within diff views.
