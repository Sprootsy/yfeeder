    <h2>Zig got a new ELF linker and it&#39;s fast</h2>

<p>The pull request on the Zig repository introduces a new Standard Library (std) function, <code>std.ascii.isAlphanumeric</code>, which checks whether a given <code>u8</code> (unsigned 8-bit integer) value represents an alphanumeric character (A-Z, a-z, or 0-9) within the ASCII range. The implementation directly compares the input <code>u8</code> value against the ASCII ranges for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits. If the value falls within any of these ranges, the function returns <code>true</code>; otherwise, it returns <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of this addition is to provide a standardized and efficient way to perform this common check in Zig code, improving code readability and reducing the potential for errors that might arise from implementing such checks manually. By including it in the standard library, the function is readily available for use across various Zig projects without requiring developers to implement it themselves or rely on external dependencies.</p>

<p>The rationale behind adding this function is that determining whether a character is alphanumeric is a frequent requirement in many programming tasks, such as parsing, data validation, and text processing. Having a well-optimized and readily accessible implementation in the standard library promotes consistency and efficiency across the Zig ecosystem.</p>

<p>The implementation is straightforward: it checks if the input <code>u8</code> is within the ASCII ranges corresponding to uppercase letters ('A' to 'Z'), lowercase letters ('a' to 'z'), or digits ('0' to '9'). These comparisons are performed directly on the numerical representation of the characters, making the function efficient.</p>

<p>The change includes the addition of the function to the <code>std.ascii</code> module and appropriate tests to ensure its correctness. The tests cover a range of input values, including characters within the alphanumeric ranges, characters outside those ranges, and edge cases.</p>
