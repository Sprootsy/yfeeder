  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Yoko Taro, the creator of the NieR series, has voiced his concerns regarding payment processors allegedly pressuring Japanese adult content platforms. According to Taro, payment processors are increasingly scrutinizing and potentially restricting transactions related to adult content. This issue is not just about the adult content industry itself but raises broader questions about freedom of expression and potential censorship. Taro emphasizes the importance of clearly defined rules and regulations, advocating for transparency and consistency in how payment processors handle transactions involving adult content. He argues that vague or arbitrary enforcement can stifle creativity and harm legitimate businesses. Taro suggests that while content platforms and payment processors should adhere to legal frameworks, the current climate risks overreach and could negatively impact various forms of artistic expression. He calls for open dialogue and a more balanced approach to content regulation, ensuring that legitimate businesses are not unfairly targeted while still addressing genuine concerns about harmful or illegal content.</p>
