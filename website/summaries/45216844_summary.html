<div>
  <p>This GitHub repository hosts the code and resources for a project called "fartscroll-lid." It's a lighthearted and humorous project that adds a playful element to web browsing. The core functionality revolves around replacing the standard browser scrollbar with a visual representation of a toilet lid. As the user scrolls up and down a webpage, the toilet lid opens and closes accordingly, mimicking the action of a toilet lid being operated. To further enhance the humorous effect, the project integrates fart sound effects that are triggered as the lid opens and closes. This combination of visual and auditory elements creates a unique and intentionally silly user experience.</p>

  <p>The repository includes the necessary code, likely written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, to implement this custom scrollbar. It also contains the fart sound effect files that are essential for the complete experience. The project is presented as a fun and whimsical modification that can be added to websites or used as a browser extension. While the project is primarily intended for amusement, it also demonstrates how web technologies can be used creatively to alter and customize standard user interface elements.</p>

  <p>The documentation within the repository probably provides instructions on how to install and use the fartscroll-lid. This would likely involve including the project's JavaScript and CSS files into a webpage and potentially making some minor adjustments to ensure compatibility with the existing website's design. The repository may also include options for customizing the appearance of the toilet lid, such as changing its color or style, and adjusting the frequency and volume of the fart sound effects. Overall, fartscroll-lid is a simple yet amusing project that shows the possibilities for playful customization in web development.</p>
