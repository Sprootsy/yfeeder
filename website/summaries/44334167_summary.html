<div>
  <h3>Summary:</h3>
  <p>
    SMEX, along with 17 other organizations, has sent an open letter to Samsung urging the company to stop pre-installing Israeli applications on devices sold in the West Asia and North Africa (WANA) region. The letter focuses on the ethical and legal issues surrounding the forced installation of apps, particularly those developed by Israeli companies, due to the ongoing human rights concerns related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. These apps, some of which have alleged ties to the Israeli military or surveillance activities, raise significant data privacy and security concerns for users in the WANA region. The letter argues that Samsung's actions may violate international human rights laws and corporate social responsibility principles. The organizations are calling on Samsung to respect the digital rights and privacy of its customers by ending the practice of forced app installations, ensuring transparency in its app selection process, and providing users with the freedom to choose which applications they want on their devices.
