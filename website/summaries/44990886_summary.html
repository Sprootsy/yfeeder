<p>Bluesky, a social media platform, has temporarily disabled sign-ups in Mississippi due to concerns about complying with the state's new age verification law, HB 1172, which is set to take effect on July 1, 2024. The law mandates that social media companies use third-party vendors to verify the age of Mississippi users and obtain parental consent for minors under 18. Bluesky, which operates as a public-benefit limited liability company, has expressed concerns about the privacy implications, cost, and effectiveness of such age verification methods. The companyâ€™s leader, Jay Graber, emphasized that Bluesky aims to comply with the law while also being transparent about the complexities of ensuring user safety and privacy. Bluesky is exploring potential technical and policy solutions to address the law's requirements and aims to resume sign-ups in Mississippi as soon as possible. The situation highlights the broader challenges that decentralized social media platforms face in navigating varying and potentially burdensome regulations across different jurisdictions.</p>
