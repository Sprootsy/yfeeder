    <h2>The time picker on the iPhone&#39;s alarm app isn&#39;t circular, it&#39;s just a long list</h2>

  <p>The article discusses an interesting design choice in the iPhone's alarm clock app's time picker. The author points out that while the time picker appears to be a rotating drum, it isn't truly circular. Instead, it behaves as if the numbers are arranged in a straight line that loops around. This becomes apparent when scrolling quickly through the numbers. When you scroll past the last number (e.g., 12 for hours or 59 for minutes), it doesn't immediately loop back to the beginning (e.g., 1 or 0). Instead, it slows down before wrapping around. The author likens it to a "rubber band" effect. This is a deliberate design decision, not a bug.

  <p>
The reasoning behind this design is to give users a sense of where they are in the sequence and prevent them from overshooting their desired time when quickly scrolling. A true circular picker would be more difficult to control when rapidly scrolling, as there would be no indication of proximity to the beginning or end of the sequence. The "rubber band" effect provides haptic and visual feedback, making it easier to land on the intended time. It gives the user a sense of control and prevents disorientation. This creates a more user-friendly experience.

    The author contrasts this design choice with a hypothetical alternative: a truly circular picker. While such a picker might seem more intuitive at first glance, it would lack the crucial feedback that the current design provides. Without the slowing down and slight resistance at the extremes, users would likely find it more challenging to accurately select the desired time, especially when scrolling quickly.

    In essence, the iPhone's time picker prioritizes usability and control over a purely representational circular design. The subtle "rubber band" effect is a key element in achieving this balance, making the time-setting process more intuitive and less prone to errors.
