<p>Goldman Sachs published a report in April 2018 questioning the long-term sustainability of gene therapy as a business model. The report, titled &quot;The Genome Revolution,&quot; specifically examined the potential impact of curative therapies on the pharmaceutical industry. Analyst Salveen Richter posed the question of whether curing patients is a sustainable business model, given the high cost of developing and bringing these therapies to market. The report highlights the challenge pharmaceutical companies face when their products are designed to provide a one-time cure rather than ongoing treatment. This contrasts with the traditional pharmaceutical model, where companies generate revenue from chronic disease management through recurring prescriptions.</p>

<p>The report focused on the example of Gilead&#39;s hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, which offered a cure for the disease. While Sovaldi initially generated significant revenue for Gilead, sales declined sharply after a large number of patients were cured. This decline raised concerns about the long-term profitability of curative treatments. Goldman Sachs noted that the success of curative therapies could reduce the number of patients requiring ongoing treatment, potentially impacting the revenue streams of pharmaceutical companies. The report discussed the potential need for new payment models to support the development of curative therapies, such as subscription-based models or outcomes-based pricing, where payment is linked to the therapy&#39;s effectiveness.</p>

<p>The report also acknowledged the immense value of gene therapy in treating and potentially curing diseases. However, it emphasized the importance of considering the economic implications and finding sustainable business models to ensure continued investment in research and development of these innovative treatments. Without sustainable models, the report implied that investment in curative therapies could be disincentivized, potentially slowing down the progress in this field. The analysts at Goldman Sachs suggested that the industry and payers need to collaborate to find solutions that balance the need for innovation with the economic realities of the pharmaceutical market.</p>

<p>In summary, the Goldman Sachs report raised a critical question about the long-term financial viability of curative therapies, particularly gene therapies, within the existing pharmaceutical business framework. It argued that the one-time nature of these treatments poses a challenge to traditional revenue models based on chronic disease management. The report underscored the need for innovative payment models and collaboration between the industry and payers to ensure the continued development and accessibility of these potentially life-changing therapies.</p>
