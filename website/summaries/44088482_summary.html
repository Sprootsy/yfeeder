  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Authors are inadvertently including AI prompts in their published novels. These prompts, intended to guide AI writing tools, are making their way into the final versions of books available for sale. This issue highlights a growing trend where authors are using AI, like ChatGPT, in their creative processes, sometimes without fully editing or reviewing the AI-generated content. Examples have been found in both self-published and traditionally published works across platforms like Amazon. These prompts often appear as instructions to the AI, outlining specific details about characters, plot points, or writing style.

    The accidental inclusion of AI prompts raises questions about the quality control processes in publishing, as well as the extent to which AI is being used in writing. In some cases, readers have identified segments in the text that are repetitive, poorly written, or nonsensical, suggesting that these passages were not thoroughly revised. The presence of AI-generated content is often betrayed by the appearance of specific instructions or constraints that would not typically be found in a polished manuscript. The problem also brings up issues of transparency and attribution in authorship, with readers and other authors wondering if the use of AI is being adequately disclosed.

    There's a growing concern that the use of AI in writing will impact the quality and originality of literature. As authors rely more on AI tools, the likelihood of similar errors increases, potentially eroding trust in the publishing industry. Some people think authors should disclose their use of AI in creating content, so it can be clear what the author wrote and what the AI wrote.
