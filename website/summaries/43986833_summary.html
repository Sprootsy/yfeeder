<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The article is a transcript of a demonstration of the Smalltalk-78 programming environment, presented by Dan Ingalls. The demonstration highlights the key features and capabilities of Smalltalk-78, emphasizing its object-oriented nature, interactive development environment, and graphical user interface.
</p>
<p>
The demonstration begins with an overview of the Smalltalk system, explaining that everything within the environment is an object, including numbers, text, and even the environment itself. Ingalls showcases the integrated development environment, which includes tools for browsing, editing, and debugging code. He emphasizes the dynamic nature of Smalltalk, where changes can be made and tested immediately without the need for recompilation.
</p>
<p>
The transcript illustrates the process of creating and manipulating objects in Smalltalk. Ingalls shows how to define classes, create instances of those classes, and send messages to objects. He demonstrates the use of inheritance, allowing new classes to inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes. He highlights the use of blocks, which are anonymous functions that can be passed as arguments to methods.
</p>
<p>
The graphical capabilities of Smalltalk-78 are a central focus of the demonstration. Ingalls demonstrates how to create and manipulate graphical objects, such as windows, buttons, and text fields. He shows how to handle user input events, such as mouse clicks and keyboard presses. The demonstration includes examples of creating interactive applications with graphical user interfaces.
</p>
<p>
The demonstration covers the use of Smalltalk's debugging tools. Ingalls shows how to inspect objects, trace the execution of code, and set breakpoints to halt execution at specific points. He emphasizes the interactive nature of the debugger, allowing developers to examine the state of the system and make changes on the fly.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the demonstration, Ingalls emphasizes the simplicity and elegance of the Smalltalk language and environment. He highlights the power of object-oriented programming and the benefits of an interactive development environment. The demonstration aims to show how Smalltalk can be used to create a wide variety of applications, from simple text-based programs to complex graphical user interfaces.
