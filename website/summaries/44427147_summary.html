<p>The average wholesale price of rice in Japan has fallen below ¥4,000 per 60 kilograms for the first time in six years, due to weak demand and an oversupply. This decline is attributed to changing dietary habits, a shrinking population, and increased production spurred by government subsidies aimed at encouraging farmers to switch from growing wheat and soybeans to rice. The agriculture ministry reported the average price for the week of June 10-16 was ¥3,994, a drop of ¥86 from the previous week. Prices have been falling since last autumn's harvest, influenced by factors such as decreased rice consumption and increased yields. The government has been trying to manage the rice surplus by promoting exports and using rice for animal feed, but these measures have not been sufficient to halt the price decline. The situation is particularly concerning for rice farmers, who are facing reduced incomes as a result of the lower prices.</p>
