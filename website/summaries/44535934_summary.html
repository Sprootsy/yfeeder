    <h2>Belkin shows tech firms getting too comfortable with bricking customers&#39; stuff</h2>

  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The article discusses Belkin's recent decision to remotely disable a feature on its Wemo smart plug devices, specifically the ability to control them locally via a dedicated app, without relying on Belkin's cloud servers. This change, which affected older models of the Wemo smart plug, effectively bricked a core functionality for users who preferred or depended on local control. The author argues that this incident is part of a troubling trend among tech companies, where they are becoming increasingly comfortable with remotely disabling features or even rendering devices useless, often under the guise of security updates, cost savings, or end-of-life support. The article highlights the concerns surrounding the long-term ownership and control of purchased hardware and software, emphasizing that users are essentially renting products that can be unilaterally altered or disabled by the manufacturer. The Wemo case is used as a prime example of how companies can erode consumer trust by taking away functionality that was originally advertised and sold, leaving customers with diminished or non-functional devices. The author also notes the lack of legal recourse for consumers in such situations, and the potential environmental impact of prematurely obsolete devices.</p>
