  <p>This article by Sean Goedecke discusses the process of building AI products, focusing on practical steps and considerations beyond just having a good AI model. It emphasizes the importance of user-centric design, data strategy, and infrastructure for successful AI product development. The article outlines a structured approach to building AI products, starting with understanding user needs and defining the problem the AI will solve. It stresses the need to go beyond simply automating existing processes and to identify opportunities to create entirely new value propositions. Furthermore, the author underscores the significance of having a robust data strategy, including data acquisition, labeling, storage, and governance. The piece highlights the challenges of data quality and the need for continuous monitoring and improvement of both data and models. Regarding infrastructure, the article covers the need for scalable and reliable systems to deploy, monitor, and manage AI models in production. This includes considerations for model serving, monitoring performance, and implementing retraining pipelines. The article also delves into the crucial aspect of explainability and transparency in AI products, especially in regulated industries or when dealing with sensitive data. Finally, it underscores the importance of a product-led approach, emphasizing iterative development, user feedback, and continuous improvement as essential components of building successful and valuable AI products.</p>
