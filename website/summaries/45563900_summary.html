<p>The article on Atlas Obscura explores the history of Korean food, highlighting its evolution through various periods and influences. It begins by noting the significance of food in Korean culture, extending beyond mere sustenance to encompass hospitality, tradition, and social connection. The history is deeply intertwined with the Korean peninsula's geography and climate, resulting in a diet heavily reliant on grains, vegetables, and seafood, with fermentation playing a crucial role in preservation and flavor development.</p>

<p>The narrative traces back to prehistoric times, where evidence suggests the consumption of grains like millet and barley. The introduction of rice cultivation marked a significant shift, becoming a staple food and influencing agricultural practices. The Three Kingdoms period (57 BCE – 668 CE) saw the development of more elaborate cuisine, influenced by neighboring China and characterized by increased use of meats and fermented foods. Buddhism's rise during this era impacted dietary habits, promoting vegetarianism, at least within monastic communities and among the elite.</p>

<p>The Goryeo Dynasty (918–1392) witnessed the refinement of Korean cuisine, with tea ceremonies gaining prominence and the development of more sophisticated dishes. Trade with other countries introduced new ingredients, further diversifying the culinary landscape. The Joseon Dynasty (1392–1910) brought about a more structured and formalized approach to food, influenced by Confucian ideals. Royal cuisine became increasingly elaborate, showcasing a wide array of dishes and preparation methods. This period also saw the codification of culinary practices through cookbooks and the emphasis on seasonal ingredients.</p>

<p>The introduction of chili peppers from the Americas via Japan in the 17th century revolutionized Korean cuisine, leading to the ubiquitous use of gochujang (fermented chili paste) and kimchi as cornerstones of the Korean diet. Different regions developed their own unique variations of kimchi, reflecting local ingredients and preferences.</p>

<p>The Japanese colonial period (1910–1945) had a profound impact on Korean food culture. Many traditional dishes were suppressed or altered, and Japanese cuisine exerted influence on Korean culinary practices. The Korean War (1950–1953) further disrupted food production and distribution, leading to widespread food shortages and the adoption of simpler, more readily available meals.</p>

<p>Following the Korean War, South Korea experienced rapid economic growth, which led to a resurgence of interest in traditional Korean cuisine. There was a conscious effort to preserve and promote Korean food culture, both domestically and internationally. The article highlights the increasing popularity of Korean food globally, driven by the Korean Wave (Hallyu) and the growing appreciation for its unique flavors and health benefits. The modern Korean diet reflects a blend of traditional dishes and contemporary influences, with ongoing innovation and adaptation to meet changing tastes and lifestyles.</p>
