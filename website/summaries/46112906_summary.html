  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    The presentation discusses Large Language Models (LLMs) and their transformative impact, focusing on their capabilities, challenges, and ethical considerations. It begins by introducing LLMs like ChatGPT, explaining that they are trained on massive datasets of text and code to generate human-like text, translate languages, and answer questions. The presentation highlights that LLMs operate by predicting the next word in a sequence, leveraging a deep understanding of patterns and relationships in language.
