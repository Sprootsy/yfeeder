  <p>The Wikimedia Foundation has published a Human Rights Impact Assessment (HRIA) focusing on the interaction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with Wikimedia projects. The assessment explores the potential impacts, both positive and negative, of AI/ML on human rights, particularly the rights to freedom of expression and access to information. It examines how AI is currently being used on Wikimedia projects and how it might be used in the future. The HRIA identifies several key areas of concern, including bias in AI algorithms, the potential for censorship and manipulation, and the impact on the volunteer community that creates and maintains Wikimedia projects. It provides recommendations for mitigating these risks and ensuring that AI is used in a way that serves the interests of the public and supports the Wikimedia mission of providing free access to knowledge.</p>
  <p>The assessment acknowledges the potential benefits of AI/ML, such as improving the quality and accuracy of information, automating tasks, and making knowledge more accessible. However, it emphasizes the importance of addressing the potential risks, including the spread of misinformation, the erosion of trust in information, and the marginalization of certain groups or perspectives. The HRIA highlights the need for transparency, accountability, and human oversight in the development and deployment of AI systems on Wikimedia projects.</p>
  <p>To address the challenges, the HRIA recommends several actions for the Wikimedia Foundation and the broader AI community. These include developing clear guidelines and policies for the use of AI on Wikimedia projects, investing in research to understand and mitigate bias in AI algorithms, promoting transparency and explainability in AI systems, and engaging with the Wikimedia community to ensure that AI is used in a way that aligns with their values and goals. The assessment also calls for collaboration with other organizations and stakeholders to address the broader societal impacts of AI.</p>
  <p>The Wikimedia Foundation aims to use the findings of the HRIA to inform its own work and to contribute to a broader conversation about the responsible development and use of AI. The Foundation recognizes that AI has the potential to be a powerful tool for advancing its mission, but it is committed to ensuring that AI is used in a way that respects human rights and promotes the free and open exchange of knowledge.</p>
