    <h2>Z3 API in Python: From Sudoku to N-Queens in Under 20 Lines</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <p>This article is a tutorial on how to use Z3, a theorem prover from Microsoft Research, with its Python bindings (Z3Py). It covers various aspects of using Z3 to solve constraints and model problems.
</p>
<p>
  The tutorial starts by introducing the basic concepts of Z3, such as declaring variables of different types (integers, reals, Booleans, bit-vectors, arrays, datatypes) and creating constraints using logical operators. It explains how to solve these constraints using the `solve()` function and how to check the satisfiability of a set of constraints.  The article demonstrates how to retrieve a model when a solution is found, allowing you to inspect the values assigned to the variables.
</p>
<p>
  The article explains how to simplify and display the results.
</p>
<p>
  Several examples are presented to illustrate the use of Z3 in different scenarios. These examples include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Solving simple arithmetic and Boolean puzzles.</li>
  <li>Finding solutions to systems of equations.</li>
  <li>Using quantifiers to express properties over ranges of values.</li>
  <li>Modeling and solving Sudoku puzzles.</li>
  <li>Solving the N-Queens problem.</li>
  <li>Solving the Water Jug problem, demonstrating the use of arrays to model state.</li>
  <li>Using datatypes to model lists and other recursive structures, including defining functions to operate on those datatypes.</li>
  <li>Defining recursive functions and proving properties about them.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The tutorial also demonstrates the use of tactics and solvers in Z3. Tactics are simplification and solving strategies that can be applied to a goal. Solvers are the engines that actually find solutions to the constraints.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, the article touches upon advanced topics such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using Z3 to verify software.</li>
  <li>Finding errors in programs.</li>
</ul>
