According to Bloomberg, videos of Tesla's robotaxi prototypes, internally called "Cybercab," reveal instances of speeding and driving into the wrong lane during testing. These videos, which Bloomberg reviewed, raise concerns about the readiness and safety of Tesla's autonomous driving technology. The Cybercab is intended to be a fully autonomous vehicle, and these videos suggest that the technology may not yet be refined enough for safe public deployment.
