 <h3>Summary:</h3>
 <p>
 The article discusses the agreement between leading AI companies, including Anthropic, and the White House regarding responsible AI development. These companies voluntarily committed to certain safety measures, such as watermarking AI-generated content and allowing for external security testing. However, a recent report indicates that Anthropic has placed stricter limits on how its AI models can be used for political activities than other companies.
 </p>
 <p>
 Specifically, Anthropic's policy prohibits the use of its AI to create content related to elections or political issues, even for non-partisan voter information. This goes beyond the White House's expectations, which primarily focused on preventing deceptive or misleading content. Some sources suggest that the White House is privately displeased with Anthropic's approach, viewing it as overly restrictive and potentially hindering legitimate uses of AI in the political sphere.
 </p>
 <p>
 The concern is that such broad limitations could prevent the use of AI for tasks like answering voters' questions about candidates' stances or creating accessible information about polling locations. While Anthropic's intentions are to prevent misuse and manipulation, the White House fears that these restrictions may stifle innovation and limit the potential benefits of AI in political engagement.

 The article highlights the tension between promoting responsible AI development and ensuring that AI can be used to enhance democratic processes. It also underscores the challenges in defining and enforcing appropriate guidelines for AI use in politically sensitive contexts. The White House is trying to navigate the balance between fostering innovation and mitigating potential risks, but Anthropic's stringent policies have created friction in this effort.
