  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
  According to a study by academics, Cloudflare's use of Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT) could introduce bias in web performance measurements.
  The issue stems from Cloudflare assigning the same IP address to many users via CGNAT. This can skew performance data because requests from these different users are attributed to the same IP address.
  The study found that this can lead to inaccurate results in speed tests and other web performance evaluations, especially in regions where CGNAT is more prevalent. 
  The academics suggest that Cloudflare and other companies that rely on IP address-based data should be aware of and account for this potential bias in their measurements.
