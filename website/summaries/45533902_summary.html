<p>This article from Open Culture discusses cuneiform, the oldest known writing system. Developed in Mesopotamia, likely by the Sumerians, around 3200 BC, it predates Egyptian hieroglyphs. The name "cuneiform" comes from the Latin word "cuneus," meaning "wedge," referring to the wedge-shaped marks made by pressing a stylus into soft clay tablets. The article outlines the history and evolution of cuneiform, noting its origins in pictographs used for accounting and administration. These early pictographs gradually became more abstract and stylized, eventually evolving into a complex system that could represent not only objects but also sounds and abstract concepts.</p>

<p>Initially, cuneiform was primarily used for recording economic transactions, such as grain rations and property ownership. As the system developed, it expanded to encompass a wider range of subjects, including law, literature, religion, and science. Notable examples include the Code of Hammurabi, one of the oldest known legal codes, and the Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest works of literature. The article highlights the multilingual nature of cuneiform; while it originated with Sumerian, it was later adopted and adapted by other Mesopotamian civilizations, including the Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and Hittites, each using it to write their own languages.</p>

<p>The writing process involved using a stylus, often made of reed, to press wedge-shaped marks into moist clay tablets. These tablets were then dried in the sun or baked, making them durable and preserving the writing for millennia. The complexity of cuneiform required extensive training, and scribes held positions of considerable power and influence in Mesopotamian society. The article touches upon the decipherment of cuneiform in the 19th century, a breakthrough that allowed scholars to unlock a vast trove of historical and cultural information about ancient Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>While cuneiform eventually fell out of use, replaced by alphabetic writing systems, its legacy is significant. It represents a pivotal development in human communication and the preservation of knowledge, providing invaluable insights into the lives, beliefs, and achievements of the people who lived in ancient Mesopotamia. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of cuneiform as a tool for understanding early civilizations and their contributions to human history.</p>
