<p>Norway is reviewing its cybersecurity protocols following the discovery of a hidden remote access feature in electric buses manufactured by the Chinese company Yutong and operated by Unibuss in Oslo. This feature, which could potentially allow unauthorized access to the bus's systems, has raised concerns about espionage and sabotage. The Norwegian National Security Authority (NSM) and the Norwegian Intelligence Service (NIS) are investigating the buses and the potential vulnerabilities they pose.</p>

<p>The remote access feature was discovered during a routine check. While the exact capabilities of the feature are still under investigation, authorities fear that it could allow a third party to access sensitive data, manipulate the bus's functions, or even potentially disrupt the public transportation system. There are also concerns about the potential for location tracking of the buses and surveillance through onboard cameras and microphones.</p>

<p>The concerns are amplified by the geopolitical context, with Norway, a NATO member, sharing a border with Russia and experiencing heightened tensions with China. This discovery underscores the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to foreign interference through seemingly innocuous technology. The NSM and NIS are working to determine the extent of the risk and to develop mitigation strategies. In response to these findings, Unibuss has temporarily suspended software updates on the affected buses. This incident highlights the importance of robust cybersecurity measures, including thorough security audits and supply chain risk assessments, to protect critical infrastructure from potential threats.</p>
