  <p>Llama-Scan is a Python-based open-source tool designed for comprehensive security auditing of smart contracts. It leverages static analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities in Solidity code. The tool outputs its findings in both detailed reports and concise summaries, facilitating efficient vulnerability identification and remediation.</p>

  <p>Key features of Llama-Scan include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Automated Vulnerability Detection:</strong> It automatically scans Solidity code for a wide range of common smart contract vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Static Analysis:</strong> The tool employs static analysis techniques, which analyze the code without executing it, allowing for early detection of potential issues.</li>
    <li><strong>Detailed and Concise Reports:</strong> Llama-Scan generates both comprehensive reports with detailed explanations of identified vulnerabilities and shorter, more focused summaries.</li>
    <li><strong>Customizable Rules:</strong> The tool allows users to customize the rules used for vulnerability detection, enabling them to tailor the analysis to their specific needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Open-Source:</strong> As an open-source project, Llama-Scan is freely available and can be modified and extended by the community.</li>
    <li><strong>Python-Based:</strong> Built using Python, it benefits from the language's extensive libraries and tooling.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Llama-Scan's functionality supports various stages of the smart contract development lifecycle, including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pre-deployment Audits:</strong> Identifying vulnerabilities before the contract is deployed to the blockchain.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous Integration:</strong> Integrating security scans into the development pipeline to automatically check for issues with each code change.</li>
    <li><strong>Security Research:</strong> Analyzing smart contracts to identify new or previously unknown vulnerabilities.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In essence, Llama-Scan provides a valuable resource for developers and security auditors to enhance the security and reliability of smart contracts by automating vulnerability detection and providing detailed insights into potential issues.</p>
