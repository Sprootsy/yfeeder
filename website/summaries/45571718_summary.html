  <p>The article "People Are People, Or Why" discusses the author's perspective on human nature and societal issues, particularly focusing on wealth distribution, success, and the impact of technology. The author contends that inherent human nature plays a significant role in shaping societal outcomes, rather than solely attributing problems to systemic issues. The article critiques the idea that equality of outcome is achievable or even desirable, suggesting that individuals possess varying levels of drive, competence, and luck, which inevitably lead to different levels of success. It also addresses the increasing influence of technology and automation on the job market, as well as the potential consequences of these trends on employment and societal structures.</p>
  
  <p>The author begins by questioning the notion that societal problems can be solved simply by redistributing wealth, arguing that human nature itself often leads to inequality. They suggest that even if resources were initially distributed equally, differences in individual effort, skill, and chance would eventually result in disparities. The article also touches on the concept of meritocracy, acknowledging its imperfections but defending it as a relatively fair system compared to alternatives. It points out that while factors like inherited wealth and privilege can provide advantages, they do not guarantee success, and many individuals achieve success through hard work and determination. The piece then addresses the role of luck in success, acknowledging that it plays a part but emphasizing that it's not the sole determinant.</p>
  
  <p>The article goes on to discuss the impact of technology and automation on the job market, suggesting that many jobs currently performed by humans will eventually be replaced by machines. It raises concerns about the potential consequences of this trend, including mass unemployment and the need for societal adaptation. The author also explores the possibility of a universal basic income (UBI) as a potential solution, but cautions against its potential downsides, such as reduced motivation to work and potential economic instability. Throughout the article, the author emphasizes the importance of understanding human nature in order to develop effective solutions to societal problems. They argue that ignoring the inherent differences in individuals and the role of factors like effort, skill, and luck will lead to flawed policies and unintended consequences.</p>
