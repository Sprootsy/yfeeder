    <h2>Rust&#39;s TUI Revolution</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <p>The provided webpage showcases applications built using the Ratatui library. Ratatui is a Rust library for building rich terminal user interfaces (TUIs). The page serves as a demonstration of the library's capabilities and provides inspiration for developers looking to create terminal-based applications. The showcased applications span a diverse range of use cases, including system monitoring, development tools, and entertainment.</p>

  <p>One application, `bottom`, is a graphical process/system monitor that helps users track resource usage. It displays CPU, memory, network, and disk activity in a visually appealing and informative way. Another application, `bandwhich`, is a terminal bandwidth utilization tool that identifies the processes using network bandwidth. It allows users to quickly pinpoint which applications are consuming the most network resources.</p>

  <p>For developers, `cargo-depgraph` visualizes Cargo dependency graphs directly in the terminal, allowing for easy analysis of crate dependencies. Similarly, `rslint_cli` offers a TUI for the RSLint linter, providing a user-friendly way to identify and fix linting errors in Rust code. `du-dust` is a `du`-like tool but improves upon the original with a more intuitive and visually appealing interface for understanding disk usage.</p>

  <p>For note-taking and organization, `tut` is a terminal utility for creating and managing text snippets. Other utilities such as `kmon` shows kernel telemetry, and `sniffnet` is a network monitoring tool that can be used to analyze network traffic in real-time.</p>

  <p>The showcase also includes tools for managing cloud resources. `kubectl-tui` provides a terminal-based interface for interacting with Kubernetes clusters, making it easier to manage deployments, services, and other Kubernetes resources. There are applications that work with databases as well, with `pgcli` offering a terminal-based client for Postgres.</p>

  <p>Other listed applications include `oxker`, `tui-realm-split-app`, `kdash`, `topgrade`, `rusty-journal`, `corrosion`, `gitui`, `lazygit`, `zenith`, `spotify-tui`, `pocket-cli`, `tui-mines`, `tui-rs-template`, `pocs`, and `pomodoro-cli`. These applications cover a range of functionality including container management, system administration, development workflows, and even gaming. `oxker` is a TUI for Docker, `topgrade` automates updating software on multiple platforms, `gitui` and `lazygit` are TUI clients for Git, and `spotify-tui` provides a terminal-based Spotify client.</p>

  <p>The Ratatui showcase demonstrates the library's versatility and ease of use, enabling developers to create powerful and visually appealing terminal applications across various domains.</p>
