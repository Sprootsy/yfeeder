  <p>
    The article is about `asdf-overlay`, an asdf plugin that enables the management of environment variables for different asdf tools and projects. It allows users to define environment variables within `.env` files or other specified files and automatically load them when an asdf-managed tool is executed within the project directory. This simplifies the process of managing tool-specific configurations and dependencies, especially in projects with varying requirements across different tools or versions. The plugin offers features like automatic `.env` file loading, support for custom environment variable file paths, and integration with asdf's existing workflow for managing tool versions. It helps ensure that the correct environment variables are set for each tool without manual intervention, thus streamlining development workflows and reducing the risk of configuration errors.
