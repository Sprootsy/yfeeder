    <h2>Did &#34;Big Oil&#34; Sell Us on a Recycling Scam?</h2>

<p>This article discusses the history of plastic recycling in the United States and argues that the plastics industry, particularly Big Oil, promoted recycling not as a genuine solution to plastic waste but as a way to maintain and expand plastic production. The article details how, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as public concern about plastic waste grew, the plastics industry launched a large-scale public relations campaign to promote plastic recycling. They formed groups like the Council for Solid Waste Solutions and spent millions of dollars advertising the benefits of recycling. The industry presented plastic recycling as a viable and environmentally responsible solution, deflecting criticism and encouraging consumers and municipalities to invest in recycling programs.</p>

<p>However, the article asserts that the plastics industry knew from the beginning that plastic recycling was not economically or practically viable on a large scale. Many types of plastic are difficult and expensive to recycle, and the resulting recycled plastic is often of lower quality and less valuable than virgin plastic. The industry's internal documents allegedly show that they were aware of these limitations but continued to promote recycling to alleviate public concerns and protect their profits. The article suggests that the industry used the promise of recycling to justify the continued production of single-use plastics, shifting the responsibility for managing plastic waste onto consumers and municipalities while avoiding any reduction in plastic production.</p>

<p>The author contends that the plastics industry successfully convinced the public that plastic recycling was a widespread and effective solution, leading to increased acceptance of plastic products and delaying more meaningful interventions, such as reducing plastic production or developing alternative materials. The article also points out that the low rates of plastic recycling in the US and globally (historically around 9% in the US) demonstrate the failure of this approach. The author concludes that the promotion of plastic recycling was, in effect, a scam that allowed the plastics industry to continue profiting from the production of plastic while misleading the public about the environmental consequences.</p>
