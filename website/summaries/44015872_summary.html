    <h2>Dead Stars Donâ€™t Radiate</h2>

<p>The article discusses the behavior of dead stars, specifically focusing on why they don't radiate energy and shrink indefinitely due to gravity. It explains that while gravity constantly pulls matter inward, there are forces that counteract this collapse in different types of dead stars. The primary focus is on white dwarfs and neutron stars.</p>
<p>For white dwarfs, the Pauli Exclusion Principle, a quantum mechanical principle, prevents electrons from occupying the same quantum state. This creates a pressure known as electron degeneracy pressure. As gravity compresses the white dwarf, the electrons are forced closer together, increasing their momentum and thus the degeneracy pressure. This pressure resists further collapse, eventually balancing the force of gravity and stabilizing the white dwarf. The article notes that there's a limit to how much mass a white dwarf can have (the Chandrasekhar limit, about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun). If a white dwarf exceeds this limit, the electron degeneracy pressure is no longer sufficient to counteract gravity, and the star will collapse further.</p>
<p>When a star collapses beyond the white dwarf stage, electrons combine with protons to form neutrons, and the star becomes a neutron star. In neutron stars, the neutron degeneracy pressure, analogous to electron degeneracy pressure but involving neutrons, halts further collapse. Similar to white dwarfs, there is a limit to the mass a neutron star can sustain (the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, typically around 2-3 solar masses). If this limit is exceeded, the neutron degeneracy pressure is insufficient to prevent further collapse, potentially leading to the formation of a black hole.</p>
<p>The article also touches on the reason why dead stars don't radiate energy and shrink. In a stable white dwarf or neutron star, the degeneracy pressure balances gravity, preventing further contraction. While these stars do radiate some energy (primarily through thermal radiation), this process is slow and doesn't cause significant shrinkage. The key is that the quantum mechanical effects provide a stable equilibrium against gravitational collapse, and the slow radiation of energy doesn't disrupt this equilibrium dramatically.</p>
<p>In essence, the article explains how quantum mechanics plays a crucial role in the stability of dead stars, preventing them from endlessly shrinking under the force of gravity. It highlights the importance of electron and neutron degeneracy pressure in white dwarfs and neutron stars, respectively, and the mass limits beyond which these stars collapse into more exotic objects like black holes.</p>
