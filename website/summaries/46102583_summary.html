<p>The website 23andmedatasetsettlement.com provides information about a proposed settlement in a class action lawsuit against 23andMe, Inc. The lawsuit, titled In re: 23andMe Data Security Litigation, Case No. 3:23-cv-00229-WHO (N.D. Cal.), alleges that 23andMe failed to adequately protect the personal information of its customers, resulting in a data breach. The settlement aims to resolve these claims.</p>

<p>The settlement class includes anyone in the United States who had their 23andMe account registered on or before February 1, 2024, and whose data was compromised in the Data Security Incident announced in October 2023. This includes individuals who had their Genetic Information, Self-Reported Information, or Registered Account Information compromised.</p>

<p>Under the proposed settlement, 23andMe will implement several changes to its data security practices. These changes include enhanced security measures, increased monitoring, and improved data protection protocols. The specific details of these measures are outlined in the settlement agreement.</p>

<p>Settlement class members have several options. They can submit a claim for reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred as a result of the data breach, such as expenses related to identity theft or fraud. They can also claim for lost time spent dealing with the incident. Alternatively, they can opt out of the settlement, which means they will not receive any benefits but retain the right to sue 23andMe individually. They can also object to the settlement if they believe it is unfair, inadequate, or unreasonable.</p>

<p>To receive settlement benefits, class members must submit a valid claim form by a specified deadline. The website provides access to the claim form and instructions on how to complete it. The website also provides information on how to opt out of the settlement or object to its terms, including deadlines for doing so.</p>

<p>The court will hold a final approval hearing to decide whether to approve the settlement. If approved, the settlement will be binding on all class members who did not opt out. The website provides information on the date, time, and location of the final approval hearing.</p>

<p>The website also provides access to important documents related to the settlement, such as the settlement agreement, the court's preliminary approval order, and the class notice. These documents provide more detailed information about the terms of the settlement and the rights of class members.</p>

<p>The settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing by 23andMe. The company denies the allegations but has agreed to the settlement to avoid the costs and risks of litigation.</p>
