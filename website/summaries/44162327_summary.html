<p>This article is a personal account of the author's journey to significantly improve their typing speed, from a relatively slow pace to a reported 118 words per minute (WPM). The author emphasizes that this improvement wasn't due to innate talent or exceptional dexterity, but rather a deliberate and focused effort to rewire their brain and muscle memory through consistent practice and the application of specific techniques.</p>

<p>The author begins by highlighting the importance of typing as a fundamental skill in the modern world, particularly for those who spend a significant amount of time working with computers. Dissatisfied with their initial typing speed, they embarked on a quest to enhance their proficiency. They emphasize that while various online resources and typing tutors exist, the key lies in a dedicated and structured approach to learning.</p>

<p>A core principle of the author's method is the emphasis on accuracy over speed, particularly in the initial stages of learning. They advocate for consciously slowing down to focus on correct finger placement and minimizing errors. The rationale behind this is that accuracy builds a solid foundation upon which speed can be gradually and naturally developed. The author stresses that rushing into typing faster without accuracy leads to ingrained bad habits that are difficult to correct later.</p>

<p>Another crucial element is the practice method. The author did not just blindly practice any text. Instead, they used a carefully selected set of texts and practiced them repeatedly. This allowed them to internalize common letter combinations and words, further accelerating their learning. This deliberate practice is akin to how musicians practice scales and arpeggios to build technical proficiency.</p>

<p>The article also delves into the concept of "brain rewiring" and muscle memory. The author explains that consistent, accurate typing practice gradually establishes new neural pathways in the brain, which in turn automate the process of typing. Over time, the fingers begin to move instinctively and efficiently, reducing the cognitive load required for each keystroke. This frees up mental resources, allowing the typist to focus on the content of their writing rather than the mechanics of typing.</p>

<p>The author also discusses the importance of ergonomics in preventing injuries and promoting comfortable typing. They recommend maintaining a proper posture, using an ergonomic keyboard, and taking frequent breaks to avoid strain on the hands, wrists, and neck. They also highlight the value of typing tests as a means of tracking progress and identifying areas that need improvement.</p>

<p>The article further emphasizes the need for patience and persistence. Improving typing speed is not an overnight process, and the author acknowledges that there were periods of frustration and plateaus. However, by staying committed to the practice regimen and focusing on continuous improvement, they were able to overcome these challenges and achieve their goals. The author highlights the importance of celebrating small wins along the way to stay motivated.</p>

<p>The author shares practical tips, such as using online typing tutors, focusing on problem keys, and visualizing the keyboard layout. They also suggest using a metronome to maintain a consistent typing rhythm. They recommend setting realistic goals and tracking progress to stay motivated. Furthermore, the author stresses the importance of consistency in practice, advocating for short, regular practice sessions rather than infrequent, long sessions.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the article posits that achieving high typing speeds is attainable through dedicated effort and the application of effective learning techniques. The author's experience demonstrates that anyone can significantly improve their typing skills by prioritizing accuracy, practicing deliberately, and fostering a mindset of continuous improvement. It showcases that typing speed improvement is not about natural talent but about strategic training.</p>
