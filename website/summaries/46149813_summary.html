<div>
  <p>The article is a README file for a GitHub repository called "multivox" by AncientJames. Multivox is described as a tool for multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) using a VITS (Variational Inference with adversarial Text-to-Speech) model. It enables users to generate speech in different voices from text input. The README provides instructions for setting up the environment, downloading pre-trained models, and running inference. It outlines the necessary dependencies like Python, Pytorch, and specific libraries listed in `requirements.txt`. The document guides users through installing these dependencies using pip. It emphasizes the importance of downloading appropriate pre-trained VITS models and configuring the paths correctly for inference. Details about running the TTS model are given, including how to specify the text to be spoken and the speaker ID to select the desired voice. The README also presents information on training a VITS model with custom datasets. This includes preparing the data in the appropriate format, which consists of audio files and corresponding text transcriptions. The documentation covers the steps for training the model, including setting up the training configuration and launching the training script. The README provides guidance on how to evaluate the trained model, specifically on checking the loss curves to identify possible issues during training and how to troubleshoot common problems. Furthermore, the document details the process of generating a speaker embedding using an encoder, a crucial step for multi-speaker TTS. The README file includes example commands for different operations, making it easier for users to quickly test the system or fine-tune models. It includes options for generating speech from text with specific speaker IDs, training the model on custom data, and generating speaker embeddings. The overall goal of the multivox project, as described in the README, is to provide a user-friendly and customizable tool for multi-speaker TTS, making it accessible for users with varying levels of expertise to generate realistic speech in different voices. The document aims to provide a comprehensive guide to using the tool, from setting up the environment to training and evaluating the model.
