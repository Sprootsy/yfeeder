<p>The article discusses the phenomenon of "shrinkflation" affecting boxed cake mixes, where the size of the mix has decreased over time while the price remains the same or even increases. It highlights that the standard boxed cake mix size has shrunk from 18.25 ounces to approximately 15.25 ounces in many cases. The author notes that this change impacts recipes designed for the original size, potentially leading to altered results if bakers aren't aware of the reduction. They also mention the confusion caused by the lack of clear labeling indicating the reduced size, and some brands have even gone below 15 ounces. The article emphasizes the importance of checking the box's weight and adjusting recipes accordingly to avoid undesirable outcomes like dry or dense cakes. It also touches upon the fact that frosting sizes have also decreased.
