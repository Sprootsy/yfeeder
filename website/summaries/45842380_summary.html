    <h2>IRS halts Direct File and points to other free services</h2>

 <p>The IRS's Direct File program, which allowed taxpayers in 12 states to file their taxes directly with the IRS for free, has been permanently authorized following a pilot program. The IRS hailed the program as a success, noting high user satisfaction and cost-effectiveness. However, tax-preparation companies like Intuit (TurboTax) and H&amp;R Block, who dominate the tax preparation software market, have lobbied against the program, arguing it duplicates existing services and could be expanded beyond simple tax situations.</p>
 

 <p>The Direct File pilot program was launched after the Inflation Reduction Act allocated \$15 million to study the feasibility of a free, government-run tax filing system. The IRS found that the pilot was successful, with the majority of users reporting a positive experience and finding the tool easy to use. The program was available to taxpayers in Arizona, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming who had relatively simple tax situations, such as those with income from wages, salaries, Social Security, and limited deductions like the standard deduction and the earned income tax credit.</p>
 

 <p>Proponents of Direct File argue that it offers a free, simple, and trustworthy alternative to commercial tax preparation software, potentially saving taxpayers time and money. They also contend that it increases competition in the tax preparation market, potentially driving down prices for all taxpayers. The Biden administration has strongly supported the program, citing its potential to make tax filing easier and more affordable for millions of Americans. The Treasury Department has emphasized that the program will be continuously improved based on user feedback and data analysis.</p>
 

 <p>Opponents, primarily tax preparation companies, express concerns that Direct File duplicates existing free services offered by the private sector, such as the IRS Free File program, which partners with commercial providers to offer free filing to eligible taxpayers. They also worry that the IRS, as both tax collector and tax preparer, could face conflicts of interest. These companies have spent considerable sums lobbying against the expansion of Direct File, arguing that it could eventually expand to cover more complex tax situations, disadvantaging those who rely on their services.</p>
 

 <p>The debate over Direct File highlights the long-standing tension between government efforts to simplify tax filing and the interests of the private tax preparation industry. The future of Direct File will likely depend on continued political support, user adoption, and the IRS's ability to address concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the scope of the program.</p>
