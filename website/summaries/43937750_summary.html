The article reports on the death of retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter at the age of 84 due to complications from cancer. Souter, nominated by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, was known for his moderate conservatism upon appointment but evolved into a reliably liberal voice on the Court.
</p>
<p>
His confirmation was initially smooth, but his jurisprudence shifted over time, disappointing some conservatives who had anticipated a consistent right-leaning vote. He became a crucial part of the liberal bloc, often siding with Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, John Paul Stevens, and Stephen Breyer.

<p>
Souter was a deeply private individual who eschewed the trappings of Washington society, preferring a simple life and eventually retiring to his home state of New Hampshire. He was known for his rigorous intellect, independent thinking, and commitment to the rule of law. His opinions were often scholarly and reflected a deep understanding of legal history and precedent.

He retired in 2009 and was replaced by Justice Sonia Sotomayor.
