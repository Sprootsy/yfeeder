   According to a new study published on August 31, 2025, in the journal
   <i>eLife</i>, researchers have made a significant discovery about the function of
   sleep. Contrary to previous beliefs that sleep primarily serves to conserve
   energy, the study suggests that its primary purpose is to allow the brain to
   reorganize and consolidate memories.
  </p>
  <p>
   The research team, led by Dr. Emily Carter at the University of California,
   Berkeley, used advanced neuroimaging techniques to monitor brain activity in
   participants during both wakefulness and sleep. They focused on analyzing the
   patterns of neural connections, specifically looking at how these connections
   changed over time. The study involved a group of 30 healthy adults who underwent
   a series of learning tasks followed by periods of sleep. Their brain activity
   was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) both before and
   after sleep.

  <p>
   The findings revealed that during sleep, the brain actively strengthens the
   connections between neurons that were used during the learning tasks. This
   process, known as synaptic consolidation, is crucial for long-term memory
   formation. Furthermore, the researchers observed that sleep helped to prune
   weaker, less relevant connections, making the memory networks more efficient and
   less susceptible to interference.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dr. Carter explained that while energy conservation does occur during sleep, the
   data clearly indicates that the reorganization of neural circuits is the
   dominant function. She stated that this discovery has significant implications
   for understanding learning and memory disorders, as well as developing
   strategies to improve cognitive function. The study also sheds light on why sleep
   deprivation can impair cognitive performance. When the brain doesn't get enough
   sleep, it cannot effectively consolidate memories, leading to difficulty in
   learning and retaining new information.
  </p>
  <p>
   The researchers are now planning to investigate how different stages of sleep
   contribute to specific aspects of memory consolidation. They are also exploring
   the potential of using targeted brain stimulation techniques during sleep to
   enhance memory formation in individuals with cognitive impairments.
