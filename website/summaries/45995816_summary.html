LionsOS is based on a simplified version of Unix V6 and is intended to be used in operating systems courses. The purpose of LionsOS is to present a complete, albeit simplified, operating system to students, allowing them to understand the core components and interactions within such systems. It serves as a practical tool to complement theoretical knowledge by enabling students to explore and modify actual OS code. The material includes the source code of LionsOS, along with extensive commentary and explanations, making it accessible for educational purposes. The OS source code is available for download.</p>
