    <h2>Do YC after you graduate: Early decision for students</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>The Y Combinator (YC) Early Decision program offers applicants the opportunity to receive an admission decision to the YC accelerator program earlier than the regular application deadline. Applying Early Decision is designed for startups that are highly confident in their application and would commit to joining YC if accepted. The primary benefit is knowing your outcome sooner, which can help with planning whether to continue working on the startup, pursue other opportunities, or re-apply to YC later.
</p>
<p>The Early Decision application is identical to the regular YC application, but there is a shorter timeframe for submission and review. Early Decision applications are reviewed before the regular applicant pool. If accepted through Early Decision, startups are expected to commit to the YC batch. If rejected, applicants can still re-apply in the regular round, taking advantage of the feedback received during the Early Decision process to improve their application. However, the information on how to re-apply is not specifically mentioned in the article.
</p>
<p>The article emphasizes that applying Early Decision should only be considered if a startup is genuinely ready to join YC immediately, as backing out after acceptance is strongly discouraged. This is because accepting an offer in Early Decision means you're occupying a slot that could have been given to another startup.
