   According to a classified intelligence assessment, if Iran were to imminently enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels, the US would likely conduct military strikes against Iranian nuclear sites. This assessment, which has been shared with key members of Congress and the Biden administration, outlines the potential consequences of such action, including a wider regional conflict. While Iran currently denies intending to produce nuclear weapons, its increased enrichment activities have raised international concerns.
  </p>
  <p>
   The intelligence community believes that military action would set back Iran's nuclear program, but it would not eliminate it entirely. Iran could potentially rebuild its nuclear infrastructure in the future, especially if the underlying reasons for pursuing nuclear weapons capability are not addressed.
  </p>
  <p>
   The assessment details several possible Iranian responses to a US strike, including direct attacks on US forces in the region, cyberattacks, and proxy attacks through groups like Hezbollah. It also suggests that Iran might attempt to disrupt global oil supplies through the Strait of Hormuz.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Biden administration has repeatedly stated its commitment to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and has kept military options on the table, though it prefers a diplomatic solution. The assessment serves as a reminder of the high stakes involved and the potential for escalation in the region.
  </p>
  <p>
   The assessment also takes into account the views of Israel, which has long viewed Iran's nuclear program as an existential threat. Israel has previously conducted covert operations against Iran's nuclear facilities and is believed to have the capability to carry out a military strike independently, though it would prefer US involvement.
  </p>
  <p>
   The potential for a military confrontation with Iran is a complex and sensitive issue, with the intelligence assessment aiming to provide policymakers with a clear understanding of the risks and potential outcomes. The assessment highlights the need for a comprehensive strategy that addresses not only Iran's nuclear program but also the broader regional security dynamics.
