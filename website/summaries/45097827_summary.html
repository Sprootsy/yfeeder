    This article is a nostalgic reflection on the author's fondness for the em dash and its stylistic absence in contemporary digital writing. The author begins by describing the em dash as a versatile and expressive punctuation mark, capable of indicating interruption, providing emphasis, or adding supplementary information. They enjoyed using it frequently in their personal and professional writing, feeling it added character and nuance.

    However, the author observes that the em dash seems to have fallen out of favor, particularly in online content. They attribute this decline to several potential factors. One is the influence of platforms like Twitter (now X) and texting, which prioritize brevity and often discourage more complex punctuation. Another is the general trend toward simplified and streamlined writing, aimed at improving readability and accessibility for a wider audience. The author also notes that some style guides and editors may discourage the frequent use of em dashes, considering them potentially distracting or informal.

    The author laments the loss of the em dash, arguing that its absence contributes to a certain blandness and uniformity in online writing. They feel that it provided a way to add personality and flair to their work, and that its replacement with simpler punctuation marks like commas or parentheses results in a less engaging and expressive style. They acknowledge the practical reasons for the em dash's decline but still miss its distinctive presence and the unique voice it allowed them to cultivate. Despite the shifting landscape of online writing, the author retains a soft spot for the em dash and its expressive potential. The article serves as a gentle call for writers to reconsider the value of this often-overlooked punctuation mark and perhaps find ways to reintroduce it into their writing.
