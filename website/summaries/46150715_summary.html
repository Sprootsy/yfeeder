<p>The article discusses the increasing number of students at Stanford University who identify as having a disability. According to data from the university's Office of Accessible Education (OAE), 38% of Stanford students now claim to have a disability, a significant increase from previous years. The author explores potential reasons behind this surge, including changes in diagnostic criteria, increased awareness and destigmatization of disabilities, and strategic motivations for students to seek accommodations and resources. The article highlights that a large portion of these disabilities are related to mental health, such as anxiety and depression, or learning differences like ADHD.

The author raises questions about whether the expanding definition of disability and the increased availability of accommodations are leading to over-identification and potentially undermining the value of these resources for students with more severe needs. There's concern that some students might be seeking diagnoses primarily to gain advantages in the competitive academic environment, such as extended time on exams or reduced course loads. The article points out the potential for "strategic disability," where students leverage disability services to enhance their academic performance or manage the pressures of a demanding university.

The article also touches on the broader societal trend of increasing mental health diagnoses among young people. It questions whether universities are adequately equipped to handle the growing demand for mental health services and academic accommodations. The author suggests a need for a more nuanced understanding of disability and a careful examination of the impact of accommodations on both students with genuine needs and the overall academic integrity of the institution. The article concludes by posing questions about the long-term implications of this trend and the potential for universities to better support students while maintaining high academic standards.</p>
