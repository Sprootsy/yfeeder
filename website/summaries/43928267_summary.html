<h3>Summary:</h3>
The article discusses a controversy at Uber dubbed "Shower-gate." The author claims that Uber's legal team allegedly instructed employees to delete internal communications related to ongoing lawsuits and investigations. The core issue revolves around the use of ephemeral messaging apps (likely Signal or similar encrypted platforms) and the alleged deliberate destruction of evidence, potentially obstructing justice. The author goes on to say that the company's legal team allegedly encouraged employees to use these apps for sensitive communications, knowing that the messages would automatically disappear, and then instructed people to delete these communications when legal requests for them were made. The anonymous poster on Blind, seemingly an insider, expresses concern over the ethical and legal implications of such actions, suggesting potential obstruction of justice and legal exposure for both the company and the individuals involved.

The post emphasizes the potential severity of these allegations, highlighting the risk of fines, sanctions, and even criminal charges if proven true. It also implies a culture of prioritizing company interests over ethical considerations and legal compliance. The discussion on Blind reflects a broader anxiety among tech employees regarding the ethical responsibilities of their roles and the potential for conflicts between corporate objectives and legal/moral obligations. The post then calls on Uber's leaders, including Dara Khosrowshahi, to take appropriate action.
