<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>
According to The Hill article, Republican lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee are scrutinizing Wikipedia for potential political bias. They have voiced concerns that the online encyclopedia, a widely used source of information, might be presenting information in a way that unfairly favors certain political viewpoints over others.
</p>
<p>
The probe was initiated by Representative Jim Jordan, the ranking member of the committee, who sent a letter to the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that operates Wikipedia. In the letter, Jordan requested documents and communications related to Wikipedia's content moderation policies, specifically focusing on how these policies are applied to politically sensitive topics.

Republicans are worried about the neutrality of Wikipedia's content, pointing to instances where they believe conservative viewpoints have been unfairly censored or misrepresented. They are also concerned about the potential influence of Wikipedia's editors and administrators, who they suspect may have their own political agendas that could affect the site's content.

<p>
The investigation aims to determine whether Wikipedia's content moderation practices are neutral and objective, or if they are influenced by political bias. The lawmakers are seeking to ensure that Wikipedia remains a reliable and unbiased source of information for the public.

The Wikimedia Foundation has stated that it is committed to neutrality and that its content is governed by community-developed policies. The foundation has also said that it is willing to cooperate with the committee's inquiry.
