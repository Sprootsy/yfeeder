    <h2>California&#39;s Corporate Cover-Up Act Is a Privacy Nightmare</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) article discusses California's Assembly Bill 2486, also known as the "Corporate Cover Act," raising concerns about its potential impact on privacy. The EFF argues that the bill, purportedly aimed at protecting children online, could instead create a broad exception to California's existing privacy laws, specifically the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA).
</p>
<p>
The core of the issue lies in the bill's proposed amendment to allow companies to collect, use, and retain personal information of individuals under 18 if they have a "reasonable belief" that doing so is necessary to prevent or respond to suspected illegal or harmful conduct, or to protect the safety and well-being of the child or other individuals. The EFF contends that this "reasonable belief" standard is dangerously vague and could be easily exploited by companies to justify widespread data collection and retention practices that would otherwise be prohibited by the CCPA/CPRA.
</p>
<p>
The EFF fears that the bill would incentivize companies to collect more data on children, rather than less, under the guise of protecting them. The broad exception could allow companies to profile children, track their online activities, and retain this data indefinitely, even if there is no actual evidence of harmful conduct. The article also highlights concerns that the bill does not adequately define "harmful conduct," leaving room for interpretation and potential abuse.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, the EFF criticizes the bill for potentially undermining the CCPA/CPRA's core principles of data minimization and purpose limitation. The CCPA/CPRA requires companies to collect only the personal information that is necessary for a specific purpose and to retain it only for as long as necessary. The "Corporate Cover Act," according to the EFF, would create a loophole that allows companies to bypass these requirements by claiming a need to protect children.
</p>
<p>
The article argues that the bill's focus on data collection and retention is misplaced and that there are other, more effective ways to protect children online, such as stricter enforcement of existing laws, promoting digital literacy, and providing resources for parents and educators. The EFF urges California lawmakers to reject the "Corporate Cover Act" and instead focus on policies that genuinely protect children's privacy without undermining the broader privacy rights of all Californians.
