    <h2>Chat Control Must Be Stopped</h2>

  <p>The article argues against the implementation of "Chat Control," a proposed EU regulation aimed at combating child sexual abuse material (CSAM) online. The author contends that Chat Control, which involves scanning private communications for CSAM, poses a significant threat to privacy and freedom of expression, and is technically flawed.</p>
  
  <p>The article explains that Chat Control would require messaging providers to implement scanning technologies to detect CSAM in users' private messages, images, and videos. This would involve the use of hash matching (comparing known CSAM hashes against user content) and potentially AI-based content analysis to identify new or obfuscated CSAM. The data protection authority has confirmed that detecting grooming will be part of the project.</p>
  
  <p>The author raises several concerns about the proposal. First, it argues that Chat Control creates a surveillance infrastructure that could be expanded to monitor other forms of illegal or undesirable content, leading to mass surveillance. Second, the article questions the accuracy of the scanning technologies, arguing that they are prone to false positives, which could lead to wrongful accusations and privacy violations. Third, it raises concerns about the security of the scanning process itself, suggesting that it could be exploited by malicious actors to gain access to private communications or to plant illegal content on users' devices. Fourth, the impact on end-to-end encryption is discussed, emphasizing that Chat Control would either break or weaken encryption, undermining the security of communications for everyone.</p>
  
  <p>The article emphasizes that the proposal is based on the idea of generalized suspicion, treating all users as potential criminals. It also says that Chat Control is incompatible with the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights, which guarantees the right to privacy and freedom of expression. The article also points to potential for abuse, as the scanning technologies could be used to suppress dissent or target vulnerable groups. Further, the article says that Chat Control would have a chilling effect on free speech, as people would be less likely to express themselves freely online if they knew their communications were being monitored.</p>

  <p>The author concludes that Chat Control is a dangerous and disproportionate measure that would undermine fundamental rights and freedoms. The article urges readers to oppose the proposal and to advocate for alternative solutions that protect children without sacrificing privacy and security.</p>
