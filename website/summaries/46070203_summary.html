<p>GitLab discovered a widespread supply chain attack targeting npm (Node Package Manager) users. The attack involved malicious code being injected into multiple npm packages with the intent of stealing environment variables and other sensitive information. The compromised packages included popular ones, potentially impacting a large number of developers and projects. The malicious code was designed to execute upon installation of the package, gathering environment variables (such as those containing API keys, passwords, and other secrets) and sending them to a remote server controlled by the attackers. GitLab's security team identified the malicious packages, analyzed the code, and reported their findings to npm. The packages were subsequently removed from the npm registry. The attack highlights the vulnerability of software supply chains and the importance of security measures to prevent the introduction and propagation of malicious code through open-source package repositories.</p>
