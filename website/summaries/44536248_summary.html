  <p>The article is a personal reflection by Mike Hall on his experience creating a demo for the demoscene on an Amiga 500. He expresses immense pride in this 128-kilobyte creation, more so than in any of his subsequent professional achievements in software development. The author describes the demoscene as a subculture of computer enthusiasts who push the limits of hardware to create impressive audio-visual presentations, often under severe size constraints. The focus is on artistic and technical excellence, achieved through clever programming tricks and deep understanding of the target platform.</p>
  <p>Hall recounts the challenges and rewards of working within the Amiga 500's limitations, including its Motorola 68000 processor, limited memory, and custom chips for graphics and sound. He highlights the collaborative nature of demogroup work, involving coding, graphics, and music. He emphasizes the satisfaction derived from squeezing every last bit of performance from the hardware to realize a shared artistic vision. The author contrasts this experience with his later work in commercial software development, where larger teams, looser constraints, and different priorities often lead to less personal investment and a diminished sense of accomplishment. He acknowledges that modern software projects can be technically complex and impactful, but they often lack the same degree of artistic expression and personal ownership found in demoscene creations.</p>
  <p>The article reflects a sense of nostalgia for a time when software development was more closely tied to the hardware, requiring a deep understanding of its inner workings. It celebrates the ingenuity and creativity of demoscene programmers who were able to achieve remarkable results with limited resources. The author suggests that the constraints of the demoscene fostered a unique form of innovation and collaboration that is rarely found in modern software development. He ends by reaffirming his pride in his demoscene work, seeing it as a testament to the power of creativity, technical skill, and teamwork.</p>
