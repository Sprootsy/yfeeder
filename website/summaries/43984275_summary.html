    <h2>U.S. nuclear base hidden under Greenland&#39;s ice for decades</h2>

The Wall Street Journal article discusses the legacy of Camp Century, a Cold War-era U.S. military base constructed in Greenland in the late 1950s. Built under the guise of a scientific research facility, the camp's true purpose was to assess the feasibility of Project Iceworm, a secret plan to deploy hundreds of nuclear missiles within the Greenland ice sheet, aimed at the Soviet Union. The project was ultimately deemed impractical due to the unpredictable nature of the ice, and Camp Century was abandoned in 1967.
</p>
<p>
However, the base's abandonment has left behind a significant environmental problem. The melting ice sheet, accelerated by climate change, is now threatening to release the waste and infrastructure buried within the ice. This includes not only construction debris and potentially radioactive waste from a nuclear reactor that powered the base, but also significant amounts of diesel fuel and other contaminants.
</p>
<p>
The Danish government, which granted the U.S. permission to build the base under the condition that it was for scientific purposes, is now grappling with the potential fallout. The U.S. maintains that it has no legal obligation to clean up the site, as it was built under a treaty from the Cold War era, and conditions have changed drastically with the effects of climate change. This position has created tension between the U.S. and Denmark.

<p>
The situation highlights the complex geopolitical and environmental challenges posed by climate change in the Arctic. The melting ice is not only revealing Cold War secrets but also raising questions of responsibility for environmental remediation in a region where international agreements and historical understandings are being upended by the rapid pace of climate change. The article emphasizes the potential for further thawing and release of the contaminants and highlights the scientific community's concerns about the long-term impacts on the environment and potentially, human health. The cleanup costs are expected to be very high.
</p>
<p>
The article also touches upon the broader implications of the Camp Century case, including the need for international cooperation to address environmental issues arising from abandoned Cold War sites in the Arctic and the legal and ethical obligations of nations regarding environmental damage caused by past activities in the context of a changing climate.
