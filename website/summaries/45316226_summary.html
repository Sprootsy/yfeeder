    This Axios article reports on a potential plan by Donald Trump, should he win the 2024 presidential election, to enact a policy to end automatic U.S. residency for foreign graduates of U.S. colleges and universities. The focus is on revamping the H-1B visa program and related immigration pathways.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article details how Trump advisors are considering measures to deny visas to foreign graduates and thus compelling them to return to their home countries after graduation. The reasoning behind this is to make America more self-sufficient and to prevent American jobs from being taken by foreign workers. They believe that the current system allows for the displacement of American workers and the exploitation of foreign labor.

  <p>
    The proposal entails stricter enforcement of existing immigration laws and potential new executive actions or legislative pushes to modify the rules around student visas and work permits. Some advisors argue that the current system acts as an incentive for foreign nationals to remain in the U.S., even if their skills aren't necessarily in high demand or if they are willing to accept lower wages than their American counterparts.

  <p>
    The article notes that this policy shift would be a significant departure from the current approach, which often sees international students and graduates as potential contributors to the U.S. economy and innovation ecosystem. Universities and businesses often lobby for more lenient immigration policies to attract and retain global talent.

    The article includes perspectives from sources familiar with the discussions, however, the specifics of the policies are still being fleshed out and could change. The article also mentions potential legal challenges that could arise from such a policy change, as well as the potential economic consequences of limiting the inflow of skilled foreign workers.

    The potential changes reflect a broader agenda within Trump's circle to prioritize American workers and reduce overall immigration levels. This position resonates with some segments of the American population but is strongly opposed by others who view immigration as a source of economic growth and cultural enrichment.
