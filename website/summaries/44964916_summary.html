    Zed is a high-performance, multiplayer code editor being developed by the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter. It is designed for collaborative coding and aims to provide a smooth and efficient editing experience. The editor is built in Rust and leverages technologies like WebGL for rendering and Tree-sitter for syntax parsing.
  </p>
  <p>
    The editor emphasizes real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to work on the same code simultaneously with low latency.  Its architecture is designed to support this functionality efficiently.

  <p>
    Zed is still in early stages of development, but is publicly available on GitHub under a proprietary license with some components being open source.
