   A California jury has ordered Tesla to pay $329 million in damages in connection to a fatal crash that occurred in 2018 involving its Autopilot system. The lawsuit was filed by the family of Micah Lee, who was killed when his Tesla Model 3, operating on Autopilot, veered off course and crashed into a palm tree in Corona, California.
  </p>
  <p>
   The jury found Tesla 1% negligent, while the driver 90% negligent, and the company was responsible for 9% of the damages. The breakdown of the award includes $296.5 million for pain and suffering, $3 million for loss of consortium, and $30 million for loss of future earnings. The plaintiffs argued that Tesla knew its Autopilot system was defective and prone to causing accidents but failed to warn consumers adequately. Evidence presented during the trial included internal Tesla documents and expert testimony suggesting the company was aware of Autopilot's limitations and potential dangers.

  <p>
   Tesla defended itself by arguing that Autopilot is not a fully self-driving system and that drivers are always responsible for maintaining control of their vehicles. The company also pointed to evidence suggesting that Lee may have been distracted or inattentive at the time of the crash.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is one of the first cases involving a fatal crash where Tesla has been found liable for damages related to its Autopilot system.
