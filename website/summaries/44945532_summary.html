  <p>The Obsidian article "Bases" describes the fundamental building blocks and concepts that users need to understand to effectively use the Obsidian application. It covers topics ranging from basic file and folder structure within a vault to more advanced concepts like linking and embedding notes, and utilizing Markdown for formatting.</p>

  <p>The article starts by explaining the concept of a <strong>vault</strong>, which is essentially a folder on your computer that contains all your Obsidian notes and attachments. Obsidian treats this folder as a self-contained knowledge base. The organization within the vault is based on files and folders, reflecting the file system of your operating system. The article emphasizes that users have complete control over this organization.</p>

  <p>Obsidian uses <strong>Markdown</strong> as its primary formatting language. The article doesn't provide a comprehensive Markdown tutorial but assumes a basic understanding. It highlights that Markdown allows for rich text formatting using simple syntax, enabling users to create headings, lists, bold/italic text, links, and more, all while maintaining plain text readability.</p>

  <p>A central theme of Obsidian is the concept of <strong>linking notes</strong>. The article details how to create internal links between notes within the vault using double square brackets <code>[[note name]]</code>. This creates a network of interconnected thoughts and ideas.  It also explains how Obsidian automatically updates these links when a note is renamed, preserving the integrity of the knowledge graph.  Links can also point to headings within notes using <code>[[note name#heading]]</code>.</p>

  <p><strong>Embedding notes</strong> is another important feature discussed.  Embedding allows you to display the content of one note directly within another. This is achieved by using an exclamation point before the double square brackets: <code>![[note name]]</code>.  Embedding can include entire notes or specific sections (headings or blocks) of notes.  Embedded notes are live and update dynamically if the source note is changed. This allows for creating dynamic dashboards and summaries.</p>

  <p>The article also touches upon <strong>attachments</strong>. Users can link to or embed files such as images and PDFs within their notes. This allows for incorporating multimedia and other relevant resources into the knowledge base. The syntax for embedding images is <code>![[image.png]]</code>.</p>

  <p>Finally, the article briefly mentions the <strong>graph view</strong>, which visually represents the connections between notes. The graph view can be used to explore the network of ideas within the vault and identify patterns or connections that might not be obvious from simply browsing the file system. The graph view is a powerful tool for knowledge discovery and exploration within Obsidian.</p>
