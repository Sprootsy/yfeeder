<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The EasyRV project aims to provide a simplified and easy-to-understand introduction to the RISC-V architecture, particularly for those who are new to computer architecture or hardware design. It focuses on creating a minimal, yet complete, RISC-V processor core named “TinyRV1” using Verilog HDL. The project's goal is to offer a clear and concise learning experience by stripping away unnecessary complexities often found in more advanced or commercial designs. It emphasizes educational value by using a clean coding style, providing detailed documentation, and offering step-by-step tutorials.</p>

<p>The project breaks down the development of the TinyRV1 processor into manageable stages, starting with basic components and gradually adding complexity. It covers essential aspects of processor design, including the instruction set architecture (ISA), datapath, control logic, memory interface, and testing methodologies. The tutorials guide users through implementing fundamental RISC-V instructions and understanding the data flow within the processor. By the end of the project, users will have a functional RISC-V processor core that can execute simple programs.</p>

<p>EasyRV also emphasizes the importance of verification and testing. It includes test benches and simulation scripts to ensure the correctness of the design. Users learn how to write assembly programs, compile them into machine code, and then run these programs on their simulated TinyRV1 processor. The project encourages experimentation and modification, allowing users to explore different design choices and optimizations. It provides a solid foundation for further exploration into more advanced topics in computer architecture and digital design. The project is also open-source, encouraging collaboration and community contributions.</p>
