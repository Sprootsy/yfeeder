<h2>Summary</h2>
The article "Don't Download Apps" by Caleb Jay argues that downloading native mobile applications is often unnecessary and detrimental to the user experience. The author posits that web applications (PWAs), which are websites designed to function and appear like native apps, offer a superior alternative in many cases.

The central argument revolves around the idea that native apps, while seemingly convenient, come with significant drawbacks. These include taking up storage space on the device, requiring constant updates, and often requesting excessive permissions that compromise user privacy. Additionally, the author highlights the friction involved in discovering, downloading, and installing native apps, which contrasts sharply with the ease of accessing a website.

Caleb Jay emphasizes the benefits of PWAs. PWAs can be accessed instantly through a web browser, without installation. PWAs consume minimal storage space, update automatically, and can offer comparable functionality to native apps, including push notifications and offline access. The author claims that many tasks traditionally associated with native apps, such as social media, reading news, and even complex applications like photo editing, can be effectively accomplished through PWAs.

The article also addresses the perception that native apps offer a smoother, more integrated user experience. While acknowledging that this may have been true in the past, the author argues that modern web technologies have largely closed the gap, allowing PWAs to deliver near-native performance and features.

Furthermore, the author points out that the app ecosystem is dominated by a few large companies (Apple and Google), which control app distribution and impose restrictions on developers. By contrast, PWAs are inherently more open and decentralized, fostering innovation and competition. The author encourages users to reconsider their default behavior of downloading apps and to explore the possibilities of PWAs as a more convenient, privacy-friendly, and efficient alternative. The article advocates for a shift in mindset towards utilizing the web for mobile experiences whenever possible, reserving native apps for cases where they offer truly unique or essential functionality.
