    <h2>NSF plans end to lone U.S. Antarctic research icebreaker</h2>

<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) plans to discontinue the use of its only U.S. Antarctic research icebreaker, the Nathaniel B. Palmer, when its contract expires in March 2025. This decision comes despite scientists' concerns about the vessel's importance for polar research. The NSF justifies this decision by stating that it has cost more than anticipated to keep the ship in service and that other icebreakers are available for use. The ship is owned by Edison Chouest Offshore (ECO), and the NSF has chartered the ship for over three decades.</p>

<p>The NSF states that it has invested over \$500 million on the vessel since the late 1980s. They are hoping to potentially replace the vessel with a newer one as early as 2030. The NSF also says that other icebreakers owned by other countries can be used to conduct the same research. There are scientists who believe that these ships will not be able to provide the same capabilities as the Nathaniel B. Palmer. The Palmer is unique in that it is able to navigate the most difficult parts of the Antarctic, with its ability to break ice of up to 3 feet thick. The Palmer is also able to travel to specific research locations.</p>

<p>The scientific community has expressed worries about the impact of losing the Nathaniel B. Palmer, particularly regarding the ability to conduct crucial research in the Antarctic. The Palmer has been instrumental in studies such as the Thwaites Glacier, which could significantly impact sea levels if it melts. The vessel has provided a platform for scientists to study ocean acidification, marine ecosystems, and the stability of ice shelves. The NSF's decision comes amid a growing need for polar research, fueled by concerns about climate change and its effects on the polar regions. Scientists worry about the reliance on foreign icebreakers, as the availability of these vessels may not align with the needs and schedules of U.S. researchers. The NSF says they will continue to work with the scientific community to find options for Antarctic research.</p>
