This change in strategy comes after concerns were raised regarding the increasing number of bugs and glitches in recent iOS versions. Apple is reportedly implementing several measures to address these issues and ensure a more stable and reliable user experience.</p>

<p>One of the primary changes involves a more rigorous testing process. Apple plans to allocate more time and resources to internal testing, as well as expand its beta testing program to include a wider range of users.

Efforts are being made to promote better collaboration and communication between different teams working on iOS, ensuring that all aspects of the operating system work seamlessly together.</p>
