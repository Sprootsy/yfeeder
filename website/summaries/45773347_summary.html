  <p>Summary:</p>
  <p>The article discusses a pattern of behavior observed in web traffic, where AI scrapers are requesting JavaScript files that contain comments. These comments often include instructions, explanations, or even API keys, which the AI scrapers are apparently using to understand and interact with the website. The author noticed that several requests were targeting specific JavaScript files known to contain sensitive information, such as API keys, internal documentation, or instructions on how the website functions. These requests originated from IP addresses associated with AI scraper services. The author speculates that these AI scrapers are becoming more sophisticated in their ability to parse and understand JavaScript code, including comments, allowing them to extract valuable information and potentially exploit websites in more effective ways. The author suggests that web developers should be aware of this trend and take steps to secure their websites by removing sensitive information from JavaScript comments, obfuscating code, and implementing stricter access controls. The author also suggests looking at other types of files requested by AI scrapers such as `.env` files.</p>
