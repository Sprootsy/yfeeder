According to a MarketWatch article, dormant Bitcoin wallets dating back to Bitcoin's early days have recently become active, transferring significant amounts of Bitcoin. These wallets, some untouched for as long as 14 years, have moved Bitcoin valued at approximately $2 billion. The activity has drawn attention within the cryptocurrency community, sparking speculation about the motivations and identities of the wallet owners.

The article highlights the mystery surrounding these "Sleeping Beauty" wallets. Because of Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature, it's difficult to determine who controls them or why they are suddenly being used after such a long period of inactivity. Some speculate that these wallets belong to early adopters who mined Bitcoin when it was relatively worthless and are now taking advantage of its increased value. Others suggest that they might be linked to individuals or entities involved in illicit activities who are now trying to cash out their holdings.

The movement of these large amounts of Bitcoin could potentially impact the market. Depending on how the owners choose to sell or use their Bitcoin, it could increase selling pressure and potentially drive down the price. However, the overall impact is uncertain, as the cryptocurrency market is influenced by a multitude of factors.
