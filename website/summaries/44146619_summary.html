<p>George E. Smith, a Nobel Prize winner and co-inventor of the charge-coupled device (CCD), a sensor that transformed photography and enabled digital imaging, died on May 28 at the age of 94 in Galloway, New Jersey. His death was confirmed by his daughter, Alison Smith.
</p>
<p>
Smith, along with Willard Boyle, invented the CCD at Bell Labs in 1969. This invention replaced the need for film in cameras and had broad applications beyond photography, including in medical imaging, astronomy, and other scientific fields. The CCD works by converting light into electrical signals, which are then processed to create an image.

Smith's career at Bell Labs spanned several decades, beginning in 1959. He initially worked on semiconductor memory devices. The invention of the CCD came about during a period when Bell Labs was exploring new memory technologies. The device was initially seen as a potential memory storage solution before its imaging capabilities were fully realized.

<p>
In 2009, Smith and Boyle were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their invention. The Nobel committee highlighted the CCD as a revolutionary technology that had a significant impact on various fields.

<p>
George Smith was born in White Plains, New York, and grew up in Annapolis, Maryland. He served in the Navy during World War II. He received his bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania and his doctorate from the University of Chicago.
