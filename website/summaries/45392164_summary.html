<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The article is a comprehensive history and overview of Infocom, a software company best known for its text-adventure games. It begins by detailing the company's origins in the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science in the late 1970s. A group of programmers, primarily working on the Dynamic Modelling System (DMS), sought to commercialize their expertise. Initially, they explored database software but transitioned to interactive fiction due to its more immediate market potential and their existing skills in programming languages and natural language processing. The name "Infocom" was chosen to reflect their initial focus on information and communication.</p>

<p>The article describes how Infocom's text adventures, such as Zork, were revolutionary for their time. These games were not simply "choose your own adventure" stories but complex simulations that allowed players to interact with the game world through natural language commands. The company developed its own Z-machine to make their games portable, as computers were not standardized.</p>

<p>The article details Infocom's early successes, with games like Zork, Deadline, and Starcross becoming commercial hits. Infocom cultivated a sophisticated and intellectual image, attracting a loyal fanbase. They emphasized storytelling, puzzle design, and quality writing.</p>

<p>The article discusses Infocom's expansion beyond the Zork series, introducing new settings, genres, and experimental game mechanics. Some of their notable titles included the interactive mystery "Deadline", the science fiction adventure "Starcross", and the humorous "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" based on the popular series by Douglas Adams. The article also highlights some of Infocom's more innovative and experimental titles, like "A Mind Forever Voyaging" and "Trinity", which tackled serious themes and explored unconventional gameplay mechanics.</p>

<p>However, the article also explores Infocom's struggles. The market for text adventures began to decline as graphics-based games became more popular. Infocom attempted to diversify into business software with a database program called Cornerstone, but it was a commercial failure, and they were late to the graphical adventure game market, releasing titles such as "Leather Goddesses of Phobos 2" too late to save the company.</p>

<p>The article recounts how Infocom was acquired by Activision in 1986. While Activision initially allowed Infocom to operate relatively independently, creative tensions and financial pressures eventually led to the closure of Infocom's development studios in 1989. Activision continued to release Infocom compilations and re-releases for some time, but the original Infocom spirit was lost.</p>

<p>The article also touches upon the legacy of Infocom. Despite its relatively short lifespan, Infocom had a profound impact on the gaming industry and on interactive fiction. Their games are fondly remembered for their immersive storytelling, challenging puzzles, and sophisticated writing. The Z-machine lived on through enthusiasts, and the games are still playable today via interpreters on modern computers. The article mentions the rise of the Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation (IFTF) and the continued interest in interactive fiction.</p>

<p>The article concludes by emphasizing the enduring appeal of Infocom's games and the company's contribution to the art of interactive storytelling. It portrays Infocom as a unique company with a strong sense of identity and a lasting influence on the world of games and literature.</p>
