    <div>
<div>
  <p>The article is a comprehensive open-source computer science curriculum. It's designed as a complete path for students to get a computer science education using online materials that are available for free. The curriculum is suitable for self-learners, or those who want to supplement their formal education. The curriculum covers a broad range of topics in computer science, including introductory programming, core programming concepts, math for computer science, computer architecture, operating systems, algorithms, databases, networking, security, software engineering, artificial intelligence, and more. The curriculum prioritizes building a solid foundation in theoretical concepts before moving to more advanced or specialized topics. It emphasizes learning by doing, with the expectation that students will actively engage with the material through coding projects and exercises. The courses are primarily based on free online courses from platforms like MIT OpenCourseWare, edX, Coursera, and Udacity, supplemented with textbooks and other resources. The curriculum is structured into different categories, starting with Introduction to Computer Science, Core Programming, Math for Computer Science, Computer Systems, Theory, Applications, and Advanced Programming. Each category lists specific courses and textbooks with estimated hours to complete each course. The curriculum is constantly updated and maintained by a community of contributors.</p>
