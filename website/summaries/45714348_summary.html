<p>The article discusses how smartphones are designed to be emotionally manipulative and trigger reflexive behaviors, contributing to addiction. It explains that smartphones are engineered to exploit our emotions and reflexes through variable rewards, social validation, and the fear of missing out (FOMO). Notifications, in particular, trigger a dopamine response, reinforcing the habit of constantly checking our phones. Social media apps provide variable rewards in the form of likes, comments, and shares, creating a feedback loop that keeps users engaged. The article also mentions how the design of apps and the use of persuasive technology can influence our behavior without our conscious awareness.</p>
