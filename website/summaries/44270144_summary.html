<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The article discusses an experiment conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, where strangers were given the opportunity to anonymously send money to other strangers. The study explored the motivations behind such acts of generosity and the psychological factors influencing decisions about charitable giving when there are no direct benefits or social expectations involved.
</p>
<p>
In the experiment, participants were paired anonymously and given a small sum of money. One person in each pair was given the option to send some, all, or none of their money to the other person. The recipient had no prior knowledge of the sender's decision and no opportunity to reciprocate or interact with the sender in the future. This setup was designed to isolate pure altruism, where the giver receives no tangible reward or recognition for their actions.
</p>
<p>
The researchers found that a significant portion of participants chose to give some of their money to the anonymous recipient, even though there was no rational, self-interested reason to do so. This suggests that people are intrinsically motivated to help others, even in the absence of any personal gain. The study also explored factors that might influence the amount of money given, such as the perceived need of the recipient or the giver's own level of wealth.

<p>
The findings of this experiment have implications for understanding charitable giving and prosocial behavior. They suggest that altruism is a fundamental human trait and that people are willing to help others even when there is no direct benefit to themselves. This has implications for designing effective charitable appeals and promoting prosocial behavior in society.
