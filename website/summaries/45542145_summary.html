    <strong>Summary:</strong>
    The article discusses the implementation of the EU's new rules on political advertising, which aim to bring more transparency to online political ads and combat disinformation. Major tech companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft are now required to label political ads, disclose who paid for them, and provide information on targeting criteria. These rules apply in the 27 EU member states and are designed to make political campaigning more open and accountable. The new regulations are part of the EU's broader effort to regulate online content and protect democratic processes from manipulation. While some welcome the move as a step towards safeguarding elections, others express concerns about the practical challenges of enforcement and the potential for unintended consequences. The tech platforms have been preparing for these changes, updating their advertising policies and creating transparency databases to comply with the new requirements. However, questions remain about how effectively these measures will be enforced and whether they will truly deter bad actors from using online advertising to spread disinformation or interfere in elections.
