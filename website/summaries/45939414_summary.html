<p>The website LLM Death Count tracks reported instances of large language models (LLMs) exhibiting harmful behaviors or failures, categorized as "deaths." These "deaths" encompass a wide range of issues, including hallucination, logical errors, security vulnerabilities, biased outputs, and susceptibility to adversarial attacks. The site emphasizes that the listed events are not literal deaths, but rather represent significant flaws or breakdowns in LLM functionality that can have real-world consequences.</p>

<p>The "deaths" are categorized into several types:  Hallucination refers to instances where LLMs generate false or nonsensical information. Logical Errors involve incorrect reasoning or problem-solving. Security Issues cover vulnerabilities that can be exploited to compromise the LLM or the systems it interacts with.  Bias reflects the LLM producing outputs that are discriminatory or unfair towards certain groups.  Adversarial Attacks describe situations where malicious inputs are used to manipulate the LLM's behavior or extract sensitive information. The website also features categories for unexpected behavior, coding errors and "prompt injection."</p>

<p>Each entry on the website includes a description of the incident, the date it occurred, the LLM involved, the type of failure, and a link to the source of the information.  The site aims to provide a centralized repository of LLM failures, facilitating awareness and promoting responsible development practices. By documenting these issues, the website hopes to contribute to a better understanding of the limitations and risks associated with LLMs.</p>

<p>The site makes it clear that it doesn't intend to instill fear, but to promote responsible AI development. It is a reference to point out that LLMs are not perfect and still have plenty of problems.</p>
