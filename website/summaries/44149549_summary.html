  <p>The article is a personal account detailing the author's experience interviewing for a position at Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu. The author applied for a remote role as a Senior Software Engineer. The interview process consisted of several stages, starting with an initial screening call with a recruiter, followed by a technical interview focusing on general programming knowledge, data structures, and algorithms. Next was a system design interview, and finally, a behavioral interview.</p>

  <p>The author describes the initial screening call as standard, covering their background, experience, and interest in the role. The technical interview, however, was perceived as less structured and more conversational than expected. The interviewer asked questions about the author's familiarity with different data structures, algorithms, and their practical applications. The author felt that the interviewer was primarily interested in understanding their problem-solving approach rather than simply testing rote memorization.</p>

  <p>The system design interview involved designing a URL shortening service. The author walked the interviewer through their proposed architecture, discussing various trade-offs related to scalability, data storage, and consistency. The interviewer probed the author's understanding of different technologies and design patterns relevant to building distributed systems. The author felt this round was challenging but also engaging and appreciated the opportunity to discuss their design choices in detail.</p>

  <p>The behavioral interview focused on the author's past experiences, how they handled challenging situations, and their approach to teamwork and collaboration. The interviewer asked questions about the author's strengths and weaknesses, their preferred working style, and their motivations for wanting to work at Canonical. The author prepared for this round by reflecting on their past projects and experiences, and by formulating clear and concise answers to common behavioral questions.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, the author was not offered the position. While they were disappointed, they found the interview process to be a valuable learning experience. They appreciated the professionalism of the Canonical team and the opportunity to engage in thoughtful discussions about software engineering. The author highlights that Canonical's interview process seemed to prioritize practical problem-solving skills, system design knowledge, and behavioral fit over purely theoretical knowledge.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, the article provides insights into Canonical's interview process for a Senior Software Engineer role, emphasizing the importance of technical skills, system design abilities, and behavioral attributes.</p>
