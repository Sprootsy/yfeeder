<p>The article reports on a study suggesting that subtle differences in gait, or the way a person walks, could potentially be an early indicator of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Researchers used machine learning to analyze the walking patterns of children and found that those with ASD exhibited distinct gait characteristics compared to neurotypical children. The study highlights the possibility of using gait analysis as a tool for earlier diagnosis and intervention for autism.</p>
