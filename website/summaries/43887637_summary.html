    This article provides a comprehensive overview of software samplers, instruments that digitally record and play back audio samples. It begins by explaining the core concept of sampling: recording a sound, storing it digitally, and then triggering it with a MIDI keyboard or other controller. The article discusses the evolution of samplers from early tape-based instruments like the Mellotron to modern digital samplers available as standalone hardware units or software plugins (VSTs, AUs, etc.).

    The article details the key components and functionalities found in most samplers. It covers sample playback modes, including one-shot (playing the sample from start to finish), looping (sustain), and various loop types (forward, backward, ping-pong). It also explains the importance of pitch shifting and time stretching, techniques used to change the pitch and tempo of samples independently. ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) envelopes are discussed in the context of shaping the amplitude of the sample over time.

    The concept of multi-sampling is introduced, where multiple samples of the same instrument are recorded at different pitches or velocity layers to create a more realistic and expressive sound. Velocity layers allow the sampler to trigger different samples depending on how hard a key is pressed, while keymaps assign specific samples to different ranges of notes on the keyboard.
  </p>

    Modulation is a central topic, explaining how parameters within the sampler can be dynamically controlled to create movement and variation in the sound. Common modulation sources include LFOs (Low-Frequency Oscillators), envelopes, velocity, key tracking, and external MIDI controllers. Modulation destinations can include pitch, filter cutoff, volume, pan, and other parameters.

    The article then delves into filters, explaining how they shape the frequency content of the sample. Common filter types like low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and notch filters are described, along with their characteristics and uses. Filter resonance (emphasis of frequencies around the cutoff) is also explained.
  </p>
  <p>
    The use of effects within samplers is also covered. These effects, like reverb, delay, chorus, and distortion, can be used to further shape and enhance the sound of the samples.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article highlights some popular sampler plugins, including Native Instruments Kontakt, Steinberg HALion, MOTU MachFive, and Ableton Sampler/Simpler, noting their strengths and common features.

    Finally, it touches upon creative sampling techniques, such as chopping samples into smaller pieces and rearranging them, using samples as textures or sound effects, and layering multiple samples to create unique sounds. The document emphasizes the sampler's versatility as a sound design tool, capable of both realistic instrument reproduction and experimental sound manipulation.
