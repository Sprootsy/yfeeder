<p>According to a Business Insider article from September 2023, Amazon's return-to-office (RTO) mandate is reportedly costing the company top tech talent. The article suggests that some employees, particularly those with highly sought-after skills, are leaving Amazon due to the RTO policy, opting for companies with more flexible work arrangements. This exodus of talent is happening as Amazon is investing heavily in AI and needs skilled employees to develop and manage these technologies. The article cites the rise of AI recruiters as a potential factor exacerbating the issue, as these tools make it easier for employees to find new jobs that better suit their preferences, including remote or hybrid work options.</p>
