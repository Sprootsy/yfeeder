  <p>This document is a listing of top-level domains (TLDs) as maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). It provides an authoritative reference to all officially recognized TLDs, which are the highest level domain names in the Domain Name System (DNS) hierarchy of the internet. The list includes both generic TLDs (gTLDs) such as .com, .org, and .net, as well as country-code TLDs (ccTLDs) that correspond to specific countries or territories, such as .us for the United States or .uk for the United Kingdom. Each entry in the list typically consists of the TLD string itself. The purpose of this document is to serve as a definitive and up-to-date registry for internet addressing, ensuring that software and systems that manage domain names have a consistent and accurate view of the TLD landscape. This is crucial for the proper functioning of the internet's routing and addressing infrastructure.</p>
