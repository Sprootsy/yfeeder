 <h2>Summary</h2>
 <p>In a blog post titled "Where Will My Kids Go?", Jeffrey Bigham reflects on the uncertainties and challenges parents of children with disabilities face when planning for their children's futures. He focuses on the period after the children leave the K-12 education system, highlighting the lack of clear pathways and the significant drop-off in available services and support. Bigham describes the "services cliff," where the relatively guaranteed and structured support system of schools disappears, leaving families to navigate a complex and often inadequate landscape of adult services.</p>
 <p>He stresses the emotional weight of this transition, noting that parents must grapple with difficult questions about their children's independence, living arrangements, employment opportunities, and overall well-being. The author points out the disparities in support based on the type and severity of disability, with some individuals receiving more comprehensive assistance while others are left with very little. The blog post underscores the need for more robust and accessible adult services, as well as greater societal understanding and inclusion of individuals with disabilities.</p>
 <p>Bigham also touches upon the importance of early planning and advocacy. He encourages parents to start thinking about these issues well in advance of their children's graduation, emphasizing the need to build strong support networks, explore available resources, and advocate for their children's needs. The post serves as a call to action for policymakers, service providers, and the community at large to address the gaps in adult services and create a more supportive and inclusive environment for individuals with disabilities as they transition into adulthood. He hopes his kids will find meaningful work and fulfilling relationships.</p>
