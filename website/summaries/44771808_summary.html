    <h2>Lina Khan points to Figma IPO as vindication of M&amp;A scrutiny</h2>

<p>According to the article, Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), is pointing to Figma's successful IPO as evidence supporting the FTC's increased scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the tech industry. The article suggests that the FTC's more rigorous approach to evaluating proposed deals, which has faced criticism from some quarters, is justified by the positive outcome of Figma remaining independent and eventually going public.
</p>
<p>The core argument revolves around the idea that if Adobe's acquisition of Figma had proceeded as initially planned, Figma's potential for innovation and growth as an independent entity might have been stifled. Khan and the FTC likely believe that their intervention, or at least the broader environment of heightened regulatory scrutiny, contributed to Adobe eventually abandoning the deal. This, in turn, allowed Figma to pursue its own path, culminating in a successful IPO.
</p>
<p>The article doesn't explicitly state the specific reasons Adobe cited for calling off the acquisition, but it heavily implies that regulatory pressure played a significant role. By highlighting Figma's IPO, Khan is essentially saying that the FTC's efforts to prevent potentially anticompetitive mergers can lead to better outcomes for consumers and the market as a whole, even if those outcomes aren't immediately obvious.
</p>
<p>The piece also implicitly addresses the ongoing debate about the appropriate level of government oversight in the tech industry. Critics of Khan's FTC have argued that the agency's aggressive stance on M&A could stifle innovation and investment. However, the article positions Figma's IPO as a counter-argument, demonstrating that preventing a large company from acquiring a promising startup can unlock significant value and foster competition.
</p>
<p>In essence, the article uses Figma's IPO as a case study to support the argument that increased regulatory scrutiny of tech mergers is not necessarily detrimental to the industry and can, in some cases, lead to positive results.</p>
