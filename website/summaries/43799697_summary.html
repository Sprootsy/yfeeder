  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The article "RSS as a Skill" argues that Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is an underappreciated and valuable skill in the modern information landscape. It posits that while RSS has faded from mainstream awareness, its ability to efficiently aggregate and filter information from various sources makes it a powerful tool for staying informed and managing information overload. The author contends that relying solely on algorithms and social media feeds for news and updates can lead to filter bubbles and a lack of control over the information one consumes. In contrast, RSS empowers users to curate their own personalized news feeds, ensuring they receive information directly from the sources they trust, without algorithmic interference.</p>
  <p>The article discusses the benefits of using RSS readers to subscribe to specific websites, blogs, podcasts, and other online content. It highlights the ability to quickly scan headlines, read full articles within the reader, and organize content into categories. The author emphasizes that RSS provides a chronological view of updates, unlike social media feeds that are often manipulated by algorithms to prioritize engagement over relevance. Furthermore, the article suggests that understanding and utilizing RSS can improve one's ability to research, track industry trends, and monitor specific topics of interest. By taking control of their information flow, users can avoid distractions, reduce information anxiety, and stay focused on what truly matters to them.</p>
  <p>The article also touches on the decline of RSS's popularity and attributes it to the rise of social media platforms and the convenience of algorithmic feeds. However, it argues that this convenience comes at the cost of control and personalization. The author encourages readers to reconsider RSS as a valuable skill for navigating the digital world and regaining control over their information consumption. They suggest that learning how to use RSS readers and identifying relevant feeds can be a worthwhile investment of time and effort, leading to a more informed and focused approach to staying up-to-date.</p>
