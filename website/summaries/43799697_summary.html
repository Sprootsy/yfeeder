  <p>The article "RSS as a Skill" argues that understanding and utilizing RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a valuable skill, especially in an era dominated by algorithm-driven content feeds on social media platforms. It posits that while RSS might seem outdated, it offers a more direct and controllable way to consume information from sources one chooses. The author highlights that relying solely on social media algorithms can create filter bubbles and limit exposure to diverse perspectives.</p>

  <p>The article details how RSS works, explaining that it allows users to subscribe to updates from websites and blogs, receiving new content directly in a feed reader. This contrasts with social media, where algorithms curate content based on user activity, often prioritizing engagement and potentially reinforcing existing biases. The author emphasizes the benefits of RSS in maintaining a personalized and diverse information diet.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the article touches upon the concept of decentralization and owning one's online experience. It suggests that RSS promotes a more open and less controlled information ecosystem compared to the walled gardens of social media. By using RSS, individuals can actively choose their sources and manage their information flow, rather than passively accepting what algorithms serve them.</p>

  <p>The author also provides practical guidance on how to get started with RSS, including recommending RSS reader apps and explaining how to find RSS feeds on websites. It acknowledges that finding RSS feeds may sometimes require some digging, but the effort is worthwhile for the control and customization it offers. The article implicitly encourages readers to reclaim agency over their information consumption and diversify their sources of knowledge.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, the article advocates for the continued relevance of RSS as a tool for informed and independent information gathering. It positions RSS as a skill that empowers users to curate their own information environment, resist algorithmic bias, and promote a more diverse and personalized online experience.</p>
