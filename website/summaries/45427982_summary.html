<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The article announces Sora, a text-to-video model created by OpenAI. Sora can generate realistic and imaginative scenes from text instructions. It can create videos of up to a minute in length while maintaining visual quality and adherence to the user's prompt. The model demonstrates a deep understanding of language, enabling it to interpret prompts accurately and generate compelling characters, settings, and visual details.</p>

<p>Sora is capable of generating complex scenes with multiple characters, specific types of motion, and accurate details of the subject and background. The model understands not only what the user has asked for in the prompt but also how those things exist in the physical world. Sora can generate videos with dynamic camera movements and different styles. In addition, the model can create videos from still images, animating and extending them, and also fill in missing frames in existing videos.</p>

<p>The article also highlights some of Sora's limitations. It may struggle with accurately simulating the physics of complex scenes and may not always understand cause and effect. For example, a person might take a bite out of a cookie, but afterward, the cookie might not have a bite mark. The model can also confuse spatial details of the prompt, for example, confusing left and right.</p>

<p>OpenAI is taking several safety steps before making Sora available to the public. They are red-teaming the model to assess potential risks or harms. They are also developing tools to detect misleading content, including a detection classifier that can identify when a video was generated by Sora. OpenAI also draws on its previous work in areas like DALLÂ·E 3, which includes incorporating safety classifications to review text prompts. OpenAI is also working with policymakers, educators, and artists around the world to understand their concerns and identify positive use cases for the new technology.</p>

<p>The article emphasizes a cautious and iterative approach to releasing Sora, starting with a limited group of red teamers and visual artists. It underscores OpenAI's commitment to safety and responsible development as they continue to refine and improve the model.</p>
