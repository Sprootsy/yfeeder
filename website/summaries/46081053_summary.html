    <h2>28M Hacker News comments as vector embedding search dataset</h2>

  <p>The ClickHouse documentation provides a guide on how to use ClickHouse for vector search using the Hacker News dataset. The dataset consists of Hacker News stories and comments enriched with vector embeddings, which were generated using OpenAI's text embedding models. The guide outlines the steps to set up a ClickHouse instance, load the Hacker News dataset, create vector indices, and perform similarity searches. It also explains how to use different distance functions for vector comparison, such as cosine distance and Euclidean distance.</p>

  <p>The dataset is available in both Parquet and CSV formats, with approximately 60 million rows of Hacker News stories and comments. Each entry includes the text of the story or comment, metadata, and a 1536-dimensional vector embedding. The guide highlights how to use ClickHouse's vector functions and indexing capabilities to efficiently search for similar content based on the vector embeddings. This allows users to perform semantic searches, finding content that is conceptually similar even if it doesn't share the same keywords. It provides practical examples of creating tables, ingesting data, creating vector indices using the `hnsw` algorithm, and performing k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) searches using SQL queries. The guide also touches on optimizing query performance and provides links to additional resources for further exploration of vector search with ClickHouse.</p>
