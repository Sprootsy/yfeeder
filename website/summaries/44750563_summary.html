<p>This article from The New Yorker, titled "No Tax on Tips Is an Industry Plant," explores the history and implications of the widespread practice of not taxing tips in the United States. The article argues that the current system, which largely exempts tip income from taxation, is not a natural or inevitable state of affairs but rather the result of deliberate lobbying and political maneuvering by the restaurant industry. It traces the origins of the non-taxation of tips back to the post-Prohibition era, when restaurant owners sought ways to avoid taxes and reduce labor costs. The industry successfully argued that tips were gifts, not wages, and thus not subject to taxation.</p>

<p>The author contends that this system disproportionately benefits restaurant owners and higher-income servers while harming lower-wage workers and the government's ability to collect revenue for public services. The article highlights that the current system incentivizes underreporting of tip income, leading to significant tax revenue loss. It also points out that the lack of taxation on tips contributes to economic inequality, as it allows some service workers to earn substantial untaxed income while other low-wage workers have all of their earnings taxed.</p>

<p>The article further examines the complexities of tip income reporting and the challenges faced by the IRS in enforcing tax laws related to tips. It notes that many servers, especially those in high-end restaurants, are able to significantly underreport their tip income without facing serious consequences. The author also delves into the cultural and social norms surrounding tipping in the U.S., arguing that the system fosters a sense of entitlement among some servers and can lead to discrimination against customers who are perceived as poor tippers.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the article contrasts the U.S. system with those in other countries, where tipping is less common or where tips are treated as regular wages and subject to taxation. It suggests that the U.S. could learn from these examples and adopt a more equitable and efficient system for taxing service income. The author proposes several potential reforms, including eliminating tipping altogether and raising menu prices to compensate workers, or treating tips as wages and subjecting them to the same tax rules as other forms of income.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the article argues that the non-taxation of tips in the U.S. is a historical anomaly perpetuated by industry lobbying and that it has significant negative consequences for tax revenue, economic equality, and the fairness of the tax system. It calls for a reevaluation of the current system and consideration of alternative approaches that would ensure that all income, including tips, is taxed fairly and efficiently.</p>
