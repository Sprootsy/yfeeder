  <p>The article is a README file for ExTracker, a tool designed to track and visualize the execution of Elixir code. ExTracker allows developers to gain insights into the performance and behavior of their Elixir applications by tracing function calls and recording associated data. It works by instrumenting the code with tracing probes, which capture information such as function names, arguments, return values, and execution times. This data is then collected and presented in a user-friendly format, enabling developers to identify bottlenecks, understand call flows, and optimize their code.</p>

  <p>The tool supports various tracing options, including the ability to trace specific modules, functions, or even individual lines of code. It also provides filtering capabilities, allowing developers to focus on the most relevant data and exclude noise. The collected data can be visualized in different ways, such as call graphs, flame graphs, and tabular reports, providing a comprehensive view of the application's execution profile.</p>

  <p>ExTracker aims to be non-intrusive and easy to use, with a minimal impact on the performance of the traced application. It integrates seamlessly with the Elixir development environment and can be used in both development and production settings. The tool is particularly useful for debugging complex applications, optimizing performance-critical code, and understanding the behavior of third-party libraries.</p>

  <p>The README file provides detailed instructions on how to install, configure, and use ExTracker. It also includes examples of how to use the tool to trace different types of Elixir code and visualize the collected data. The documentation covers various aspects of ExTracker, such as the tracing API, the data collection process, and the available visualization options. It also discusses best practices for using ExTracker effectively and avoiding common pitfalls.</p>

  <p>In summary, ExTracker is a powerful tool for tracing and visualizing the execution of Elixir code, providing developers with valuable insights into the performance and behavior of their applications. It offers a flexible and non-intrusive way to instrument code, collect data, and visualize the results in a user-friendly format.</p>
