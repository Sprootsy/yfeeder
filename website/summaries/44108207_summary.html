<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>
The article from Indy Week focuses on the practice of dumpster diving among Duke University students. It highlights how students are retrieving discarded items, particularly furniture and household goods, from dumpsters near the end of the academic year when many students move out. This activity serves multiple purposes, including furnishing their own apartments, reselling items, and donating usable goods to charity. The article describes the types of items found, such as couches, chairs, lamps, clothing, and unopened food, and emphasizes the wastefulness of students discarding these items instead of donating or selling them. It delves into the motivations of the dumpster divers, who are driven by environmental concerns, financial savings, and a desire to reduce waste. The legality and safety of dumpster diving are briefly addressed. The piece also touches on the broader issue of waste on college campuses and the potential for more sustainable practices.
