  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>
    A bipartisan group of U.S. Senators, including Thom Tillis, Patrick Leahy, and Mazie Hirono, has introduced the "Stopping Online Piracy Act" (SOPA) styled "Protecting Lawful Streaming Act of 2023," often referred to as "BLOCKbeard." This bill aims to combat online piracy by granting the U.S. Attorney General the authority to seek court orders against websites primarily engaged in offering or facilitating access to copyrighted material illegally.
  </p>
  <p>
    The proposed legislation targets sites that are "primarily designed or operated for the purpose of offering access to infringing content" and those that derive profit from copyright infringement. It allows the Attorney General to obtain injunctions against these sites, compelling internet service providers (ISPs), search engines, domain name registrars, and other intermediaries to take actions to hinder access to the infringing sites. These actions may include blocking access, removing links, and suspending domain names.

    The bill includes provisions designed to protect legitimate websites and prevent unintended consequences. It specifies that actions taken under the bill should be technically feasible and reasonable, and it includes a process for website operators to challenge the Attorney General's actions in court. The bill also emphasizes that it should not be used to target sites that host user-generated content or that have legitimate purposes beyond copyright infringement.
  </p>
  <p>
    This bill is the latest in a series of attempts to address online piracy through legislative means. Previous efforts, such as the original SOPA, faced significant opposition due to concerns about censorship and the potential for overreach. The sponsors of the current bill argue that it is narrowly tailored to target egregious offenders while safeguarding legitimate online activity.
  </p>
  <p>
    The bill's introduction has sparked debate, with copyright holders and entertainment industry groups generally supporting the measure, while digital rights advocates and some technology companies express concerns about its potential impact on free speech and innovation. The legislative process will involve committee hearings, debates, and potential amendments before the bill can be passed into law.
