    This article from Useful Fictions, titled "How to Increase Your Surface Area," discusses the concept of increasing one's "surface area" as a metaphor for expanding one's exposure to new information, experiences, and connections. The author argues that in today's rapidly changing world, where knowledge and opportunities are abundant, a larger surface area is crucial for serendipitous discovery and growth. The core idea revolves around actively seeking out novelty and diversity in various aspects of life, rather than passively sticking to familiar routines and echo chambers.

    The author elaborates on practical strategies for expanding surface area. These include diversifying one's information consumption by following people with differing opinions and exploring a wide range of topics. The article promotes the idea of venturing outside one's comfort zone and embracing new experiences, whether through travel, learning a new skill, or engaging with different communities. Building a diverse network of contacts is emphasized, as each connection represents a potential source of new ideas and opportunities. The author encourages readers to actively cultivate weak ties and engage in conversations with people from different backgrounds.

    The article suggests focusing on exploration rather than optimization, at least initially. The goal isn't to become an expert in everything, but rather to gain a broad understanding of different domains and identify areas of interest that resonate personally. This approach is contrasted with the tendency to narrowly specialize in a particular field, which may limit exposure to potentially valuable information and opportunities. The author acknowledges that increasing surface area requires effort and can sometimes feel overwhelming, but the potential rewards in terms of personal and professional growth are significant. By actively seeking out novelty and embracing the unknown, individuals can position themselves to discover new possibilities and adapt to a rapidly evolving world.

    The article is not just about passively absorbing information, but also about actively creating and sharing one's own ideas. The author suggests that by putting one's thoughts out into the world, individuals can attract feedback and connect with others who share similar interests. This process of creation and sharing further expands one's surface area and increases the likelihood of serendipitous encounters. Overall, the article provides a compelling argument for the importance of cultivating a large and diverse surface area in order to thrive in the modern world.
