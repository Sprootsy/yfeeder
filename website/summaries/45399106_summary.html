<h2>Summary</h2>
The article discusses Handy.Computer, a project aiming to create a personal computer focused on simplicity, user-friendliness, and privacy. It critiques the current state of personal computing, dominated by complex operating systems and applications often filled with unnecessary features and data collection practices. Handy.Computer seeks to provide an alternative by building a complete computing environment from the ground up, encompassing the operating system, applications, and even the hardware. The goal is to offer a seamless and intuitive experience, prioritizing user control and data security.

The article highlights several key aspects of Handy.Computer's approach. Firstly, it emphasizes building everything in-house, rather than relying on existing software or libraries. This allows for complete control over the codebase and ensures that all components are designed to work together harmoniously. Secondly, it focuses on creating a simple and understandable system. The aim is to reduce complexity, making it easier for users to understand how their computer works and what it is doing. This also improves maintainability and reduces the risk of bugs and security vulnerabilities. Thirdly, privacy is a central concern. Handy.Computer aims to minimize data collection and provide users with greater control over their personal information. This includes using end-to-end encryption and avoiding reliance on cloud-based services.

The article also mentions the challenges involved in creating a complete computing environment from scratch, including the significant time and effort required. However, the author believes that the potential benefits of a simpler, more private, and user-friendly computer are worth the investment.

The project is still in its early stages, and the article serves as an introduction to the project's goals and principles. It outlines the author's vision for a future where personal computing is more accessible, empowering, and respectful of user privacy.
