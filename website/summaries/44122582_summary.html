    <h2>Run a C# file directly using dotnet run app.cs</h2>

  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>The .NET team at Microsoft announced a new feature called "dotnet run-app," designed to simplify the execution of .NET console applications. This enhancement streamlines the development workflow by allowing developers to run applications directly from the source code directory without needing to navigate to the output directory or specify the project file explicitly. The command automatically finds and executes the application, significantly reducing friction, especially for simpler projects or when developers frequently switch between projects.</p>

  <p>The announcement highlights the challenges developers face when running .NET applications, particularly the need to build the project first and then navigate to the output directory (e.g., bin/Debug/net8.0) to execute the compiled application. This process can be cumbersome and time-consuming, especially when dealing with small, single-file console applications often used for testing or learning purposes.</p>

  <p>The "dotnet run-app" command addresses these issues by providing a more intuitive and direct way to run .NET console applications. It works by searching the current directory and its parent directories for a .NET project file (e.g., .csproj). Once found, it builds the project (if necessary) and then executes the resulting application. This eliminates the need for developers to manually locate the executable file or specify the project file path.</p>

  <p>The blog post emphasizes the benefits of this feature, including improved developer productivity, reduced cognitive load, and a more streamlined development experience. It is particularly useful for developers who work with multiple projects or frequently create and run small console applications. The command is designed to be simple to use and requires no additional configuration.</p>

  <p>The "dotnet run-app" command is enabled by default in .NET 8 SDK. The blog post encourages developers to try out the feature and provide feedback to the .NET team. It also includes examples of how to use the command and explains the underlying logic behind its implementation. Furthermore, it acknowledges the contributions of the community members who suggested and helped refine the feature.</p>
