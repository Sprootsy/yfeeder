  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article is a comprehensive log of release notes for models developed by OpenAI. It covers various models, including GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and other related models, detailing updates, improvements, and changes implemented over time. These notes provide information regarding model capabilities, pricing, context window sizes, function calling, tool use, rate limits, and specific adjustments made to improve performance and address issues. The release notes also cover changes to moderation models, DALL-E models, and embedding models, focusing on enhancements in safety, image quality, and cost efficiency.
  </p>
  <p>
    The updates span from initial releases to fine-tuning and iterations, each aimed at refining the models for better accuracy, efficiency, and safety. Specific improvements include increased context window sizes in certain models, enabling them to process more information in a single request, enhanced function calling capabilities for better interaction with external tools and APIs, and refined content filtering to improve safety. Pricing adjustments are also detailed, along with changes to rate limits to manage resource usage.
  </p>
  <p>
    The release notes also address specific issues or bugs that were identified and fixed, such as problems with non-English function calling, JSON mode, and various edge-case scenarios. Furthermore, the documentation outlines plans for future updates, deprecation timelines for older models, and migration strategies for users to transition to newer, more capable versions. The overall objective is to keep users informed about the evolution of OpenAI's models, enabling them to leverage the latest features and improvements in their applications while maintaining awareness of changes that might affect their implementations.
