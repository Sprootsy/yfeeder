  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
   The article "Your Manager Is Not Your Best Friend" discusses the importance of maintaining a professional boundary with your manager. It emphasizes that while it's beneficial to have a good working relationship with your manager, it should not cross the line into a best-friend type of personal relationship.
  </p>
  <p>
   The author points out that managers have responsibilities that can create conflicts of interest if they become too personally involved with their direct reports. A manager needs to make objective decisions about performance evaluations, promotions, and even disciplinary actions. These decisions can be difficult to make fairly if a manager is too close to an employee on a personal level. Favoritism, or even the appearance of favoritism, can damage team morale and create legal issues for the company.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article also highlights the potential for discomfort and awkwardness if the relationship sours. If a close friendship between a manager and employee deteriorates, it can make the work environment unpleasant for both parties and potentially impact the employee's career. The manager may struggle to remain objective, and the employee may feel unfairly treated or targeted.
  </p>
  <p>
   Additionally, the author cautions that oversharing personal information with your manager can be risky. Information shared in confidence might be unintentionally revealed or could influence the manager's perception of your professional capabilities. It's crucial to remember that the manager's primary responsibility is to the company, not to be a confidant.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article suggests building a relationship with your manager based on mutual respect, open communication, and trust, while keeping it within professional boundaries. This involves being reliable, communicative, and respectful, and maintaining appropriate boundaries. It means focusing on work-related topics during work hours and avoiding sharing overly personal details.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ultimately, the article argues that maintaining a professional distance protects both the employee and the manager, ensuring fair treatment, avoiding potential conflicts of interest, and preserving a healthy work environment. The goal is to have a productive and respectful working relationship, not a deep personal friendship.
