    <h2>I am uninstalling AI coding assistants from my personal computer</h2>

  <p>The article is a personal reflection on the author's experience with using AI coding assistants, specifically GitHub Copilot, and their decision to uninstall it. The author initially embraced AI coding tools with enthusiasm, drawn by the promise of increased productivity and the allure of working alongside an "AI pair programmer." They recount a honeymoon period where Copilot seemed helpful, particularly in suggesting boilerplate code and automating repetitive tasks. However, this initial positive impression gradually waned as the author encountered several drawbacks.</p>
  <p>One major issue was the impact on the author's learning and problem-solving abilities. While Copilot could quickly generate code snippets, the author found themselves becoming overly reliant on its suggestions, leading to a decreased understanding of the underlying code and a diminished capacity to solve problems independently. The author realized they were accepting Copilot's solutions without fully comprehending them, which hindered their ability to debug effectively or adapt the code to specific needs. This reliance also stifled their curiosity and motivation to explore alternative solutions or delve deeper into unfamiliar areas of the codebase.</p>
  <p>Another concern was the quality of the generated code. The author observed that Copilot often produced code that was syntactically correct but semantically flawed, introducing subtle bugs or inefficiencies. While Copilot could generate code rapidly, the author found themselves spending more time reviewing and correcting its suggestions than they would have spent writing the code themselves from scratch. This negated the intended productivity gains and added an extra layer of cognitive load to the development process.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the author noted that Copilot's suggestions were heavily influenced by the existing codebase, which could perpetuate existing design flaws or coding style inconsistencies. Rather than promoting best practices or suggesting innovative solutions, Copilot tended to reinforce the status quo, hindering code improvement and innovation. The author also expressed concern about the potential for Copilot to introduce security vulnerabilities or licensing issues by suggesting code snippets from unknown or untrusted sources.</p>
  <p>The author also discusses the broader implications of AI coding assistants on the software development profession. They worry about the potential for these tools to deskill developers, reduce creativity, and homogenize codebases. The author also questions the ethical implications of using AI models trained on vast amounts of publicly available code, raising concerns about copyright infringement and the potential for bias in the generated code.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, the author decided to uninstall Copilot and return to a more traditional coding workflow. They acknowledge that AI coding assistants may be beneficial in certain contexts or for certain developers, but they believe that, for their own learning and development, it's essential to maintain a hands-on approach to coding and cultivate a deeper understanding of the underlying principles.</p>
