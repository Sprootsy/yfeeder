    <div>
<div>
  <p>This article introduces a microcode browser for the Intel 8086 microprocessor, offering a way to explore the inner workings of this foundational processor. The author reverse-engineered the 8086's microcode from die photographs and other available resources and created a tool that allows users to navigate and understand the micro-instructions that control the processor's operation. The browser provides a disassembled view of the microcode, showing the individual micro-operations that are executed for each instruction. It also includes annotations and explanations to help users understand the purpose of each micro-instruction. The author emphasizes the complexity of the 8086's microcode and the challenges in reverse-engineering it. They also highlight the insights gained from examining the microcode, such as understanding how specific instructions are implemented and how the processor handles different addressing modes. The article also delves into specific details about the microcode structure, including the use of ROM (Read-Only Memory) to store the micro-instructions, the organization of the microcode sequences, and the control signals that are generated by the microcode to control the processor's internal components. The tool allows users to trace the execution of instructions through the microcode, step-by-step, providing a detailed view of the processor's operation. The author notes that the 8086's microcode is more complex than that of some other processors of the time, reflecting the 8086's richer instruction set and more advanced features. The article provides a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding the inner workings of the 8086 processor and the principles of microcoded processor design.</p>
