<h3>Short Description</h3>
<p>Material Design has evolved to Material 3, which emphasizes personalization and expressiveness.

This customization extends across Android devices and now includes Wear OS. The update allows developers to leverage Material 3's components to create consistent and delightful experiences across different form factors, like phones and wearables. The Wear OS implementation focuses on glanceability, ease of use, and providing essential information quickly. By offering updated components and guidance, Google aims to empower developers to build more user-centric applications that feel native and intuitive, thus enhancing the overall user experience on both Android and Wear OS devices. This includes tools and resources to help developers migrate to Material 3 and take full advantage of its capabilities.</p>
