<p>NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft has detected a significant increase in plasma density at the edge of our solar system, near the heliopause. This boundary, where the solar wind meets interstellar space, features a "plasma wall" with temperatures ranging from 30,000 to 50,000 Kelvin. The discovery, made using Voyager 1's Plasma Wave Subsystem, reveals a far more dynamic and complex interaction between the solar system and interstellar medium than previously understood. The probe measured electron density, and the high-temperature plasma wall is likely due to the compression and heating of interstellar plasma as it encounters the heliopause. This region, known as the heliosheath, acts as a buffer zone. These findings contribute significantly to our understanding of the heliosphere's structure and how it shields us from harmful galactic cosmic rays. It indicates that the heliopause is not a smooth boundary but a complex and turbulent region. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are the only spacecraft to have directly explored this region, providing invaluable data.</p>
