        <h1>Fossil fuels fall below 50% of US electricity for the first month on record</h1>
        <p>Here&#39;s a summary of the Ember article:

**Summary:**

For the first time on record, fossil fuels generated less than 50% of U.S. electricity in April 2024. This milestone was reached due to a combination of factors including increased renewable energy generation, particularly solar and wind, lower electricity demand, and increased nuclear generation. The decrease in fossil fuel reliance was most pronounced in the power sector.

Renewables, including solar, wind, hydro, and biomass, generated 31% of the electricity, with solar generation seeing substantial growth (a 36% increase compared to April 2023). Nuclear power contributed 20% to the electricity mix, playing a significant role in displacing fossil fuels. Overall, clean energy sources accounted for over half (51%) of the electricity generation in April.

A mild winter and resulting lower heating demand contributed to a reduction in overall electricity demand. The decrease in electricity demand, combined with the growth of renewable energy sources, led to a significant drop in fossil fuel generation.

While April marks a turning point, Ember emphasizes that sustained policy support and investment are crucial to ensure the trend continues throughout the year and beyond. The report suggests that the growth of renewables needs to be accelerated, grid infrastructure needs to be improved to integrate the new renewable capacity, and supportive policies should be implemented to ensure a stable transition away from fossil fuels. Although it is expected that fossil fuels&#39; share will increase again during the summer, the overall trend toward clean energy is unmistakable.

**Key Points:**

*   Fossil fuels accounted for less than 50% of U.S. electricity generation in April 2024, a record low.
*   Renewables, including solar, wind, hydro, and biomass, generated 31% of electricity.
*   Solar generation increased significantly, growing 36% compared to April 2023.
*   Nuclear power contributed 20% to the electricity mix.
*   Clean energy sources (renewables and nuclear) accounted for over half (51%) of electricity generation in April.
*   Lower electricity demand due to a mild winter helped reduce fossil fuel generation.
*   Sustained policy support and investment are necessary to continue the trend away from fossil fuels.
*   Grid infrastructure improvements are needed to integrate new renewable capacity.
*   While fossil fuels&#39; share is expected to increase in the summer, the overall trend is towards clean energy.</p>
