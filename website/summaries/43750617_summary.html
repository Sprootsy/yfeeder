        <h1>Fossil fuels fall below 50% of US electricity for the first month on record</h1>
        <p>
 <div>
  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>For the first time on record, fossil fuels generated less than 50% of the United States' electricity in April 2024. This milestone was reached primarily due to increased renewable energy production and a slight decrease in electricity demand. Solar energy played a significant role in this shift, contributing substantially to the overall electricity mix. While this marks a turning point, the report indicates it's not necessarily indicative of a permanent trend, as fossil fuel reliance is expected to rise again later in the year.</p>

  <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
  <ul>
   <li>In April 2024, fossil fuels accounted for less than 50% of US electricity generation for the first time on record.</li>
   <li>The decrease in fossil fuel reliance was driven by increased renewable energy production, particularly solar, and slightly lower overall electricity demand.</li>
   <li>Solar energy was a key contributor to the rise in renewable energy generation.</li>
   <li>The report suggests that fossil fuel reliance is likely to increase again later in the year, implying that April's figures may not represent a sustained shift.</li>
