  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>The article details how Idealist.org, a non-profit connecting people with social impact opportunities, significantly reduced its infrastructure costs by migrating away from Heroku to a self-managed server. Idealist.org's initial setup on Heroku, while convenient for rapid development and deployment, became increasingly expensive as the platform scaled. Their monthly Heroku bill had ballooned to $3,000, prompting them to explore alternative solutions.</p>
  <p>The primary motivation for the switch was financial. Idealist.org, being a non-profit, aimed to minimize expenses while maintaining performance and reliability. They recognized that they could achieve substantial cost savings by managing their own infrastructure, even with the added operational overhead.</p>
  <p>The solution involved migrating their Ruby on Rails application to a single, well-configured server. The article highlights the specific technologies and configurations used, including Ubuntu as the operating system, Nginx as the web server, Passenger for application deployment, and PostgreSQL for the database. They also emphasized the importance of proper security measures, such as regularly updating the system and implementing a firewall.</p>
  <p>The author goes into detail about the server setup process, including installing the necessary software packages, configuring Nginx and Passenger to serve the Rails application, and optimizing PostgreSQL for performance. The article also mentions the challenges they faced during the migration, such as ensuring data integrity and minimizing downtime. They used tools like `rsync` for efficient file transfer and implemented strategies to keep the application running smoothly during the transition.</p>
  <p>The result of the migration was a dramatic reduction in infrastructure costs. Idealist.org successfully replaced their $3,000/month Heroku bill with a $55/month server. This represents a significant cost saving that allowed them to allocate resources to other important areas of their organization.</p>
  <p>The article also acknowledges that managing their own server requires more technical expertise and ongoing maintenance compared to using a platform-as-a-service like Heroku. However, for Idealist.org, the cost savings outweighed the added operational complexity. The migration allowed them to gain more control over their infrastructure and optimize it for their specific needs.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, the article presents a compelling case study of how a non-profit organization effectively reduced its infrastructure costs by migrating from Heroku to a self-managed server. It provides practical insights into the technologies and configurations used, as well as the challenges and benefits of such a transition.</p>
