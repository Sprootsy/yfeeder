  <p>The article discusses the fact that Hacker News, a popular social news website, is now running on Common Lisp. The author expresses their excitement and surprise, considering that Hacker News was originally written in Arc, a Lisp dialect created by Paul Graham. The article then delves into the historical context of Hacker News and its creator, Paul Graham, highlighting his contributions to Lisp programming and the influence of Lisp on his work, including Viaweb, the e-commerce platform he sold to Yahoo! that later became Yahoo! Store. The author discusses the choice of Arc as the language for Hacker News, explaining that Graham created Arc to have a more concise and powerful language for web development. However, Arc never gained widespread adoption, and its development has been somewhat stagnant. The author then elaborates on the reasons why Hacker News might have been migrated to Common Lisp. They speculate on the potential benefits of this migration, such as better performance, wider availability of libraries, and a larger community of experienced developers. They mention that Common Lisp is a mature and well-established language with a rich ecosystem, offering features like CLOS (Common Lisp Object System) and metaprogramming capabilities that could be valuable for maintaining and extending Hacker News. The author also acknowledges that the migration might have been driven by practical considerations, such as the difficulty of finding developers proficient in Arc or the need for better integration with existing infrastructure. Furthermore, the article also briefly talks about the advantages of using Lisp for web development, emphasizing its expressiveness and flexibility. The author also touches on the idea that choosing Common Lisp could signal a renewed interest in Lisp-based technologies within the Hacker News community and more broadly in the software development world. They suggest that the move to Common Lisp might attract new contributors and revitalize the project. The article ends by reiterating the importance of this change and how Hacker News running on Common Lisp can serve as a real-world case study.</p>
