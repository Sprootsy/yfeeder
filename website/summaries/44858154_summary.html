Derek Thompson's article "1910: The Year the Modern World Lost Its Mind" explores the idea that the year 1910 marked a turning point, or perhaps a point of no return, in the trajectory of the 20th century and beyond. It argues that before 1910, a certain optimism and faith in progress prevailed in the Western world. The article suggests that various intellectual, artistic, and political movements of the time reflected a growing sense of unease, anxiety, and a loss of faith in traditional values and institutions.

Thompson elaborates on the themes of societal change, cultural shifts, and intellectual ferment that characterized the era. He touches on the rise of modernism in art and literature, the challenges to established scientific paradigms, and the growing political tensions that would eventually erupt in World War I. The article posits that these developments collectively contributed to a sense of disorientation and a questioning of long-held beliefs about the nature of reality, human progress, and the future.

He delves into how new scientific discoveries, like those in quantum physics and relativity, challenged Newtonian physics, creating uncertainty about the fundamental laws of the universe. In psychology, Freud's theories about the unconscious mind disrupted traditional notions of rationality and human behavior. Artists and writers reflected this anxiety in their works, experimenting with new forms and themes that often expressed alienation, disillusionment, and a sense of the absurd.

Politically, the early 20th century was a time of rising nationalism, imperialism, and social unrest. The article suggests that these factors, combined with a growing sense of cultural and intellectual crisis, created a volatile mix that made the world ripe for conflict. It argues that the outbreak of World War I was not simply a political or military event, but also a symptom of a deeper crisis of meaning and values.

The author discusses the shift from Victorian values to more modern, and often unsettling, perspectives. The article doesn't explicitly claim that 1910 was the single turning point. Instead, it uses the year as a focal point to examine the complex interplay of factors that contributed to a profound sense of change and uncertainty in the Western world. In this sense, it serves as a meditation on the loss of innocence, the erosion of traditional certainties, and the emergence of a more complex and ambiguous modern world.
