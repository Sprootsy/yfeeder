<h2>Summary</h2>
The article is a GitHub repository for MunalOS, an educational operating system designed to teach OS concepts. It is written in C and Assembly, supports x86-64 architecture, and aims to be POSIX-compliant. The OS includes features like preemptive multitasking, virtual memory management, a VFS (Virtual File System), and support for various file systems (FAT32, Ext2). It also has a basic terminal and some system utilities. The project is intended for learning and experimentation, and contributions are welcome. The repository contains source code, documentation, and build scripts for setting up and running MunalOS in a virtualized environment like QEMU.
