    <h2>Making 2.5 Flash and 2.5 Pro GA, and introducing Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p>Google has announced the expansion of the Gemini 1.5 model family with the general availability of Gemini 1.5 Pro and the introduction of Gemini 1.5 Flash, a faster and more cost-effective model. Gemini 1.5 Pro, now accessible through Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, boasts a native 128K context window, enabling it to process vast amounts of information, including lengthy documents, codebases, and videos. For select developers and enterprise customers, the model supports a context window of up to 1 million tokens. Gemini 1.5 Pro excels in complex tasks such as reasoning, coding, and creative collaboration, demonstrated by its top performance in various benchmarks, including those for long-context understanding.</p>
<p>Gemini 1.5 Flash is designed for high-frequency, low-latency tasks where speed and cost efficiency are crucial. While being lighter than Gemini 1.5 Pro, it still provides impressive multimodal reasoning and is optimized for summarization, chat applications, image captioning, and data extraction. It also supports a context window of up to 1 million tokens, allowing it to leverage extensive information for its tasks. Gemini 1.5 Flash has been tested rigorously for safety and is designed to address potential risks associated with high-volume usage.</p>
<p>Both models benefit from improvements in Google's infrastructure and optimizations in model architecture, leading to enhanced performance and efficiency. Google emphasizes responsible AI development and deployment, incorporating safety measures and iterative refinements based on user feedback. The availability of Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash signifies Google's commitment to providing developers and businesses with versatile AI tools that can handle a wide range of applications, from complex analysis to rapid response interactions.</p>
