  <p>This article examines the influence of social network structure on the adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, focusing on how different network positions impact individuals' decisions to use these technologies. The research uses a large-scale behavioral dataset from a professional networking platform, encompassing information on individuals' connections, GenAI usage, and various professional attributes. The study leverages a quasi-experimental design, specifically an instrumental variable approach, to address potential confounding factors and establish causal relationships between network centrality measures and GenAI adoption.</p>
  <p>The core argument is that an individual's position within their social network significantly affects their likelihood of adopting GenAI. The authors investigate several measures of network centrality, including degree centrality (number of connections), eigenvector centrality (influence within the network), and betweenness centrality (acting as a bridge between different network clusters). They hypothesize that individuals with higher centrality scores are more likely to adopt GenAI due to increased exposure to information, social influence, and access to diverse perspectives. The study posits that these network effects operate through two primary channels: information diffusion, where central individuals are exposed to and influenced by their connections who have already adopted GenAI, and social contagion, where adoption spreads through direct peer influence and observational learning.</p>
  <p>The findings reveal a strong positive correlation between network centrality and GenAI adoption. Individuals with higher degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, and betweenness centrality are significantly more likely to use GenAI tools. The instrumental variable analysis supports a causal interpretation of these relationships, indicating that network position directly influences adoption decisions. Furthermore, the study explores the moderating effects of various individual and network characteristics. For instance, the impact of network centrality on GenAI adoption is found to be stronger for individuals in industries with higher GenAI relevance and for those with more diverse skill sets. The research also examines how network density and clustering affect adoption rates, finding that denser, more clustered networks can either accelerate or hinder adoption depending on the specific context and the prevailing norms within the network.</p>
  <p>The research contributes to the understanding of technology adoption by highlighting the crucial role of social networks in shaping individual behavior. It goes beyond traditional adoption models that focus on individual characteristics and technological attributes, emphasizing the importance of social context and interpersonal influence. The findings have implications for organizations seeking to promote GenAI adoption among their employees, suggesting that strategies should leverage network effects by targeting influential individuals and fostering collaborative learning environments. The study also provides insights for policymakers and technology developers interested in understanding the diffusion of new technologies and mitigating potential biases in access and adoption.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that social network structure plays a significant role in the adoption of generative AI tools. Individuals who occupy central positions in their networks are more likely to adopt GenAI due to increased exposure to information, social influence, and access to diverse perspectives. The research highlights the importance of considering social context when studying technology adoption and offers practical implications for organizations and policymakers.</p>
