    <h2>Rectal oxygen delivery might soon be a real medical treatment</h2>

The article discusses the potential of using the rectum to deliver oxygen to the body in cases of respiratory failure, a technique known as "enteral ventilation" or, more colloquially, "butt breathing." It highlights research published in the journal <i>Med</i>, where scientists demonstrated the effectiveness of this method in pigs. The study built upon previous work from the 1950s, which showed that mammals could absorb oxygen through their anuses if the intestinal lining was thinned.

The recent study involved two approaches: one where the intestinal lining was abraded to enhance oxygen uptake and another where oxygen was delivered in a liquid form using perfluorocarbons. The researchers found that both methods significantly improved oxygenation in pigs experiencing respiratory failure. Pigs treated with either method showed improved oxygen levels in their blood and were able to survive longer than those in the control group that did not receive the treatment.

The abrasion method involved using a mild enema to gently scrape the intestinal lining, while the perfluorocarbon method utilized liquids with high oxygen-carrying capacity. Both techniques aimed to facilitate the direct absorption of oxygen into the bloodstream through the capillaries in the rectal wall.

While the study was performed on pigs, the implications for human medicine are significant. The researchers suggest that enteral ventilation could potentially be a life-saving intervention for patients suffering from severe respiratory distress, such as those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or during situations where mechanical ventilation is not available or sufficient.

However, the article also notes that further research is necessary to determine the safety and efficacy of this approach in humans. Clinical trials would be needed to optimize the methods and assess potential side effects. Despite the somewhat unconventional nature of the technique, the potential benefits of "butt breathing" in treating respiratory failure warrant further investigation.
