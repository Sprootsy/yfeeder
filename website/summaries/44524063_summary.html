  <p>This Belkin support article discusses how to troubleshoot a Belkin Wireless Charger that is not working. It covers several models, including those with model numbers starting with F7U050, F7U052, F7U080, F7U065, F7U081, F7U082, F7U083, F7U088, F7U090, F7U091, F7U097, F7U101, F7U102, F7U114, F7U115, F7U116, F7U117, F7U121, F7U123, F7U124, F7U125, F7U126, F7U127, F7U128, F7U130, F7U132, F7U134, F7U135, F7U137, F7U138, F7U142, F7U147, F7U148, WIZ001, WIZ002, WIZ004, WIZ007, WIZ010, WIZ012, WIZ015, WIZ016, WIZ017, WIZ018, WIZ019, WIZ020, WIZ021, WIZ022, and AUC002.</p>

  <p>The troubleshooting steps begin with ensuring that the wireless charger is properly connected to a power source and that the power source is functional. Users are advised to check the power adapter and cable for any damage and to try a different wall outlet to rule out power issues. It is crucial to use the power adapter that came with the Belkin wireless charger, as using a different adapter might not provide enough power.</p>

  <p>Next, the article addresses the placement of the mobile device on the charging pad. It emphasizes the importance of centering the device on the charging surface and removing any obstructions between the device and the charger. These obstructions can include phone cases, especially those that are thick, metallic, or contain credit cards or magnetic strips. The user should try charging the device without a case to see if that resolves the issue. The article mentions that some devices might take a few seconds to start charging once placed on the pad.</p>

  <p>The document then delves into potential compatibility issues. While most Qi-enabled devices are compatible, there might be instances where a device is not fully compatible or has specific charging requirements. Users are encouraged to consult their device's user manual or the manufacturer's website to confirm Qi compatibility and any specific charging instructions. Older devices or devices with modified software might experience charging problems.</p>

  <p>The article also touches upon thermal management. Overheating can prevent a wireless charger from functioning correctly. If the charger or device feels excessively hot, the user should disconnect the charger from the power source and allow it to cool down before attempting to use it again. Charging in a cool environment can also help prevent overheating.</p>

  <p>The troubleshooting steps also include performing a power cycle. To do this, the user unplugs the wireless charger from the power outlet, waits for 15 seconds, and then plugs it back in. This can sometimes reset the charger and resolve minor software glitches.</p>

  <p>Finally, the article advises users to check for any firmware updates for their Belkin wireless charger, if applicable, through the Belkin support website or app. Keeping the firmware up to date can improve performance and resolve compatibility issues. If none of the troubleshooting steps resolve the problem, the article suggests contacting Belkin support for further assistance.</p>
