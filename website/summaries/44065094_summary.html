   This article details a method for cheating at the board game Settlers of Catan by loading dice and then statistically proving the dice are loaded using p-values. The author, Adam Izbicki, explains how to modify dice to favor certain numbers and how to rigorously demonstrate the manipulation's effect through statistical analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
   The core idea is to create a loaded die that rolls a specific set of numbers more frequently than others. The author focused on favoring the numbers 5, 6, 8, and 9, as these numbers are statistically advantageous in Catan. He chose to do this by drilling into the die to create an imbalance.
  </p>
  <p>
   To make the dice, he drilled small holes into the faces opposite the numbers he wanted to favor. The holes were then filled with epoxy. This makes those faces lighter, so they are more likely to end up on top of the die when rolled.
  </p>
  <p>
   After creating the loaded die, the author conducted multiple trials of dice rolls to gather data. He rolled the modified die a significant number of times (over 2000 rolls) and recorded the frequency of each number. This data was then compared against the expected frequencies of a fair die, where each number (1-6) has an equal chance of being rolled (approximately 1/6).
  </p>
  <p>
   To demonstrate statistically that the die was indeed loaded, Izbicki used the Chi-squared test. The Chi-squared test is a statistical test that determines if there is a significant difference between observed frequencies and expected frequencies. In this case, the observed frequencies were the actual counts of each number rolled with the loaded die, and the expected frequencies were the counts that would be expected if the die were fair.
  </p>
  <p>
   The author explains the calculation of the Chi-squared statistic, which involves summing the squared differences between observed and expected values, each divided by the expected value. A large Chi-squared statistic suggests a significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once the Chi-squared statistic is calculated, it is used to determine the p-value. The p-value represents the probability of observing the obtained results (or more extreme results) if the null hypothesis is true. In this context, the null hypothesis is that the die is fair. A small p-value (typically less than 0.05) suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis, indicating that the die is likely loaded.
  </p>
  <p>
   The author calculated the p-value and demonstrated that it was very small, providing strong statistical evidence that the modified die was not fair. He also provides a detailed walkthrough of the statistical calculation, making it accessible even to those without extensive statistical knowledge. He used both manual calculation and Python code.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, the author acknowledges the ethical implications of cheating in games and presents the exercise primarily as a demonstration of statistical principles and experimental design. He emphasizes the importance of understanding how statistical tests can be used to validate claims and detect biases.
