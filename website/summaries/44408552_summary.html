<p>The article "The Death of the Middle-Class Musician" in The Walrus examines the challenges faced by musicians in Canada, particularly those aiming for a sustainable, middle-class existence through their art. It argues that significant shifts in the music industry, technological advancements, and economic realities have made it increasingly difficult for musicians to earn a living wage and maintain a stable career.</p>

<p>The author outlines how the traditional pathways to success, such as record deals, radio play, and touring, have been disrupted. The rise of streaming services has devalued music, generating meager royalties for most artists. While offering wider exposure, these platforms often fail to translate into substantial income. The decline in physical album sales and the closure of music venues further exacerbate the problem.</p>

<p>The gig economy, characterized by short-term contracts and freelance work, has become the norm for many musicians, leading to financial instability and a lack of benefits. Musicians often rely on multiple income streams, such as teaching, session work, or side jobs, to make ends meet. However, these additional commitments can detract from their artistic pursuits and lead to burnout.</p>

<p>The article also explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced the cancellation of live performances and further devastated the music industry. Government support programs provided temporary relief, but the long-term effects of the pandemic remain uncertain. Many musicians have been forced to re-evaluate their careers and consider alternative paths.</p>

<p>Despite the challenges, the author highlights the resilience and creativity of musicians, who continue to adapt and find new ways to connect with audiences. Some are turning to crowdfunding, online platforms, and direct-to-fan strategies to generate revenue. Others are focusing on niche markets and building strong local communities.</p>

<p>The article concludes by emphasizing the need for systemic changes to support musicians and ensure the sustainability of the music industry. This includes fair compensation for streaming, increased government funding for the arts, and policies that protect the rights of artists. Without such measures, the future of the middle-class musician remains uncertain.</p>
