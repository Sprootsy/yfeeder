    <h2>Hackers can steal 2FA codes and private messages from Android phones</h2>

    <b>Summary:</b>
    A new attack, named "Pileup," allows hackers to steal two-factor authentication (2FA) codes and other sensitive data from Android phones, even when the codes are delivered via SMS. The attack exploits how Android handles intents, which are inter-app messages that trigger specific actions. By crafting a malicious app that registers itself to handle certain intents, attackers can intercept 2FA codes and other information intended for legitimate apps. This interception is possible because Android's intent system sometimes delivers messages to multiple apps simultaneously, rather than exclusively to the intended recipient. The vulnerability affects a wide range of Android versions, including the latest ones, and is particularly concerning because it can bypass the security provided by 2FA, which is widely used to protect online accounts. The researchers who discovered the attack have not yet found a complete fix, and Google is reportedly working on addressing the issue. In the meantime, users are advised to be cautious about the apps they install and the permissions they grant, but these measures offer limited protection. The "Pileup" attack highlights a fundamental flaw in Android's inter-app communication mechanism and the challenges of securing mobile devices against sophisticated attacks.
