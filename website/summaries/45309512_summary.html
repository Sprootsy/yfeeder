  <p>Simon Sinek's article outlines the differences between managers and leaders, highlighting five common behaviors exhibited by managers that leaders would avoid. According to Sinek, the core distinction lies in motivation and perspective: managers focus on control and short-term results, driven by authority, while leaders inspire and empower, focusing on long-term vision and the growth of their people.</p>
  <p>The first key difference is how they see their team. Managers see their team as employees, while leaders see them as people. Managers are more concerned with the output, ensuring tasks are completed efficiently, often overlooking the individual needs and aspirations of their team members. Leaders, on the other hand, recognize that their team members are individuals with unique lives, goals, and challenges. They prioritize understanding and supporting their team on a personal level, fostering a culture of empathy and genuine connection.</p>
  <p>The second key difference is about the objective. Managers aim to achieve a target, while leaders aim to advance a cause. Managers are typically focused on meeting specific quotas, deadlines, or financial goals. Their primary concern is hitting the numbers, even if it means sacrificing long-term sustainability or the well-being of their team. Leaders, however, are driven by a larger purpose or cause. They inspire their team to work towards a shared vision that transcends short-term gains, fostering a sense of meaning and purpose in their work.</p>
  <p>The third point is about trust. Managers want control, while leaders want trust. Managers tend to micromanage and exert control over every aspect of their team's work, driven by a fear of failure or a lack of confidence in their team's abilities. This stifles creativity and initiative. Leaders, conversely, prioritize building trust within their team. They empower their team members to take ownership of their work, make decisions, and learn from their mistakes, fostering a culture of autonomy and accountability.</p>
  <p>The fourth contrast is how they deal with errors. Managers fix blame, while leaders take responsibility. When things go wrong, managers are quick to assign blame to individuals, creating a culture of fear and defensiveness. This discourages risk-taking and innovation. Leaders, on the other hand, take responsibility for failures, recognizing that mistakes are opportunities for learning and growth. They create a safe environment where team members feel comfortable admitting errors and working together to find solutions.</p>
  <p>Finally, the fifth distinction covers the growth of people. Managers give directions, while leaders give direction. Managers provide specific instructions and expect their team members to follow them precisely, limiting their ability to think critically or develop their skills. Leaders offer guidance and mentorship, helping their team members understand the bigger picture and develop their own problem-solving abilities. They invest in their team's growth, providing opportunities for learning and development, and empowering them to reach their full potential.</p>
  <p>In essence, the article advocates for a shift from a management-centric approach to a leadership-driven one, emphasizing the importance of empathy, trust, purpose, responsibility, and empowerment in creating a thriving and successful work environment.</p>
