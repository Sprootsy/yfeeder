<p>Chloe Lee, a student from Northwood High School in Irvine, California, has been named a finalist in the Regeneron Science Talent Search 2025. Her research project focused on developing a novel computational method to predict the efficacy of cancer drugs based on multi-omics data. Multi-omics data integrates different types of biological information, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, to provide a more comprehensive view of cancer biology. Chloe's work addresses the challenge of accurately predicting how cancer patients will respond to specific drugs, which is crucial for personalized medicine. Her method aims to improve the selection of effective treatments and avoid unnecessary exposure to ineffective or harmful drugs. The Regeneron Science Talent Search is a prestigious science and math competition for high school seniors, recognizing and empowering the next generation of scientific leaders.
