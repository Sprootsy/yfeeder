  <p>According to a report by Ember, solar energy led electricity generation in the EU during the summer of 2023, a historic first. Renewables accounted for 54% of the EU's electricity mix between May and August, driven primarily by solar and wind power. Solar generated 14% of the EU's electricity, surpassing gas (13%) for the first time. Wind power contributed 13%. While solar generation increased significantly (+13% year-on-year), hydro generation decreased due to droughts. Overall, the rise in renewables contributed to a decrease in fossil fuel generation, which fell by 17% compared to the same period last year. Coal generation halved, reaching a record low. The increased renewable output and decreased electricity demand resulted in a 23% drop in power sector emissions in the EU compared to the previous year.</p>
