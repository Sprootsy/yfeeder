  <p>According to documents obtained by the Guardian, during Donald Trumpâ€™s presidency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) significantly expanded its surveillance capabilities, partly through the use of tools acquired from an Israeli company called Cellebrite. Cellebrite is known for technology that can extract data from locked mobile phones. ICE's use of Cellebrite's technology reportedly went beyond typical criminal investigations and was deployed in immigration enforcement. The documents detail how ICE agents were trained to use this technology to access personal information, including communications, contacts, and location data, from individuals' phones, sometimes without warrants. This raises concerns about potential violations of privacy rights and due process. Furthermore, the Guardian's reporting suggests that ICE's collaboration with Cellebrite is part of a broader pattern of the agency adopting advanced surveillance tools, leading to increased scrutiny from civil rights organizations and privacy advocates who fear these technologies are being used to target and monitor immigrant communities disproportionately. The documents also reveal that ICE was exploring and using other surveillance technologies, expanding its ability to track and monitor individuals.</p>
