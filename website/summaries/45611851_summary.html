    A study led by researchers at UC San Diego suggests that low-level lead exposure may have affected brain and language development in Neanderthals and other extinct hominids. The researchers used the lead levels found in the teeth of Neanderthals and compared that with the levels known to cause subtle neurodevelopmental effects in modern humans. This research indicates that while the lead exposure levels observed in Neanderthals were lower than those that cause severe toxicity, they were within the range associated with subtle neurological and developmental effects in contemporary humans, potentially impacting cognitive functions crucial for language development and survival.

    The study involved analyzing the teeth of Neanderthals found in France, using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to measure lead levels. By comparing these lead levels with data on modern human lead exposure and neurodevelopmental effects, researchers estimated the potential impact on Neanderthal cognitive development. The article highlights that lead exposure, even at low levels, can disrupt brain development, particularly affecting areas related to language and complex cognitive functions.

    The researchers also took into consideration the sources of lead exposure for Neanderthals, hypothesizing that it could come from their environment, diet, or even the use of fire. The article emphasizes that while this study doesn't definitively prove that lead exposure hindered Neanderthal cognitive development, it suggests a plausible contributing factor to their eventual extinction. It broadens the discussion of factors potentially influencing Neanderthal cognition and evolution.
