  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The website "What Does One Billion Dollars Look Like?" provides a visual representation to help understand the magnitude of one billion dollars. It uses stacks of $100 bills to illustrate the physical space that such a large sum of money would occupy.
  </p>
  <p>
    The website starts by showing a single stack of $10,000, which is 100 $100 bills. It then scales this up to $1 million, represented by 100 of these stacks. This already occupies a significant amount of space, fitting on a standard pallet. Progressing to $100 million requires 100 pallets of $1 million each, demonstrating a substantial volume.

  <p>
    Finally, the website visualizes $1 billion as ten stacks of $100 million. This amount fills a large area, thus driving home how vast a sum of money one billion dollars truly is. The visual representation highlights the stark difference between amounts people may be familiar with (thousands or even millions) and the much larger scale of a billion. The website's images and calculations serve as a striking demonstration of the sheer volume and weight associated with such a large sum.
