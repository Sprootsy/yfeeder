    The article "First Attempt Will Be 95% Garbage" discusses the importance of embracing imperfection and iteration in the creative process, particularly in writing and software development. It argues that the initial draft of any creative work is likely to be flawed and that this is a natural and necessary part of the process. The author emphasizes that the key to improvement lies in recognizing this initial imperfection and using it as a foundation for revision and refinement.

    The article uses the analogy of sculpting to illustrate the creative process. The initial block of clay is rough and unformed, representing the first draft. It is only through repeated chipping away, shaping, and refining that the final sculpture emerges. Similarly, the first draft of a piece of writing or code is just the raw material that needs to be molded and polished.

    The author cautions against striving for perfection in the first attempt, as this can lead to procrastination and creative paralysis. Instead, they advocate for a mindset of "getting something down" and then iteratively improving upon it. This approach allows for experimentation, learning, and discovery, as the act of creating itself reveals new possibilities and directions.

    The article also touches on the psychological aspect of creativity. It suggests that the fear of failure and the pressure to create something perfect can be debilitating. By accepting that the first attempt will be imperfect, creators can free themselves from this pressure and approach their work with more openness and willingness to experiment.

    Furthermore, the piece stresses the value of feedback and collaboration. Sharing early drafts with others can provide valuable insights and perspectives that can help to improve the final product. Constructive criticism, while sometimes difficult to receive, is an essential part of the iterative process.

    In essence, the article promotes a growth mindset in creative endeavors. It encourages creators to view their work as a process of continuous improvement, rather than a quest for instant perfection. By embracing imperfection and iteration, creators can unlock their full potential and produce work that is both original and impactful. The author highlights that the initial draft is not a reflection of the creator's ability but rather a starting point for a journey of refinement.
