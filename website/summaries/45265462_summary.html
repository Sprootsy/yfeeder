<p>According to 404 Media, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has removed a study from a government website that indicated right-wing extremists were the most frequent perpetrators of domestic terrorism incidents in the United States between 1990 and 2021. The study, titled “Trends in US Domestic Terrorism: 1990-2021,” was authored by researchers at the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), which is the research arm of the DOJ. The study analyzed 27 years of data on terrorist attacks in the U.S. and found that right-wing perpetrators committed more attacks than any other group over the period examined.</p>

<p>The article notes that the study included several caveats, such as difficulties in classifying incidents and perpetrators due to overlapping motivations and ideologies, as well as challenges in distinguishing between hate crimes and acts of terrorism. It also acknowledges that the number of left-wing attacks increased in the 2010s but remained lower overall than right-wing attacks during the study period. Despite these caveats, the study's findings ran counter to claims that left-wing extremism poses a greater threat. The study also found a recent increase in attacks by individuals or small groups with no clear ideological motive.</p>

<p>The DOJ has not provided a specific explanation for the study’s removal, but a spokesperson told 404 Media that the department regularly reviews and updates its online content. The article notes the study’s removal comes amid growing political polarization and scrutiny of how the government addresses domestic extremism. It also comes as federal law enforcement has been criticized by Republicans for allegedly targeting right-wing individuals and groups. 404 Media was able to find a cached version of the study on the Internet Archive and made it accessible in their article. The removal of the study raises questions about the DOJ's transparency and potential influence from political considerations.</p>
