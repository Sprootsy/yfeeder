 <h2>Summary</h2>
 <p>
  According to an Associated Press article, the Supreme Court has ruled that the president has the authority to fire the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The FHFA oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are government-sponsored enterprises that back millions of mortgages in the United States. The case was brought by shareholders who argued that the structure of the FHFA, with a single director who could only be removed "for cause," was unconstitutional because it unduly insulated the agency from presidential control.
 </p>
 <p>
  The court found that the "for cause" removal restriction was unconstitutional, affirming that the president must have the power to remove the agency head to ensure accountability. The justices reasoned that limiting the president's power to remove the FHFA director infringed on the president's executive authority under Article II of the Constitution.

 <p>
  The ruling does not undo any actions taken by the FHFA during the period when its director was protected by the "for cause" provision. The court determined that invalidating past agency actions would create too much disruption and uncertainty in the housing market.
 </p>
 <p>
  The case has significant implications for the structure of other independent agencies that have similar "for cause" removal protections. The decision could lead to changes in the leadership and policies of these agencies, as it reinforces the president's authority over them.
