    <h2>In memory of the Christmas Island shrew</h2>

<p>
The article is an obituary for the Christmas Island shrew (<em>Crocidura trichura</em>), which is now presumed to be extinct. The Christmas Island shrew was a small, reddish-brown shrew endemic to Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean. It was first described in 1889 and was relatively common throughout the island.
</p>
<p>
The shrew's population began to decline in the early 20th century. By the 1980s, it had become rare, and the last confirmed sighting was in 1985. Despite numerous surveys and searches, no shrews have been found since then. In 2014, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) officially listed the Christmas Island shrew as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct). The formal extinction declaration has not been made, as there is some remote possibility of its persistence. However, the article treats its disappearance as a virtual extinction.
</p>
<p>
The reasons for the shrew's decline are not fully understood, but the introduction of invasive species is thought to be a major factor. The black rat (<em>Rattus rattus</em>) and the common wolf snake (<em>Lycodon capucinus</em>) are two introduced species that may have preyed on the shrews. Habitat loss due to mining and development may also have contributed to the decline. Additionally, introduced diseases could have played a role, even though there is no definitive proof.

<p>
The Christmas Island shrew is not the only mammal to have gone extinct on Christmas Island. The Christmas Island pipistrelle, Maclear's rat, and the bulldog rat have also disappeared in recent history, highlighting the vulnerability of the island's unique ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
The article underscores the need for stronger biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction of invasive species and for habitat protection to conserve the island's remaining biodiversity. The presumed extinction of the Christmas Island shrew serves as a cautionary tale about the impacts of human activities on fragile island ecosystems.
