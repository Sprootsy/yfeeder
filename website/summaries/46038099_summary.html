<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The article from XDA-Developers discusses the phenomenon of data loss on unpowered SSDs (Solid State Drives) over time. It highlights research conducted by computer scientists from the University of Toronto and Google, which investigated the data retention capabilities of various SSDs when left without power. The study revealed that SSDs, unlike traditional hard drives, are susceptible to data degradation even when not actively used, due to charge leakage from their NAND flash memory cells.</p>

<p>The researchers tested a range of SSDs, including both consumer-grade and enterprise-grade models, under different temperature conditions. Their findings indicated that higher temperatures accelerate the rate of data loss. The study also found that the age and usage history of the SSDs play a significant role, with older and more heavily used drives exhibiting a faster rate of data degradation. The key takeaway is that data stored on an unpowered SSD is not as persistent as commonly believed and can be lost over time, especially under unfavorable environmental conditions.</p>

<p>The article emphasizes the implications of this research for long-term data storage and archival practices. It suggests that users should be aware of the potential for data loss on unpowered SSDs and take appropriate measures to mitigate the risk. These measures include storing SSDs in cool environments, periodically powering them on to refresh the charge in the NAND flash memory, and backing up critical data to multiple storage mediums. The research serves as a reminder that SSDs are not a "set-and-forget" solution for data storage and require active management to ensure data integrity over the long term.</p>
