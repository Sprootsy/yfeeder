  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>
    Titania is a new systems programming language created by GingerBill. It aims to provide a modern and safe alternative to languages like C and C++, while also offering high performance and low-level control. The language is designed with a focus on simplicity, explicitness, and compile-time error detection. It incorporates features from various languages like Zig, Odin, Rust, and C++, aiming to blend their best aspects while avoiding common pitfalls.
  </p>
  <p>
    The language emphasizes manual memory management but provides tools and features to make it safer and easier to manage memory correctly. It utilizes concepts such as regions, arenas, and allocators to aid in memory management. Titania supports both value and pointer semantics, allowing developers to choose the most appropriate approach for a given situation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Titania's design favors explicitness over implicit behavior. This means that the language requires developers to be clear and specific in their code, which can help to prevent unexpected behavior and make code easier to understand. It also aims to provide good compile-time error messages to assist developers in identifying and resolving issues early in the development process.
  </p>
  <p>
    Titania has a built in build system. The documentation mentions that there is no package manager, due to the fact that the standard library should be enough.
  </p>
  <p>
    The language includes features like:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Custom allocators</li>
    <li>No hidden control flow</li>
    <li>No hidden memory allocations</li>
  </ul>
