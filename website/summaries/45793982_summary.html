While the idea of "attractive" body odor is subjective and complex, the article delves into research suggesting that diet plays a role in shaping our natural scent. The article highlights studies suggesting that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables may be associated with more pleasant and attractive body odor.

Conversely, the article notes that diets high in processed foods, red meat, and certain spices may contribute to less desirable body odor.</p>
