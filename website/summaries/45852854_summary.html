  <p>Valdi is a declarative schema validation library for Go. It focuses on simplicity and ease of use by allowing users to define validation rules using a declarative approach. This means that instead of writing complex, imperative code to check each field of a struct, you define the rules in a clear and concise manner, and Valdi handles the validation logic for you. The library supports a wide range of validation constraints, including checking for required fields, string length, numerical ranges, regular expression matching, and custom validation functions. Valdi is designed to be extensible, allowing users to define their own custom validators to handle specific validation needs. The library aims to provide a flexible and efficient way to ensure data integrity in Go applications, reducing boilerplate code and making validation logic more maintainable. It supports validating various data types, including primitive types, structs, slices, and maps. Valdi integrates well with common Go web frameworks and libraries, making it a versatile choice for building robust and reliable applications.</p>
