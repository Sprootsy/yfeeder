<h3>Summary</h3>
The article "Making a Website Part 1" by Ben Okopnik is a beginner-friendly guide to creating a simple website using HTML and CSS. It focuses on the practical aspects of building a basic website, explaining the fundamental concepts of HTML structure, tags, and attributes, as well as basic CSS styling. The article emphasizes a hands-on approach, encouraging readers to experiment and learn by doing.

The author starts by introducing the basic structure of an HTML document, explaining the purpose of the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. He demonstrates how to add a title to the page using the `<title>` tag within the `<head>` section and how to define the visible content of the page within the `<body>` section.

The article then delves into common HTML tags used for formatting text, such as headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), bold text (`<b>` or `<strong>`), and italicized text (`<i>` or `<em>`). Okopnik explains the difference between block-level elements (like headings and paragraphs) and inline elements (like bold and italics).

The use of lists (`<ul>` for unordered lists and `<ol>` for ordered lists) is also covered, along with how to create list items using the `<li>` tag. The author further explains how to create hyperlinks using the `<a>` (anchor) tag, including how to link to other pages on the same site or to external websites.

The article introduces the basics of CSS for styling the website. It explains how to use CSS to control the appearance of elements, such as changing the color of text or setting the background color of the page. The author primarily discusses inline CSS (using the `style` attribute directly within HTML tags) as a starting point, but also mentions the advantages of using external CSS files for better organization and maintainability.

Okopnik also touches upon the importance of choosing appropriate colors and fonts for readability and visual appeal. He provides a basic understanding of color codes and font selection. He uses specific examples to illustrate the concepts, and he encourages readers to view the HTML source code of other websites to learn from them. The article also includes practical advice on how to view the HTML source code of websites using web browsers.

The article does not cover advanced topics like JavaScript or server-side programming but provides a solid foundation for building simple, static websites. It's aimed at absolute beginners who have no prior experience with web development. Throughout the article, the author emphasizes the importance of validating the code and using proper HTML syntax to ensure that the website renders correctly across different browsers.

Overall, "Making a Website Part 1" serves as an accessible introduction to the world of web development, guiding readers through the initial steps of creating a functional and visually appealing website using basic HTML and CSS.
