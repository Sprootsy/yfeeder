<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The article by Ben Edelman discusses allegations of non-consensual app installations facilitated by AppLovin, a mobile app marketing and monetization company. The core of the issue revolves around the practice of bundling apps, where a user intending to install one app unknowingly installs additional apps without explicit consent.
</p>
<p>
The author presents evidence suggesting that AppLovin's SDK (Software Development Kit), which is integrated into numerous apps, has been used to install apps on users' devices without clear and informed consent. This is achieved by including offers for other apps during the installation process of the primary app. The user may be presented with checkboxes or options that are confusing or misleading, leading them to inadvertently agree to install additional apps. In some cases, the additional apps are installed automatically without any explicit user interaction.
</p>
<p>
The article highlights the potential deceptive nature of these practices. Users may not understand that they are agreeing to install multiple apps, or they may be tricked into doing so. This can result in a cluttered device, unwanted apps consuming resources, and potential security risks. Furthermore, it erodes user trust in the app ecosystem and the companies involved.
</p>
<p>
Edelman emphasizes that these non-consensual installations raise ethical and legal concerns. They may violate consumer protection laws and app store policies that require clear consent before installing apps. The author calls for greater transparency and accountability in the app installation process to ensure that users have control over what is installed on their devices.

<p>
The article presents specific examples and technical details to support the claims. It shows the flow of app installations and how AppLovin's SDK is involved in promoting and installing additional apps. The analysis of user interface elements and code snippets provides insights into the potential for misleading users and facilitating non-consensual installations.
</p>
<p>
The author also explores the broader implications of these practices for the mobile app industry. Non-consensual installations can distort app rankings and create an unfair competitive advantage for apps that employ these tactics. They also contribute to the problem of "crapware" or unwanted software on mobile devices.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, the article raises serious concerns about AppLovin's role in facilitating non-consensual app installations. It highlights the need for greater scrutiny of app marketing practices and stronger enforcement of user consent requirements to protect consumers and maintain the integrity of the app ecosystem.
