<p>The author begins by describing the memo's historical context. Jobs had just been forced out of Apple, the company he co-founded, after a power struggle with then-CEO John Sculley. The memo represents Jobs' attempt to chart a new course and define his goals for NeXT. The author notes that the memo reveals Jobs' ambition and his desire to prove his continued relevance in the technology industry.</p>

The memo outlines the target market, product strategy, and marketing approach for NeXT.</p>

<p>The author highlights Jobs' focus on software as a key differentiator for NeXT. While hardware was important, Jobs believed that software would be crucial in setting NeXT apart from its competitors. This emphasis on software foreshadowed Apple's later success with macOS and iOS. The memo also reveals Jobs' attention to detail and his insistence on quality in all aspects of the company's operations.</p>
