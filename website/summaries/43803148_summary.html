        <h1>Show HN: My self-written hobby OS is finally running on my vintage IBM ThinkPad</h1>
        <p>

  <p>RetrOS-32 is a 32-bit operating system designed for retro computers, primarily targeting systems built around the W65C02S processor. The project aims to provide a modern development environment and features for these older machines. It supports multitasking with preemptive scheduling, memory management including virtual memory, and a layered filesystem. The OS includes a suite of development tools such as an assembler, linker, and debugger, all designed to run directly on the target system. The goal is to create a platform that allows developers to write complex applications for retro hardware in a more efficient and modern way compared to traditional methods. RetrOS-32 intends to breathe new life into vintage computing by enabling a new generation of software and applications.</p>
