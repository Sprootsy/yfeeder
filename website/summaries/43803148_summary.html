  <h2>Summary of RetrOS-32</h2>
  <p>
    RetrOS-32 is a 32-bit retro-style operating system designed for learning and experimentation. It is intended to be simple and well-documented, making it easy for users to understand its inner workings and contribute to its development. The OS is written primarily in C, with some assembly language code for low-level tasks.
  </p>
  <p>
    The operating system features a monolithic kernel with preemptive multitasking, virtual memory management with demand paging, and a basic file system. It supports multiple processes and threads, allowing for concurrent execution of programs. The virtual memory system enables processes to access more memory than physically available, and demand paging loads pages into memory only when they are needed. The file system provides a hierarchical directory structure for organizing files.
  </p>
  <p>
    RetrOS-32 includes a command-line interface (CLI) shell that allows users to interact with the system. It provides basic commands for file management, process control, and system configuration. The OS also supports a simple text-based user interface (TUI) library for creating interactive applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project emphasizes portability and aims to run on various architectures, including x86 and ARM. It uses a build system based on Makefiles, making it easy to compile and run the OS on different platforms. The source code is well-commented and organized, making it easier to understand and modify.
  </p>
  <p>
    RetrOS-32 is designed to be a learning tool, and the project provides extensive documentation and tutorials to help users understand the OS concepts and how to develop applications for it. The project also encourages community contributions, and welcomes bug reports, feature requests, and code contributions.
