        <h1>Show HN: My self-written hobby OS is finally running on my vintage IBM ThinkPad</h1>
        <p>
<div>
<p>The article is a link to the GitHub repository for RetrOS-32, which is described as a minimal, hobby 32-bit operating system kernel written in C and Assembly. It's intended to run on the real hardware of 386 (and later) IBM PC compatibles. It specifically targets systems without an MMU (Memory Management Unit), which are generally older or embedded systems. The project's aim is to provide a foundation for experimenting with OS development on simpler hardware, avoiding the complexities of modern operating systems and MMU-dependent features.
