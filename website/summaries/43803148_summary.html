        <h1>Show HN: My self-written hobby OS is finally running on my vintage IBM ThinkPad</h1>
        <p>
<div>
  <h3>Summary:</h3>
  <p>
    The provided text is a README file for RetrOS-32, an open-source, 32-bit operating system designed for retro computers, specifically targeting machines with limited resources. It is built from scratch, not based on existing kernels like Linux or FreeBSD. RetrOS-32 emphasizes simplicity, efficiency, and customizability, aiming to provide a platform suitable for gaming, demoscene, and educational purposes. The OS is written primarily in C, with some assembly code for low-level operations. The README outlines the project's goals, features, system requirements, build process, and planned future development. It also includes information on contributing to the project and its licensing terms (GPL-3.0 License).
  </p>
  <p>
    RetrOS-32's goals include creating a fully functional OS that can run on relatively low-end hardware, offering a development environment for retro enthusiasts and hobbyists, and serving as an educational tool for understanding OS concepts. Key features mentioned include a preemptive multitasking kernel, virtual file system (VFS), memory management (including virtual memory and demand paging), device driver framework, and a command-line interface (CLI). It also has support for various file systems like FAT and ISO9660.
  </p>
  <p>
    The target hardware is a 386-compatible PC with at least 8MB of RAM, although it is designed to be scalable. The build process involves using the GCC cross-compiler toolchain for i586-elf. The README provides instructions for setting up the build environment and compiling the kernel, libraries, and utilities. It also mentions the use of tools like Make and possibly QEMU for testing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Future development plans involve improving the VFS, adding networking support (TCP/IP stack), implementing a graphical user interface (GUI), and expanding the range of supported hardware. The document encourages contributions from the community, welcoming bug reports, feature requests, and code contributions. The GPL-3.0 license allows for modification and redistribution of the OS, as long as the terms of the license are followed.
