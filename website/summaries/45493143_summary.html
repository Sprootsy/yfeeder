<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>The EarthSky article discusses the increasing rate at which SpaceX's Starlink satellites are deorbiting and falling back to Earth. It notes that, according to Harvard-Smithsonian astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell, between one and two Starlink satellites are now re-entering the atmosphere and burning up each day. This phenomenon is attributed to failures within the satellites themselves, rendering them unable to maintain their orbit. The article highlights that with over 6,000 Starlink satellites launched, and plans for many more, these failures and subsequent deorbiting events are becoming more frequent.</p>

<p>The article explains that the satellites are designed to burn up completely upon re-entry, thus minimizing any risk to people on the ground. The increasing rate of deorbiting satellites is primarily due to the sheer number of Starlink satellites in orbit. Any satellite can fail, and when failures happen, the satellites can no longer maintain their orbit and begin to fall back to Earth. The article also mentions that there are other companies planning to launch large constellations of satellites, potentially exacerbating the issue of satellite failures and deorbiting events in the future.</p>

<p>The article touches upon the fact that, while SpaceX designs its satellites to deorbit quickly and burn up in the atmosphere, the increasing volume of satellites launched raises concerns about space debris and the potential impact on astronomical observations. The deorbiting satellites add to the number of objects re-entering the atmosphere. While the risk to people is low, the frequency of these events highlights the need for continued monitoring and mitigation strategies to ensure space sustainability.</p>

<h3>Key Points:</h3>
