According to an analysis of insurance claims data, UnitedHealth Group's Optum employs or aligns with approximately 90,000 physicians in the United States. The analysis, conducted by researchers at the University of Chicago, found that Optum-affiliated physicians are paid about 17% more than other doctors in the same markets. This pay disparity amounts to an average of $67,000 more per physician annually.

<p>
The study examined payments made by commercial insurers, including UnitedHealthcare, to primary care physicians and specialists between 2016 and 2022. It controlled for factors such as physician specialty, patient demographics, and geographic location to isolate the impact of Optum affiliation on physician compensation.

The findings raise concerns about potential anti-competitive practices and the impact on healthcare costs. Critics argue that Optum's size and market dominance could allow it to negotiate higher reimbursement rates from insurers, which are then passed on to consumers through higher premiums. Some experts also worry that the higher pay could incentivize physicians to prioritize cost-cutting measures or limit patient access to care in order to meet financial targets.

UnitedHealth Group defended its compensation practices, arguing that Optum-affiliated physicians often take on more complex patients and participate in value-based care arrangements that reward quality and efficiency. The company also stated that the study's methodology may not fully account for differences in physician performance and patient outcomes.

The study's results have sparked debate among healthcare economists and policymakers. Some are calling for greater scrutiny of Optum's business practices and the potential impact on healthcare costs and quality. Others argue that further research is needed to fully understand the factors driving the pay disparity and whether it ultimately benefits or harms patients.
