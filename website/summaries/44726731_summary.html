  <p>The article is a blog post by Neil, detailing his experience of using XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) for all his communication needs for a month. He used Snikket, a user-friendly XMPP platform, to facilitate this experiment. The article covers his initial impressions, setup process, challenges faced, and overall reflections on using XMPP as a primary communication tool.</p>
  <p>Neil starts by explaining his motivation: a desire to move away from centralized, data-collecting messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal towards a more decentralized and privacy-respecting system. He chose XMPP due to its open standard nature, end-to-end encryption capabilities, and the availability of various clients and servers.</p>
  <p>Snikket was selected for its ease of use and focus on user experience, aiming to make XMPP accessible to non-technical users. Neil describes the straightforward setup process, which involved creating a Snikket account and inviting contacts. He highlights the benefits of Snikket's approach to contact management, where users invite contacts to a shared "family" server, simplifying the process of connecting and communicating.</p>
  <p>Throughout the month, Neil used XMPP/Snikket for text messaging, voice calls, and video calls. He discusses the challenges he encountered, including issues with media uploads/downloads, occasional call quality problems, and the lack of widespread adoption among his contacts. He also notes that some features, such as message reactions, were not yet available in the Snikket client he was using (Dino).</p>
  <p>Despite these challenges, Neil emphasizes the positive aspects of using XMPP. He appreciates the control over his data, the privacy benefits of end-to-end encryption, and the open and federated nature of the network. He also notes the positive response from some of his contacts who were willing to try XMPP.</p>
  <p>Neil concludes that while XMPP/Snikket is not a perfect replacement for mainstream messaging apps due to the smaller user base and occasional technical issues, it offers a viable alternative for those seeking greater privacy, control, and decentralization. He expresses optimism about the future of XMPP and Snikket, highlighting the ongoing development efforts and the potential for wider adoption as more people become aware of the benefits of open and decentralized communication protocols. He plans to continue using XMPP for certain conversations and hopes to see further improvements in the platform's usability and features.</p>
