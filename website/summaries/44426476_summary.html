<h2>Summary of Beanbook.app</h2>

<p>Beanbook.app is a personal finance application designed to help users track their net worth and investments, particularly focusing on those involved in cryptocurrency, stocks, and other asset classes. It aims to provide a clear, consolidated view of a user's financial standing, offering features tailored to both novice and experienced investors. The platform allows users to connect various financial accounts, including cryptocurrency exchanges, brokerage accounts, and bank accounts, to automatically import transaction data and asset valuations. This aggregation of information into a single dashboard simplifies the process of monitoring investment performance and overall financial health.</p>

<p>The application differentiates itself through its emphasis on privacy and data ownership. Unlike many mainstream financial tracking tools that store user data on centralized servers, Beanbook.app offers a self-hosted option. This means users can run the application on their own servers or devices, giving them complete control over their financial data. This approach is particularly appealing to users who are concerned about data security and privacy breaches. Even when using the cloud-hosted version, Beanbook.app emphasizes its commitment to data protection.</p>

<p>Key features include the ability to track a wide range of asset types, automated data import from various financial institutions, customizable dashboards and reporting, and tools for analyzing investment performance over time. The application also supports multiple currencies, making it suitable for users with international investments. Furthermore, Beanbook.app is designed to be extensible, allowing users with technical skills to customize the application and add new features or integrations. This extensibility is facilitated by the application's open-source nature and well-documented API.</p>

<p>Beanbook.app targets individuals who are actively managing their investments and want a more detailed and privacy-focused approach to tracking their net worth. It caters to users who may find traditional budgeting apps too simplistic or who are uncomfortable with sharing their financial data with large corporations. The self-hosting option, in particular, is a significant draw for technically proficient users who prioritize data sovereignty. The platform's support for cryptocurrency tracking is another key differentiator, appealing to the growing number of investors in digital assets.</p>

<p>In summary, Beanbook.app offers a comprehensive solution for tracking net worth and investments with a strong emphasis on privacy and data ownership, primarily targeting users involved in cryptocurrency, stocks, and other diverse asset classes. Its self-hosting option and commitment to data protection make it a compelling alternative to mainstream financial tracking tools.</p>
