<h2>Summary</h2>
The article discusses Amazon Web Services' (AWS) plans to launch an AWS European Sovereign Cloud, a separate and independent cloud for Europe. This cloud will cater to customers in highly regulated industries and the public sector, allowing them to store data and run applications while meeting stringent data residency, security, and compliance requirements. Key aspects of this initiative include data being stored and processed solely within the EU, with access restricted to EU residents. The AWS European Sovereign Cloud will be logically separated from the existing AWS Regions in Europe, ensuring greater autonomy and control for customers concerned about data sovereignty. This new cloud will adhere to EU regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and will address specific industry and governmental requirements across Europe.
<br/>
The aim of the AWS European Sovereign Cloud is to provide an added layer of assurance for customers who require the highest levels of control over their data and operations. By employing EU-resident personnel and operating independently, AWS seeks to alleviate concerns regarding data access and influence from outside the EU. This move reflects a growing demand for sovereign cloud solutions that offer enhanced data protection and regulatory compliance within the European Union. AWS is investing significantly in this initiative, signaling its commitment to meeting the evolving needs of its European customers and supporting their digital transformation journeys in a secure and compliant manner. The service will be available in 2025.
