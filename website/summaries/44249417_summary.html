<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The article discusses the Sevierville, Tennessee public transit system, named the "Dolly Parton Parkway Transit," colloquially known as "Dolly's Trolley." This system is notable because it operates in a smaller, more rural area compared to larger, urban transit systems typically discussed in transit planning circles. The author highlights the transit system's surprising ridership figures, suggesting that it may be one of the busiest bus routes in the United States based on its length and the size of the community it serves. The success of Dolly's Trolley is attributed to several factors, including the area's strong tourism industry, a large number of hospitality workers who rely on public transit, and the system's free fare policy. The article delves into the specifics of the route, which runs along a major parkway lined with attractions, outlet malls, restaurants, and hotels, catering to both tourists and local employees. Despite its success, the transit system faces challenges such as traffic congestion, which can impact service reliability. The author explores potential strategies to improve the service, including dedicated bus lanes, traffic signal prioritization, and increased frequency. The article also touches on the broader context of public transit in smaller communities, suggesting that Dolly's Trolley could serve as a model for other tourist destinations and areas with a significant number of low-wage workers. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the local context and tailoring transit solutions to meet the specific needs of the community.</p>
