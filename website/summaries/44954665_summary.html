    <h2>Notion releases offline mode</h2>
    <div>
<div>
  <p>Notion allows users to work offline, providing access to previously loaded pages and enabling content creation and editing even without an internet connection. While offline, users can create new pages, edit existing ones, and move content around within Notion. However, certain features such as search, updates from other users, and some embedded content are unavailable until the device reconnects to the internet. Changes made offline are synced to Notion's servers once an internet connection is re-established. Users can track the sync status via an icon in the top right corner of the Notion app. The offline mode is supported on Notion's desktop and mobile apps, ensuring productivity regardless of internet availability. If conflicts arise during syncing, users are prompted to resolve them to ensure data integrity. Notion also provides options for manual conflict resolution. To make a page available offline, it must be visited and fully loaded while the device is online. Large files may not be available offline. Pages with a lock icon are unavailable until online again. Notion's offline capabilities enhance flexibility and ensure continuous access to important information, regardless of internet connectivity.</p>
