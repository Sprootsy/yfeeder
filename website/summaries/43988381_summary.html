  <p>The article is a GitHub repository README file for a project called "muscle-mem" which appears to be a memory allocator written in Rust. The README provides an overview of the project, its goals, usage, and some performance considerations. It outlines that muscle-mem aims to be a high-performance, general-purpose memory allocator, emphasizing speed, low fragmentation, and features tailored for specific use cases. The document compares muscle-mem with other allocators like jemalloc and mimalloc and showcases its superior performance in specific benchmarks. It also details the allocator's API, different usage modes, safety considerations, and configuration options.</p>
