    The article is a letter written by Richard Feynman in 1966 to an unidentified correspondent who had sent him a set of “brain-twister” problems. Feynman responds with a dismissive and somewhat irritated tone, expressing his dislike for such problems and questioning their value. He argues that these types of problems are artificial, divorced from real-world applications, and ultimately a waste of time. He emphasizes that the problems are designed to be tricks rather than genuine challenges that stimulate intellectual growth or creative problem-solving skills.

    Feynman elaborates on his perspective by explaining that he prefers problems that arise naturally from scientific inquiry or real-life situations. He finds value in tackling challenges that lead to a deeper understanding of the world or contribute to practical solutions. In contrast, he views brain-twisters as mere puzzles that offer no lasting benefit or insight.

    He further asserts that the time spent on these problems could be better used for more meaningful intellectual pursuits, such as studying fundamental principles, exploring new ideas, or engaging in creative endeavors. He suggests that genuine problem-solving skills are developed through facing real-world challenges rather than contrived puzzles.

    The letter reveals Feynman's deep-seated belief in the importance of practicality and relevance in intellectual endeavors. He advocates for a problem-solving approach rooted in scientific curiosity and a desire to understand the world, rather than a pursuit of mere intellectual amusement.

  <p>
    In essence, the letter is a critique of the perceived lack of value in artificial brain-teasers, and a defense of Feynman's preference for problems that have practical significance and contribute to a deeper understanding of the natural world. He concludes by politely declining to engage with the problems sent to him, reiterating his belief that such endeavors are not a worthwhile use of his time.
