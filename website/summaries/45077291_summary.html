  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    The arewedecentralizedyet.online website provides a framework for evaluating the decentralization of various blockchain projects. It focuses on Bitcoin and Ethereum, examining decentralization across different layers: protocol development, consensus, and nodes. The website emphasizes that decentralization is a spectrum rather than a binary state, and aims to provide a nuanced view of the degree to which these projects embody decentralized principles.
  </p>
  <p>
    For <b>Bitcoin</b>, the site assesses decentralization in terms of:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Protocol Development:</b> Looks at the number of contributors, the openness of the development process, and the influence of specific individuals or organizations. It acknowledges that while Bitcoin Core has a significant role, there are multiple implementations and contributors, suggesting a reasonable degree of decentralization.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Consensus:</b> Examines the distribution of mining power. The site notes the concentration of mining pools, which presents a centralization risk. However, it also acknowledges that individual miners can choose pools and switch between them, providing some degree of decentralization.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Nodes:</b> Evaluates the distribution of full nodes across different entities and geographical locations. Running a full node is permissionless and anyone can participate in maintaining the network.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For <b>Ethereum</b>, the site evaluates decentralization in terms of:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Protocol Development:</b> Similar to Bitcoin, it assesses the openness and diversity of the development process, acknowledging the prominent role of the Ethereum Foundation while also recognizing the contributions from other teams and individuals.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Consensus:</b> With Ethereum's transition to Proof of Stake (PoS), the consensus mechanism depends on validators. The decentralization of the validators is examined, including the distribution of stake among different entities. The influence of Lido, a large staking pool, is specifically mentioned.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Nodes:</b> Evaluates the distribution of Ethereum nodes. Running an Ethereum node is permissionless and anyone can participate in maintaining the network.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The website explicitly states that its analysis is subjective and based on available information, encouraging community feedback and corrections. The goal is to facilitate informed discussions about the strengths and weaknesses of blockchain projects in relation to the principles of decentralization.
  </p>

  <h3>Key Points</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The website analyzes the decentralization of Bitcoin and Ethereum.
    </li>
    <li>
      Decentralization is evaluated across three layers: protocol development, consensus, and nodes.
    </li>
    <li>
      The analysis acknowledges the varying degrees of decentralization in each layer for both blockchains.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bitcoin's mining pool concentration and Ethereum's staking centralization are highlighted as potential centralization risks.
    </li>
    <li>
      The website encourages community feedback and acknowledges the subjective nature of the assessment.
