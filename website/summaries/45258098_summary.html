    The article "9-16-25-PSVM" by Peter McCue explores the concept of how a particular structure and format in code, specifically relating to the arrangement and use of the `public static void main` (PSVM) method in Java, can influence and shape the entire program or system built around it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The author uses the analogy of how the physical structure of a house or building influences the activities that occur within it to explain how the PSVM method can act as the foundation and framework that dictates the organization and flow of a Java program. Just as the placement of walls, doors, and rooms affects movement and interaction within a building, the structure and conventions surrounding the PSVM method define how different parts of the program interact and contribute to the overall functionality.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article suggests that the seemingly simple and standard PSVM method serves as the entry point and central point of control for a Java application. The way developers structure their code around this entry point can significantly impact the modularity, testability, and maintainability of the entire system. A poorly organized or excessively complex PSVM method can lead to tightly coupled code, making it difficult to understand, modify, and test individual components.
  </p>
  <p>
    Conversely, a well-structured PSVM method can promote loose coupling and separation of concerns, allowing for easier development and maintenance. The article seems to advocate for a design approach that treats the PSVM method as a simple orchestrator, delegating tasks to other well-defined classes and methods. This approach encourages modularity and testability by isolating different functionalities into separate, independent units.
  </p>
  <p>
    The core idea of the article seems to be that the architectural decisions made at the very beginning of a Java project, particularly those related to the structure and role of the PSVM method, can have a profound and lasting impact on the overall quality and maintainability of the codebase. The author encourages developers to consider the broader implications of their design choices and to strive for a clear and well-organized structure that promotes modularity, testability, and maintainability. By carefully considering the role of the PSVM method and its surrounding code, developers can create more robust and flexible Java applications that are easier to understand, modify, and extend over time.
