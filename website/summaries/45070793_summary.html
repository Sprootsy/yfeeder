 <h3>Summary</h3>
 <p>
 The article explores the reasons behind Romania's exceptional performance in international science Olympiads, particularly in mathematics, physics, and computer science. It contrasts Romania's success with the struggles of larger, wealthier nations like the United States, which often underperform relative to their resources. The author attributes Romania's success to a combination of factors, including a historical emphasis on STEM education, a deeply ingrained culture of competition and excellence, and a unique mentorship system that fosters talent from a young age.
 </p>
 <p>
 The article highlights the legacy of Gheorghe Vrănceanu, a prominent Romanian mathematician who, during the communist era, established specialized mathematics high schools and cultivated a system for identifying and nurturing talented students. This system, though initially shaped by the constraints of the communist regime, proved remarkably effective in promoting mathematical prowess. Key to this system was a network of dedicated teachers and mentors who invested significant time and effort in training students for Olympiads. This dedication created a virtuous cycle where successful Olympiad participants later returned to mentor younger generations.

 <p>
 The author points out that Romania's success isn't solely attributable to innate talent but also to a rigorous training regime. Students undergo intense preparation, solving complex problems and mastering advanced concepts well beyond the standard curriculum. This commitment is fueled by a cultural expectation of excellence and a strong sense of national pride. The Olympiads are seen as a significant source of national prestige.

 <p>
 Furthermore, the article suggests that the post-communist transition, despite its challenges, paradoxically reinforced the focus on STEM. Facing economic uncertainty, many Romanians saw education, particularly in STEM fields, as a pathway to upward mobility and international opportunities. The emphasis on STEM, combined with the established structures for identifying and training talent, allowed Romania to maintain its competitive edge in international Olympiads.
 </p>
 <p>
 In contrast, the author criticizes the educational systems in some Western countries, particularly the United States, for prioritizing inclusivity and egalitarianism over cultivating exceptional talent. He argues that the American system often fails to adequately challenge and support gifted students, leading to underperformance in international competitions. The article suggests that the US educational system's focus on standardized testing and broad-based education, rather than specialized training and mentorship, contributes to this relative lack of success.
 </p>
 <p>
 The author concludes that Romania's achievements in international Olympiads are a testament to the power of a dedicated educational system, a culture of excellence, and the importance of mentorship in nurturing talent. It poses a challenge to other nations, particularly those with greater resources, to re-evaluate their approach to STEM education and to consider emulating aspects of the Romanian model.
