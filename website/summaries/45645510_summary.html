<h3>Summary</h3>
The article is a blog post by Fredrik Meyer detailing his self-hosting setup. He outlines the various services and applications he hosts himself, explaining his motivations, the technologies he uses, and the benefits he derives from this approach.

Meyer begins by stating his primary reason for self-hosting: control over his data and services. He doesn't want to rely on third-party companies and their potential privacy issues, data breaches, or service shutdowns. He prefers to manage his own infrastructure and data.

His self-hosting journey started with a Raspberry Pi and has evolved into a more robust setup involving multiple servers and services. He uses Docker and Docker Compose extensively for containerization and orchestration, which simplifies deployment and management. He also utilizes Traefik as a reverse proxy and Let's Encrypt for SSL certificate management, ensuring secure access to his services.

The author then goes into the specifics of what he self-hosts:
<ul>
 <li><strong>Website and Blog:</strong> He hosts his personal website and blog using a static site generator (Hugo) and serves it via Nginx.</li>
 <li><strong>Password Manager:</strong> He uses Bitwarden, a self-hosted password manager, to securely store and manage his passwords.</li>
 <li><strong>File Sync and Sharing:</strong> He uses Nextcloud, a comprehensive self-hosted solution for file storage, synchronization, and sharing, similar to Dropbox or Google Drive.</li>
 <li><strong>Media Server:</strong> He uses Jellyfin to stream media to his devices.</li>
 <li><strong>Photo Management:</strong> He uses Photoprism to organize and share his photos.</li>
 <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> He uses Plausible Analytics, a privacy-focused analytics tool, instead of Google Analytics.</li>
 <li><strong>Link Shortener:</strong> He uses Kutt to shorten URLs.</li>
 <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> He uses Uptime Kuma to monitor his services.</li>
</ul>

Meyer also discusses the hardware he uses for self-hosting, including his servers and Raspberry Pi devices. He emphasizes the importance of backups and has a comprehensive backup strategy in place to protect his data.

He acknowledges that self-hosting requires technical knowledge and effort but believes the benefits of control, privacy, and customization outweigh the costs. He encourages others to explore self-hosting and provides resources and tips for getting started. He also mentions that while self-hosting can save money in some cases, his primary motivation is not cost savings but rather control and privacy.

Finally, Meyer notes that his setup is constantly evolving as he discovers new tools and services that align with his self-hosting goals.
