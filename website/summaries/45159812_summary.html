    <b>Summary:</b>
    According to a senior U.S. customs official, the U.S. government plans to target more businesses suspected of using forced labor in their supply chains following a raid on Hyundai Motor Co.’s parts suppliers. The official, John Leonard, emphasized that companies have a responsibility to ensure their supply chains are free from forced labor, particularly in regions like Xinjiang, China, where there are concerns about human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other minority groups. The U.S. has been enforcing the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), which bans imports from Xinjiang unless companies can prove they were not made with forced labor. Leonard indicated that the government intends to broaden its enforcement efforts beyond specific sectors and focus on companies that fail to conduct adequate due diligence to identify and address forced labor risks in their supply chains. The raid on Hyundai's suppliers is part of a broader effort to hold companies accountable for human rights violations in their supply chains and prevent goods made with forced labor from entering the U.S. market.
