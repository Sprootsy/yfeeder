   According to a Politico article published on September 28, 2025, the Department of Energy (DOE), under the administration of President Ron DeSantis, has reportedly implemented a policy that restricts the use of certain terms related to climate change and emissions in official communications and documents.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article details how career staff members at the DOE have been instructed to avoid using phrases such as "climate change," "clean energy," "emissions reduction," and "environmental justice." Instead, they are encouraged to use alternative phrases that are considered more aligned with the administration's energy priorities. For instance, "climate change" is to be replaced with "weather patterns," "clean energy" with "energy diversity," "emissions reduction" with "energy efficiency improvements," and "environmental justice" with "community enhancements."

  <p>
   Politico's sources within the DOE suggest that this directive is part of a broader effort by the DeSantis administration to shift the focus of the department away from combating climate change and towards promoting fossil fuels and energy independence. Critics of the policy argue that it amounts to censorship and could hinder the DOE's ability to address critical environmental challenges effectively.
  </p>
  <p>
   The article also notes that this policy has caused considerable unease and frustration among DOE staff, particularly those who have dedicated their careers to researching and mitigating climate change. Many fear that the new restrictions will compromise the integrity of their work and undermine public understanding of the climate crisis.

   The DOE has not officially confirmed the existence of the policy. However, several anonymous sources within the department have corroborated the reports, providing examples of instances where the new guidelines have been enforced.
