  <p>A British man, who is claimed to be the most tattooed man in Britain, has reported issues with the new age verification system designed to protect children from accessing adult content online. The man, whose extensive tattoo work covers almost his entire body including his face, says that the AI-powered age check system mistakes his tattoos for a mask. This prevents him from verifying his age and accessing adult websites, specifically pornography. He has tried multiple times, using various methods, but the system consistently fails to recognize his face due to the intricate ink patterns. He claims this is a form of discrimination and highlights the potential biases within AI technology, especially regarding individuals with unconventional appearances.</p>
