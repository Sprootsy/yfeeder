  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The article discusses Igalia's involvement with Valve, particularly their collaboration on improving the Linux gaming experience, specifically in relation to the Steam Deck. The partnership began with Igalia helping Valve with shader pre-caching, an initiative aimed at reducing stuttering during gameplay by pre-compiling shaders. This was a crucial step towards ensuring a smoother gaming experience on Linux, which traditionally faced challenges due to the diverse hardware configurations and the on-demand shader compilation that often led to disruptive stuttering.</p>

  <p>Igalia's work extended beyond shader pre-caching. They collaborated with Valve in several other areas, contributing to the overall improvement of the Linux graphics stack. This included optimizing graphics drivers and Mesa, the open-source graphics library. The goal was to make the Linux gaming experience comparable to or even better than that on Windows. The Steam Deck, with its Linux-based SteamOS, served as a key platform for these improvements, as it provided a consistent hardware target for optimization.</p>

  <p>The collaboration highlights the importance of open-source contributions in the gaming industry. By working on open-source technologies like Mesa, Igalia and Valve were able to benefit the broader Linux ecosystem. This allows other Linux distributions and hardware vendors to benefit from the improvements made for the Steam Deck.</p>

  <p>The article also touches upon the technical aspects of shader compilation and the challenges associated with it on Linux. It explains how shader pre-caching helps to mitigate these issues by offloading the compilation process to a background task, rather than doing it during gameplay. This approach reduces the likelihood of stuttering and improves the overall gaming experience.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the article emphasizes the commitment of both Igalia and Valve to open-source principles and their dedication to improving the Linux gaming ecosystem. Their partnership serves as an example of how collaboration between companies and the open-source community can lead to significant advancements in technology and benefit users.</p>

  <p>In summary, the article showcases Igalia's role in assisting Valve to enhance the Linux gaming experience, primarily through shader pre-caching and other optimizations to the Linux graphics stack. This collaboration has been instrumental in making the Steam Deck a successful gaming platform and has contributed to the broader improvement of Linux gaming.</p>
