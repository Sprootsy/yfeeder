<p>Backblaze, a cloud storage and data backup company, has responded to allegations of "sham accounting" and claims that customer backups are at risk. The claims originated from a report by analyst Matt Cochrane, published on Clouded Judgment. Backblaze has refuted these claims, asserting that they are based on misunderstandings and misinterpretations of the company's financial statements and operational practices.</p>

<p>Cochrane's report raised concerns about Backblaze's accounting methods, particularly regarding the capitalization and depreciation of its storage servers. He argued that Backblaze was extending the depreciable lives of its servers beyond their actual useful lifespan, thereby artificially inflating its profits. He also questioned the company's ability to maintain its service quality and data integrity due to its alleged financial manipulations. He further stated the company's increasing debt was cause for concern and pointed out they were burning through cash at an alarming rate. Furthermore, he claimed that the company's increased reliance on higher-density drives and more aggressive compression techniques could negatively impact the reliability and recoverability of customer data.</p>

<p>Backblaze has strongly denied these allegations. The company defends its accounting practices, stating that it adheres to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and that its depreciation schedules are based on its extensive experience in operating and maintaining storage servers. They argue that their data demonstrates that their servers continue to function reliably well beyond the depreciation periods suggested by Cochrane.</p>

<p>Backblaze has also addressed concerns about its debt and cash flow. The company states that its debt is manageable and that it has a clear plan for achieving profitability. They also contend that their use of high-density drives and compression techniques is carefully managed and does not compromise data integrity.</p>

<p>In its response, Backblaze emphasized its long track record of providing reliable and affordable data backup services. The company highlighted its transparency and commitment to its customers, stating that it is always working to improve its service and protect customer data. Backblaze acknowledged the concerns raised in the report but maintained that these concerns are unfounded and do not reflect the reality of its financial health or operational capabilities.</p>

<p>Essentially, Backblaze is actively pushing back against a report that has questioned their financial health, operational methods, and the safety of customer data. They maintain that their operations are sound, their accounting is above-board, and that customer data remains safe.</p>
