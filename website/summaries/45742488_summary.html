<p>The Keep Android Open project champions the principles of openness and user choice within the Android ecosystem. It emphasizes that Android's success has been built upon its open-source nature, which has fostered innovation, competition, and diverse user experiences. The project aims to protect these fundamental aspects of Android by advocating against practices that could lead to fragmentation, lock-in, and restrictions on user freedom.</p>

<p>The site highlights the importance of a truly open Android platform where users are free to install alternative app stores, customize their devices, and choose the apps they want to use, without undue restrictions imposed by manufacturers or Google. It argues that openness allows for a more level playing field for developers, fostering a wider range of apps and services, and prevents any single entity from controlling the entire ecosystem.</p>

<p>The project expresses concern over potential threats to Android's openness, such as anticompetitive behaviors, proprietary extensions that create walled gardens, and restrictions on sideloading or installing alternative operating systems. It suggests that such measures could stifle innovation, reduce user choice, and ultimately harm the Android ecosystem as a whole.</p>

<p>Keep Android Open actively promotes policies and practices that safeguard Android's open nature. It encourages developers, manufacturers, and policymakers to prioritize user freedom, interoperability, and fair competition within the Android ecosystem. By fostering a vibrant and open environment, the project aims to ensure that Android remains a platform that benefits both users and developers for years to come.</p>

<p>The website further provides resources, news, and analysis related to Android's openness. It serves as a hub for those who believe in the importance of maintaining Android as an open and competitive platform.</p>
