  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The article is a blog post on wedesoft.de about creating a game using Clojure. It details the author's experience of developing a simple game to learn and explore the capabilities of Clojure, a Lisp dialect, in game development. The author shares their motivations, which include wanting to learn Clojure, explore functional programming, and create something fun. The author describes the game as a very basic one, more of a proof-of-concept, built using the Quil library which is a Clojure wrapper for Processing. The article then goes on to provide code snippets demonstrating how the game's logic, drawing, and user interaction are implemented using Clojure and Quil. It explains the core components like the game state, the drawing function, and how the game responds to user input (specifically keyboard presses). Furthermore, the author reflects on their experience, highlighting the challenges and benefits of using Clojure for game development. They discuss the initial learning curve associated with Clojure's syntax and functional approach, but also praise the power and expressiveness of the language once mastered. The author specifically talks about how the immutable data structures and pure functions of Clojure contribute to writing predictable and testable code. The blog post ends with a conclusion that Clojure can indeed be used for game development, especially for simple or prototype games. It suggests that while there might be a steeper learning curve compared to more mainstream game development languages, the benefits of using Clojure, such as its functional programming paradigm and the ability to leverage the Java ecosystem, can make it a worthwhile choice for certain types of projects.</p>
