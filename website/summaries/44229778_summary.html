    <h2>RFK Jr. ousts entire CDC vaccine advisory committee</h2>

<div>
  <p>
    The article discusses concerns raised by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now an independent presidential candidate, regarding vaccine safety and potential conflicts of interest within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and its advisory committee, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Kennedy alleges that vaccines are not as safe as public health officials claim and that financial ties between vaccine manufacturers and ACIP members may influence vaccine recommendations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kennedy specifically points to the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which he argues shields vaccine manufacturers from liability and removes the incentive to produce safer vaccines. He also suggests that the ACIP, responsible for recommending which vaccines should be added to the childhood immunization schedule, is unduly influenced by financial relationships with pharmaceutical companies, creating a situation where profits are prioritized over public health.
  </p>
  <p>
    Medical experts and public health officials dispute Kennedy's claims. They assert that vaccines undergo rigorous testing and monitoring to ensure safety and effectiveness. They acknowledge that while vaccines can cause side effects, serious adverse reactions are rare. The experts also defend the ACIP, stating that its members are carefully vetted for conflicts of interest and that the committee's recommendations are based on scientific evidence. They emphasize the importance of vaccines in preventing serious infectious diseases and protecting public health.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article references numerous studies and reports on vaccine safety, efficacy, and the potential for conflicts of interest within the ACIP. It also mentions that the CDC has implemented measures to address concerns about financial ties between ACIP members and vaccine manufacturers. These measures include disclosure requirements and conflict-of-interest policies.
