  <p>The author, Steve Klabnik, expresses disappointment with the current discourse surrounding AI. Klabnik argues that the conversations are often repetitive, lack nuance, and fail to engage with the core issues or meaningfully advance understanding. The author identifies several recurring themes and problems within this discourse, including a lack of historical awareness of past AI hype cycles and unfulfilled promises, a tendency to focus on either utopian or dystopian extremes while ignoring the messy reality, and a shallow understanding of the technical details and limitations of current AI models. The piece critiques the tendency towards sensationalism and the propagation of misinformation, the conflation of different AI technologies and capabilities, and the lack of critical thinking about the potential societal impacts beyond simplistic job displacement narratives. Klabnik suggests that a more productive conversation would require a deeper understanding of AI's history, technical capabilities, and limitations, as well as a more nuanced and critical examination of its potential societal impacts.</p>
