    <h2>FCC to eliminate gigabit speed goal and scrap analysis of broadband prices</h2>

<p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is planning significant changes to how it assesses broadband availability in the United States. Under the leadership of Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, the FCC intends to eliminate the gigabit speed benchmark, which was previously considered the target speed for broadband deployment. The previous standard, set in 2015, defined broadband as 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload speeds, and the new proposal aims to increase this to 100 Mbps download and 20 Mbps upload speeds. However, the gigabit goal is being dropped, which some critics argue diminishes the ambition for future-proof networks.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the FCC plans to discontinue its analysis of broadband pricing. Previously, the FCC examined whether broadband prices were reasonable and competitive. By ending this analysis, the FCC signals a shift away from direct oversight of broadband affordability. Critics suggest this move could reduce transparency and potentially harm consumers, particularly in areas with limited competition among internet service providers (ISPs).</p>

<p>The proposed changes are part of a broader effort to update the FCC's approach to broadband deployment and accessibility. The updated speed benchmark of 100/20 Mbps is seen as a more realistic reflection of current needs for households and businesses, supporting activities like video conferencing and online education. The FCC argues that focusing on this benchmark will help target resources more effectively to areas that are underserved. The abandonment of the gigabit goal, however, is raising concerns that the US may fall behind other countries in developing advanced, high-speed internet infrastructure.</p>

<p>These changes are occurring against a backdrop of substantial federal investment in broadband infrastructure, including funds allocated through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The FCC's decisions on how to measure and monitor broadband deployment will influence how these funds are distributed and whether they effectively address the digital divide. The elimination of price analysis also raises questions about how the FCC will ensure that broadband remains affordable for all Americans, especially low-income households.</p>

<p>The FCC's announcement has sparked debate among industry stakeholders, consumer advocates, and policymakers. Supporters of the changes argue that they reflect the evolving needs of internet users and will lead to more efficient use of resources. Critics, however, worry that these changes could weaken consumer protections and slow the development of next-generation broadband networks. As the FCC moves forward with these proposals, it will likely face scrutiny from various groups concerned about the future of broadband in the US.</p>
