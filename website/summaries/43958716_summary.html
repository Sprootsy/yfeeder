  <h3>Summary:</h3>
  <p>The article discusses the possibility of replacing the integrated SIM card in newer Tesla vehicles (Model 3 2024+, Model Y 2025+, and Cybertruck) with a custom SIM card. It explores the technical aspects, potential benefits, and challenges associated with this modification. The author details how Tesla's internet connectivity relies on an embedded SIM card, and how that connectivity can be limited or expensive for users, especially when roaming internationally. The author argues that using a custom SIM card could offer cheaper data plans, better network coverage based on the user's preferred provider, and more control over data usage. The core of the modification involves gaining root access to the Tesla's system to reconfigure the modem to use the new SIM card. The author also discusses the risks involved, including voiding the warranty, potential for bricking the car's system, and the technical complexity of the process. The article emphasizes that while this modification is theoretically possible, it's not straightforward and requires advanced technical skills. The author outlines the steps involved, including identifying the modem, gaining root access, configuring the modem, and testing the connectivity. The article also touches on the legal and ethical considerations of modifying a vehicle's embedded systems.</p>
