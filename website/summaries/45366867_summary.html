<p>The Helium Foundation website outlines the Helium Network, a decentralized wireless network powered by blockchain technology. The network aims to provide ubiquitous and affordable connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and, more recently, mobile devices like smartphones. The site details the technology behind the network, its components, and its governance. </p>

<p>The Helium Network initially focused on IoT devices using the LongFi technology, a combination of LoRaWAN and Helium's blockchain. Hotspots, owned and operated by individuals, provide network coverage and are rewarded with HNT, the Helium Network's native cryptocurrency, for doing so. The amount of HNT earned depends on the Hotspot's contribution to the network, such as providing coverage, transferring data, and participating in proof-of-coverage challenges.</p>

<p>The website emphasizes the network's decentralized nature, stating that it is built and maintained by a global community. This decentralization extends to its governance, with community members actively participating in decision-making processes through Helium Improvement Proposals (HIPs). The foundation serves to support and grow the Helium Network.</p>

<p>The Helium Network has expanded beyond IoT with the addition of 5G capabilities. This allows the network to support mobile devices, creating a decentralized alternative to traditional cellular networks. Similar to the IoT network, individuals can deploy 5G hotspots and earn MOBILE tokens for providing coverage and transferring data. This expansion is facilitated by the use of CBRS (Citizens Broadband Radio Service) spectrum.</p>

<p>The site explains the role of different types of hotspots, including data-only hotspots and full hotspots. It also clarifies the tokenomics of the network, including the burning of HNT to obtain Data Credits, which are used to pay for data transfer on the network. With the introduction of 5G, the Helium Network now utilizes two tokens: HNT and MOBILE.</p>

<p>The website presents information about the Helium Foundation, an organization dedicated to the growth and development of the Helium Network. The foundation acts as a steward of the network and works to support its community. It funds development initiatives, advocates for the network, and educates the public about the benefits of decentralized wireless technology.</p>

<p>The website also provides resources for those interested in getting involved with the Helium Network, including documentation, community forums, and information on purchasing hotspots. It highlights the benefits of participating in the network, such as earning HNT or MOBILE tokens, contributing to a decentralized infrastructure, and supporting the growth of IoT and mobile connectivity.</p>

<p>In summary, the Helium Foundation website describes the Helium Network as a decentralized wireless network powered by blockchain technology that provides connectivity for IoT and mobile devices, supported by a global community and incentivized through cryptocurrency rewards.</p>
