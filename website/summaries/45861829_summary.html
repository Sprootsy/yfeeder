<p>A Skagit County Superior Court judge has denied a request to classify data from Flock Safety cameras as exempt from public records requests. The cities of Burlington and Mount Vernon argued that the data should be exempt to protect individuals' privacy, claiming the data could reveal travel patterns and associations. The cities cited the Washington Privacy Act and the Criminal Records Privacy Act, asserting the data constituted sensitive information. </p>

<p>The Skagit Valley Publishing, represented by attorney Michele Earl-Hubbard, opposed the request, arguing that the cities failed to prove the data met the criteria for exemption. Earl-Hubbard contended that the cities did not demonstrate how the data specifically revealed intimate details or associations about individuals. She also highlighted that the cities had not shown how the release of the data would create a risk to individuals. </p>

<p>Judge Brian Stiles sided with Skagit Valley Publishing, stating that the cities did not provide sufficient evidence to justify the exemption. He noted that the cities needed to demonstrate how the specific data requested would violate personal privacy rights or create a risk. The judge's decision means that the data collected by Flock Safety cameras in Burlington and Mount Vernon is subject to public records requests. </p>
