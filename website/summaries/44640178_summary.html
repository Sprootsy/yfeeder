    This article discusses Jane Jacobs' influential but arguably flawed ideas about urban planning, particularly her advocacy for high-density, mixed-use neighborhoods and her opposition to large-scale urban renewal projects. While Jacobs is credited with saving many neighborhoods from demolition and promoting community-based planning, the article argues that her theories have inadvertently contributed to the housing affordability crisis and exclusionary zoning practices in many American cities.

    The author contends that Jacobs' focus on preserving the character of existing neighborhoods and her skepticism towards new construction have led to policies that restrict housing supply, driving up prices and making it difficult for new residents to move in. The article highlights how Jacobs' emphasis on "organic" development and her distrust of centralized planning have been misinterpreted and used to justify NIMBYism (Not In My Backyard) and exclusionary zoning.

    Furthermore, the article points out that Jacobs' ideas were shaped by the specific context of mid-20th century New York City and may not be universally applicable. Her focus on the "sidewalk ballet" and the importance of local businesses may not translate well to other urban environments. The author also suggests that Jacobs' emphasis on diversity within neighborhoods has been misinterpreted to mean preserving the existing social and economic makeup of those neighborhoods, rather than promoting true integration.

    The article concludes that while Jacobs' intentions were noble, her ideas have had unintended consequences and that a more nuanced understanding of urban planning is needed to address the challenges of housing affordability and inequality in modern cities. It calls for a reevaluation of Jacobs' legacy and a move towards policies that promote housing abundance and inclusive growth.
