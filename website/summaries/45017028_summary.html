    According to the article, starting in 2026, Google will require all Android app developers to undergo a stricter verification process. This new process aims to enhance user safety and combat the rise of malicious and low-quality apps in the Google Play Store.
  </p>
  <p>
    The current developer verification process, which primarily focuses on confirming email addresses and basic contact information, has proven insufficient in deterring bad actors. The updated system will involve a more comprehensive examination of developers, including identity verification, business registration details, and past app development history. Google will also require developers to provide detailed information about their apps' functionality, data handling practices, and target audience.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the key changes is the introduction of a "Developer Trust Score." This score will be assigned to each developer based on their verification status, app quality, and adherence to Google Play policies. Developers with higher trust scores will benefit from increased visibility and access to advanced features, while those with lower scores may face stricter scrutiny and limitations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The new verification process will be rolled out in phases, beginning with new developers and those who have previously violated Google Play policies. Existing developers will be given a grace period to comply with the new requirements. Google is also investing in advanced machine learning algorithms to detect suspicious developer behavior and identify potentially harmful apps before they reach users.

    The article highlights that while this stricter verification process may create some additional hurdles for legitimate developers, it is a necessary step to ensure a safer and more trustworthy app ecosystem for Android users. Google believes that by raising the bar for developers, it can significantly reduce the number of malicious and low-quality apps in the Play Store, ultimately improving the overall user experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article also mentions that Google is working on providing developers with resources and support to navigate the new verification process. This includes detailed documentation, online tutorials, and dedicated support channels. Google recognizes that clear communication and guidance are essential to ensure a smooth transition for developers.
