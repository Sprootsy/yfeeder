    <h2>After getting Jimmy Kimmel suspended, FCC chair threatens ABC&#39;s The View</h2>

<p>FCC Chair Brendan Carr is threatening ABC's broadcast license after comments made on "The View" regarding former President Trump. The controversy stems from remarks co-host Whoopi Goldberg made about Trump supporters after he suggested that he would be a dictator "only for a day" if re-elected. Goldberg characterized these supporters as individuals who are okay with dictatorship.
</p>
<p>
Carr has publicly criticized the remarks, stating that ABC might have difficulty meeting the "character qualification" required to hold a broadcast license. He specifically pointed to Section 309(k) of the Communications Act, which allows the FCC to consider the "character of an applicant" when awarding or renewing broadcast licenses.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Carr has publicly called out ABC. He previously urged the FCC to investigate the network after Jimmy Kimmel mocked Donald Trump Jr. Carr suggested that Kimmel's remarks violated federal law which prohibits a broadcaster from censoring a legally qualified candidate's statements on the air.

Critics argue that Carr's actions are politically motivated and represent an attempt to stifle free speech. They contend that the FCC's licensing authority shouldn't be used to punish broadcasters for expressing opinions, even if those opinions are controversial. Others argue that the FCC has a responsibility to ensure that broadcasters are not engaging in the dissemination of misinformation or hate speech.

<p>
The FCC's broadcast licensing authority is broad, but it is subject to First Amendment constraints. The agency's actions are likely to be challenged in court if it attempts to revoke or refuse to renew ABC's broadcast license.
