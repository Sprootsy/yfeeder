<div>
<p>The article describes pgdog, a Rust-based Postgres monitoring agent designed for minimal overhead and maximum observability. It collects and reports a wide range of metrics from Postgres instances, including query performance, resource utilization, and system statistics. pgdog is built with performance in mind, utilizing efficient data collection methods and asynchronous operations to minimize its impact on the monitored database. It supports various output formats, such as Prometheus and Datadog, allowing users to integrate it with existing monitoring infrastructure. The agent is configurable through a YAML file, enabling customization of the collected metrics and reporting intervals.</p>
