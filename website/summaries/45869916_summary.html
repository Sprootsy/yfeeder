    <h2>When Tesla&#39;s FSD works well, it gets credit. When it doesn&#39;t, you get blamed</h2>

 <h2>Summary</h2>
 <p>The Electrek article discusses the current state of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology, framing it as a system with inconsistent reliability. It uses the analogy of Schrödinger's cat to describe the uncertainty of whether FSD will perform well or require immediate driver intervention during any given use. The author recounts personal experiences and observations, highlighting scenarios where FSD functions impressively, navigating complex situations like merging onto highways or handling unusual traffic patterns. However, the article also points out instances where FSD makes critical errors, such as attempting unsafe lane changes or misinterpreting traffic signals, requiring the driver to take control to avoid accidents. These failures demonstrate the technology's unpredictable nature and the necessity for constant driver vigilance. The author emphasizes that while FSD has shown significant improvements over time and can handle many routine driving tasks, it's far from being a fully autonomous system. Drivers must remain prepared to intervene at any moment, making it a system that enhances driving in some situations but simultaneously adds a layer of stress and responsibility due to its potential for sudden and unexpected errors. The article conveys a sense of cautious optimism, acknowledging FSD's progress but also stressing the need for continued development and refinement to achieve true self-driving capabilities. The piece suggests that, for now, FSD is best viewed as an advanced driver-assistance system rather than a fully autonomous solution, with the driver remaining ultimately responsible for the vehicle's safe operation.</p>
