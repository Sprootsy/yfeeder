    The Verge article discusses Meta's plans to integrate AI features into its platforms, specifically focusing on a new AI tool that will be able to access and analyze users' camera rolls to answer questions and provide information. This feature, currently being tested internally, raises significant privacy concerns as it involves granting AI access to a vast collection of personal photos. The AI is designed to identify objects, people, and scenes within the images, allowing users to ask questions like "What outfits have I worn to concerts?" or "Show me pictures of birthday cakes I've made."
