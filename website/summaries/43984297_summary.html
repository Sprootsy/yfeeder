  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article "SMS 2FA Is Not Just Insecure, It's Also Hostile to Mountain People" argues that using SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) is not only a security risk but also particularly problematic for individuals living in mountainous regions or areas with unreliable cellular service. The author contends that relying on SMS for 2FA creates a digital divide, excluding those who lack consistent mobile connectivity.

  <p>
    The article begins by highlighting the well-documented security vulnerabilities of SMS 2FA, such as SIM swapping attacks and interception of text messages. It explains how these vulnerabilities can allow malicious actors to bypass the intended security measures and gain unauthorized access to accounts.

    Beyond the general security concerns, the author emphasizes the specific challenges faced by people in mountainous areas. These regions often have limited or no mobile coverage, making it impossible to receive SMS messages for 2FA. This effectively locks these individuals out of services and platforms that mandate SMS 2FA, such as banking, email, and social media.
  </p>
  <p>
    The author uses the term "hostile" to describe how SMS 2FA disproportionately affects mountain people, creating a digital barrier that excludes them from participating in the digital world. This exclusion exacerbates existing inequalities and limits access to essential services and information.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article advocates for the adoption of more secure and accessible 2FA methods, such as authenticator apps or hardware security keys. These alternatives do not rely on cellular connectivity and offer stronger protection against common security threats. By promoting these alternative methods, the author argues, we can create a more inclusive and secure digital environment for everyone, regardless of their geographic location or access to reliable mobile service. The article also suggests that websites should allow users to select other methods besides SMS 2FA, giving the end-user agency over their security choices.
  </p>
  <p>
    In essence, the article is a call to action for businesses and organizations to move away from SMS 2FA and embrace more inclusive and secure authentication methods that do not discriminate against individuals living in areas with poor cellular coverage.
