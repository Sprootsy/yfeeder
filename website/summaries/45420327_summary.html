<p>The article reports that the FAA has decided to trust Boeing to ensure the safety and compliance of its own aircraft, reversing a previous decision made after two fatal 737 MAX crashes. This decision essentially restores Boeing's authority to self-certify its planes, with the FAA now focusing on audits and oversight rather than direct involvement in the certification process. The move comes after what the FAA considers significant improvements in Boeing's safety culture and quality control processes. Critics, however, express concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the risk of repeating past mistakes where Boeing prioritized profits over safety. The article highlights the FAA's confidence in the changes Boeing has implemented, while also acknowledging the skepticism and apprehension that remain among industry experts and the public.</p>
