  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The article reports on the increasing number of wild boars in urban areas of Japan, particularly in cities like Osaka. These boars, driven by food shortages in their natural habitats due to factors like decreased acorn production linked to climate change, are venturing into residential areas in search of sustenance. This poses a threat to public safety, leading to injuries and property damage. The city of Osaka has responded by increasing its efforts to capture and exterminate the boars, with the number of captured boars rising significantly in recent years. However, simply killing the boars isn't considered a sustainable solution, and there's a growing need for measures to prevent them from entering urban areas in the first place. These measures include improving the management of vacant lots and preventing the dumping of food waste that attracts the animals. The situation is further complicated by the boars' adaptability to urban environments, making them difficult to eradicate. The article highlights the challenges faced by urban areas in dealing with the unexpected presence of these wild animals and the need for comprehensive strategies to address the issue.</p>
