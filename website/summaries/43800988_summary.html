  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>
    The article discusses the growing problem of unattended bicycle parking in Tokyo, particularly around train stations, and the measures being taken to address it.
    Tokyo's urban landscape is increasingly affected by illegally parked bicycles. These bicycles, abandoned near train stations and other public areas, cause obstructions for pedestrians, especially those with disabilities or parents with strollers. This also affects the overall aesthetic appeal and functionality of the city.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tokyo Metropolitan Government has been grappling with this issue for years, implementing various strategies to encourage responsible bicycle parking. The city has invested in constructing more bicycle parking facilities, including automated underground parking systems, to provide convenient and secure alternatives to illegal parking. These facilities are often subsidized to make them affordable for commuters.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enforcement is another key aspect of the city's strategy. Authorities regularly conduct patrols and remove illegally parked bicycles. Owners of impounded bicycles are typically required to pay a fee to retrieve them, which serves as a deterrent.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite these efforts, the problem persists, indicating the need for a multi-faceted approach. The article suggests that raising public awareness about the inconvenience and safety risks associated with illegal bicycle parking is crucial. It also highlights the importance of personal responsibility among cyclists to utilize designated parking areas.

    The article also touches on the design and availability of bicycle parking facilities, pointing out that convenience and accessibility are key factors in encouraging their use. The automated underground parking systems, while effective in terms of space utilization, need to be strategically located and user-friendly to attract cyclists.

    The problem of unattended bicycle parking is portrayed as a complex issue requiring ongoing efforts from both the government and individual citizens to maintain order and safety in Tokyo's public spaces.
