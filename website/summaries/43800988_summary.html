  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The Mainichi Shimbun article reports on the growing problem of elderly drivers in Japan causing accidents, particularly those involving pedestrians and cyclists. With Japan's rapidly aging population, the number of elderly drivers is increasing, leading to a rise in accidents attributed to age-related cognitive and physical decline. The article highlights several recent incidents where elderly drivers were responsible for serious or fatal accidents. These incidents have sparked public concern and reignited the debate about measures to prevent such tragedies. The article discusses potential solutions, including stricter license renewal requirements for elderly drivers, increased testing of cognitive functions, promoting the surrender of driver's licenses, and improving public transportation options in rural areas to reduce reliance on personal vehicles. The article also touches upon the challenges of implementing these measures, such as the dependence on cars in rural communities where public transport is limited and the reluctance of elderly individuals to give up their driving independence, which provides them with mobility and social connection. The article emphasizes the need for a multifaceted approach that combines stricter regulations, technological advancements, and community support to ensure the safety of all road users.</p>
