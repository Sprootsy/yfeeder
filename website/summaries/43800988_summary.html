  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The article reports on the ongoing controversy surrounding the planned relocation of the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in Ginowan, Okinawa Prefecture, to the Henoko district of Nago, within the same prefecture. Despite strong local opposition, the Japanese central government is proceeding with construction. The article focuses on the discovery of further weaknesses in the seabed at the planned relocation site, requiring additional reinforcement work and potentially leading to significant delays and increased costs.

  <p>
    The Okinawa Prefectural Government has consistently opposed the relocation, arguing that the base should be moved outside of Okinawa altogether, as the island already hosts a disproportionate number of U.S. military facilities. They cite concerns about noise, environmental impact, and the risk of accidents. The prefectural government has used various legal and political means to try to block the construction.

    The central government maintains that the Henoko relocation is the only viable option, and is essential for maintaining the U.S.-Japan alliance and ensuring regional security. They argue that the Futenma base is dangerously located in a densely populated area, and that moving it to Henoko will improve safety.

    The discovery of the soft seabed has further complicated the already contentious issue. The central government has applied for design changes to address the problem, but the Okinawa Prefectural Government has refused to approve them, leading to legal battles. The article notes that expert analysis indicates that the necessary reinforcement work could be technically challenging and very expensive, possibly costing trillions of yen and taking many years to complete. This raises questions about the feasibility of the Henoko relocation plan. The article highlights that the central government's insistence on the Henoko plan, despite the geological challenges and strong local opposition, is a major point of contention between the central government and the Okinawa Prefectural Government.
