    <h2>OpenBSD is so fast, I had to modify the program slightly to measure itself</h2>

<p>The article is a blog post by Ted Unangst discussing claims circulating online that OpenBSD is significantly faster (10x) than Linux. Unangst investigates the origin of these claims and analyzes the methodology and context behind benchmarks that might suggest such a performance difference. He focuses on the anecdote that OpenBSD "felt faster" back when the author switched to it. He clarifies that this feeling likely stemmed from specific workload scenarios where OpenBSD's design choices, such as a simpler and less feature-laden kernel, offered an advantage. He explains that Linux, in its pursuit of broader hardware support and a wider range of use cases, has accumulated more complexity and drivers, which can introduce overhead.

<p>Unangst critiques the idea of a blanket "10x faster" statement, emphasizing that performance is highly dependent on the specific workload and hardware configuration. He notes that the original claims likely originated from observations in specific areas like packet filtering with pf, where OpenBSD has historically been recognized for its efficiency. The author also uses an analogy where he compares a highly specialized tool versus a general-purpose tool with extra added functionalities. Unangst also investigates other potential performance influences such as compiler differences (GCC vs Clang) and security mitigations.

<p>Ultimately, the article concludes that while OpenBSD might exhibit performance advantages in certain niche scenarios due to its simpler design and specific optimizations, it is inaccurate and misleading to claim a general 10x speed advantage over Linux. Modern Linux systems are highly optimized and can outperform OpenBSD in many other scenarios. The choice between the two operating systems should be based on specific requirements and priorities rather than a simplistic notion of overall speed.</p>
