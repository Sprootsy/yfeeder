    <h2>OpenBSD is so fast, I had to modify the program slightly to measure itself</h2>

<p>The article is a blog post by Ted Unangst addressing a claim that OpenBSD is ten times faster than Linux. Unangst expresses skepticism about such a claim, particularly without specific context or benchmarks. He suggests that blanket statements about operating system performance are generally misleading due to the wide variety of workloads and hardware configurations. He uses a personal anecdote about optimizing a specific workload on OpenBSD which resulted in an approximately 10x performance improvement as an example of how targeted optimization can yield significant gains in specific scenarios but not represent the overall performance characteristics of the operating system.</p>
<p>He clarifies that while OpenBSD may have architectural differences or default settings that could lead to performance advantages in certain cases, it is unlikely to be universally ten times faster than Linux. He points out the importance of understanding the specific problem being addressed and the factors influencing performance when comparing operating systems. He further notes that it is more likely that targeted optimization of a specific workload is what led to the claim.</p>
<p>Unangst concludes by reiterating that broad claims about one operating system being significantly faster than another are often inaccurate and that performance is highly dependent on the specifics of the application, hardware, and configuration.</p>
