<p>A second data leak has been reported for the Tea app, a package manager and decentralized app store for Linux, macOS, and WASM, further compounding its security issues. This new leak exposes user chats and builds upon a previous incident where the app's entire database was leaked. The initial leak contained sensitive user data such as usernames, email addresses, hashed passwords, API keys, and more. The second leak reveals private conversations between users, adding a new layer of privacy violation.
</p>
<p>According to security researcher Troy Hunt, the initial data breach was substantial, affecting a significant number of users. The leaked data was added to the "Have I Been Pwned" service, allowing users to check if their information was compromised. While the passwords were hashed, the use of bcrypt as the hashing algorithm doesn't guarantee complete security, particularly if users employed weak or reused passwords.
</p>
<p>The second leak of user chats raises further concerns about the app's security practices and its ability to protect user data. The combination of these two incidents paints a worrying picture for the Tea app and its users, highlighting the need for robust security measures to prevent future breaches and protect sensitive information. The article emphasizes the importance of users checking "Have I Been Pwned" to see if their data has been compromised and to take necessary precautions such as changing passwords, especially if they were reused across multiple platforms.
