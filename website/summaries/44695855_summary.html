  <p>This article investigates the impact of human activities on soil erosion rates since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), approximately 21,000 years ago. The study employs a global compilation of sediment accumulation rates from various depositional environments like lakes, floodplains, and coastal areas. By comparing pre-LGM and post-LGM sediment accumulation rates, the researchers quantify the acceleration of soil erosion attributed to human activities, primarily agriculture and deforestation. The analysis reveals a significant increase in soil erosion rates worldwide following the onset of agriculture, with the most pronounced changes observed in regions with intensive land use and high population densities. The study also examines the spatial variability of human-induced soil erosion, highlighting hotspots where erosion rates have increased dramatically. The results indicate that human activities have become the dominant driver of soil erosion globally, surpassing natural processes in many regions. Furthermore, the authors discuss the implications of accelerated soil erosion for ecosystem services, carbon cycling, and long-term landscape evolution. The study underscores the urgent need for sustainable land management practices to mitigate soil erosion and protect soil resources for future generations.</p>
