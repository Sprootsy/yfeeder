    <h2>Deadly Screwworm Parasite&#39;s Comeback Threatens Texas Cattle, US Beef Supply</h2>

   <h3>Summary</h3>
   <p>
     A screwworm outbreak in the Florida Keys in 2016 prompted emergency measures to prevent the parasite from spreading into the mainland US, particularly Texas. Screwworms, the larvae of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly, feed on the living flesh of warm-blooded animals, causing severe tissue damage and potential death. They had been eradicated from the US by the 1960s through the release of sterile flies that disrupted the insect's reproductive cycle. However, isolated outbreaks still occur, mainly due to animals crossing borders from infested countries.
   </p>
   <p>
     The 2016 outbreak in Florida cost approximately $3.5 million to eradicate. Texas is particularly vulnerable due to its large livestock population and proximity to Mexico, where screwworms are still present. A re-establishment of screwworms in Texas could have devastating economic consequences for the state's cattle industry, which is the largest in the United States.
   </p>
   <p>
     Texas A&amp;M University's screwworm research program is crucial for detecting and responding to potential outbreaks. The program uses traps baited with a chemical attractant to monitor for the presence of screwworms. Early detection is essential for rapid response efforts, such as releasing sterile flies and treating affected animals.

   <p>
     The sterile fly technique involves irradiating male screwworm flies, rendering them infertile but still able to mate. When these sterile males mate with wild females, the females lay infertile eggs, gradually reducing the population. This method is environmentally friendly and has been highly successful in past eradication efforts.
   </p>
   <p>
     The article emphasizes the importance of continued vigilance and investment in screwworm monitoring and control programs to protect the US livestock industry. The threat of screwworms is ongoing, and complacency could lead to a resurgence with severe economic and animal welfare consequences.
