  <p>Extropic is a company focused on developing compute substrates that directly harness physics for computation, moving beyond the limitations of traditional digital computing. They are building intrinsically non-digital computers leveraging the physics of self-organizing systems to achieve greater efficiency, speed, and new computational capabilities. Their approach involves "thermodynamic programming," which treats computation as a physical process of entropy reduction, allowing for the design of algorithms that are natively parallel, stochastic, and capable of operating near thermodynamic limits. Extropic believes this approach is crucial for addressing the growing computational demands of advanced AI, which are currently constrained by the energy costs and inherent inefficiencies of digital architectures.</p>

  <p>The company aims to create a new computing paradigm that can handle the complexities of modern machine learning and future AI applications. By exploring physical computation, Extropic hopes to enable new classes of algorithms and unlock capabilities that are fundamentally inaccessible to digital computers. They emphasize that computation is at its core a physical process, and that by embracing this, it's possible to design more efficient and powerful computing systems. This includes utilizing physical phenomena for computation, developing new programming models tailored to these physical systems, and rethinking the entire computational stack from the ground up.</p>

  <p>Extropic's vision involves moving away from the von Neumann architecture which separates processing and memory, toward systems where computation and memory are intertwined and based on physical dynamics. This allows for greater parallelism and energy efficiency. The company's research spans several areas, including non-equilibrium thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and complex systems, to understand and exploit the computational potential of physical systems. They are essentially building computers that are not programmed in the traditional sense, but rather are designed to evolve and self-organize to solve computational problems. This approach has the potential to revolutionize fields such as AI, optimization, and simulation, where the demands for computational power are ever-increasing.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, Extropic is trying to enable a future where computation is no longer limited by the constraints of digital hardware, paving the way for new discoveries and technologies that would otherwise be impossible. This vision is based on the idea that the physical world itself can be a computer, and that by understanding and harnessing its inherent computational capabilities, we can unlock unprecedented levels of performance and efficiency.</p>
