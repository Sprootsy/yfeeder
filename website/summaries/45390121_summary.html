  <p>This email discusses the transition of the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) to a new secretariat support model. The current secretariat support, provided by RSA Conference LLC, is ending, and a new Request for Proposal (RFP) process was initiated to find a new provider. Three proposals were received, and after a thorough evaluation process by the IETF Administration LLC (IAD) Board and external advisors, the proposal from AMS (American Mathematical Society) was selected. The email announces this selection and outlines the next steps in the transition. These steps include contract negotiation with AMS, developing a detailed transition plan, and ongoing communication with the IETF community throughout the process. The goal is to ensure a smooth and transparent transition with minimal disruption to IETF operations. The author expresses gratitude to RSA Conference LLC for their years of service and looks forward to a successful partnership with AMS.</p>
