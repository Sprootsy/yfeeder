  <h3>Summary:</h3>
  <p>
   The article is a personal account of the author's experience in transitioning Microsoft Office from a traditional, monolithic build and release process to a Git-based system with a focus on improving the developer experience (DevEx). The author highlights the challenges and benefits of this significant shift, emphasizing the impact on developer productivity, collaboration, and the overall software development lifecycle.

  <p>
   Initially, Office relied on a complex system involving a massive codebase, a single source control system (likely Source Depot or a similar centralized VCS), and a build process that took a considerable amount of time. Developers faced difficulties with branching, merging, and code integration, leading to bottlenecks and delays. The article describes the effort to break down this monolithic system and adopt Git, a distributed version control system, which allowed for more flexible branching strategies, faster local operations, and improved collaboration.

   The author emphasizes the importance of tooling and automation in making this transition successful. They discuss the creation of internal tools and processes to streamline Git workflows, such as pull request management, code review, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD). These tools aimed to abstract away the complexities of Git and provide developers with a more intuitive and efficient experience. Furthermore, the article touches on the cultural shift required to embrace Git and the new development practices it enabled. This included training developers on Git, promoting a culture of code review and collaboration, and fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility.

   The article also addresses the challenges encountered during the migration. Dealing with the sheer size of the Office codebase presented significant technical hurdles. The author describes strategies used to optimize Git performance, such as shallow clones and sparse checkouts. Ensuring backward compatibility with existing systems and workflows was another crucial consideration. The transition involved a gradual rollout, with different teams adopting Git at their own pace. This approach allowed for continuous feedback and adjustments, minimizing disruption to ongoing development efforts.

   The author expresses a strong appreciation for the positive impact of this transformation on developer experience. Git enabled faster iteration cycles, improved code quality, and increased developer satisfaction. The ability to experiment with new ideas and collaborate more effectively led to significant improvements in Office's features and functionality. The article also underscores the importance of investing in developer tooling and infrastructure to create a more productive and enjoyable development environment. The author clearly values DevEx as a key factor in attracting and retaining top talent and driving innovation.
