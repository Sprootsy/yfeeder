<h3>Summary</h3>
The article "Joining Apple Computer" by Andy Hertzfeld recounts his experiences joining Apple Computer in 1979 and provides a glimpse into the company's culture and the development of the Macintosh. Hertzfeld, initially a graduate student at Berkeley, was drawn to Apple due to his interest in personal computing and the innovative spirit surrounding the Apple II. He describes how he initially started working part-time at Apple, writing printer drivers, before eventually becoming a full-time employee.

Hertzfeld emphasizes the unique and unconventional atmosphere at Apple during its early years. The company was filled with young, passionate individuals who were deeply committed to their work and driven by a desire to create groundbreaking technology. He highlights the informal and collaborative environment, where programmers were given a lot of freedom and autonomy. This freedom fostered creativity and allowed engineers to experiment and push the boundaries of what was possible.

The article details the development of the Macintosh, which was a highly secretive project. Jef Raskin initiated the Macintosh project, aiming to create an affordable and user-friendly computer. Hertzfeld joined the Macintosh team relatively early and played a significant role in developing the system software. He collaborated closely with other key members of the team, including Steve Jobs, Bill Atkinson, and Burrell Smith.

Hertzfeld describes Steve Jobs's influence on the Macintosh project. Jobs, although not a programmer himself, had a strong vision for the Macintosh and pushed the team to create a truly revolutionary product. He was known for his demanding personality and his ability to inspire and motivate the team to achieve seemingly impossible goals. Hertzfeld recounts instances where Jobs challenged the team to make the Macintosh faster, simpler, and more elegant.

The article also touches on the technical challenges and breakthroughs involved in developing the Macintosh. The team faced limitations in memory and processing power but overcame these obstacles through innovative programming techniques and hardware design. They created a graphical user interface (GUI) that was intuitive and easy to use, which set the Macintosh apart from other computers of the time. The development of QuickDraw, a fast and efficient graphics library, was particularly crucial for the Macintosh's success.

Hertzfeld describes the intense dedication and long hours that the Macintosh team poured into the project. They were driven by a shared belief in the potential of the Macintosh and a desire to change the world through technology. The article captures the excitement and camaraderie that characterized the Macintosh team during this period.

Finally, the article concludes with the launch of the Macintosh in 1984, which was a pivotal moment in the history of personal computing. The Macintosh introduced many groundbreaking features, including the GUI, the mouse, and WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) text editing, that would become standard in personal computers.
