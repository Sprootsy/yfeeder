**Summary:**

The article details the case of a U.S. citizen in Arizona, Lorenzo Palma, who was mistakenly detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for 10 days. Palma, a Tucson resident, was pulled over by local law enforcement for a traffic violation. During the stop, the officers questioned Palma about his immigration status, despite him presenting a valid Arizona driver&#39;s license. They then contacted ICE, who took Palma into custody based on what turned out to be incorrect information.

Palma was held in an ICE detention facility where he repeatedly asserted his U.S. citizenship and provided documentation to support his claim, including his birth certificate. Despite this, ICE officials did not immediately release him. Palma&#39;s attorney, James Lyall, believes that ICE failed to properly verify Palma&#39;s citizenship, leading to his unlawful detention.

After 10 days, Palma was finally released, but the experience left him traumatized and seeking answers about why he was detained in the first place. Advocates and legal experts are concerned about this case, seeing it as an example of potential racial profiling and the risks of local law enforcement collaborating with ICE to enforce federal immigration laws. They argue that such collaborations can lead to the wrongful detention of U.S. citizens and legal residents, undermining trust between communities and law enforcement.

The article highlights the ongoing debate about immigration enforcement policies and the need for greater oversight and accountability to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. Palma is now considering legal action against ICE for his wrongful detention.
