  <p>The article is a README file for a GitHub repository named "cactoide" by polaroi8d. Cactoide is described as a lightweight C++ header-only library for creating terminal user interfaces (TUIs). It aims to provide a declarative and reactive approach to TUI development, inspired by web frameworks such as React. The library emphasizes simplicity, ease of use, and cross-platform compatibility, supporting Linux, macOS, and Windows.
  </p>
  <p>
  The README outlines the core concepts behind Cactoide. It highlights the use of a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update the terminal display, rendering only the necessary changes. It describes the component-based architecture, where UI elements are built from reusable components that manage their own state. The library leverages the terminal_api library for low-level terminal manipulation.
  </p>
  <p>
  The article illustrates the use of Cactoide with a basic example of a "Hello, world!" application. It shows the structure of a component, which includes a state (data) and a render function that defines the visual representation based on the state. The library employs a layout system based on flexbox to arrange components within the terminal window. It supports event handling (e.g., key presses) to enable interactive TUIs. The README also touches upon styling and theming, allowing developers to customize the appearance of their applications. It mentions that the library is still under development, so breaking changes may occur.
  </p>
  <p>
  The installation section of the README provides instructions on how to integrate Cactoide into a C++ project. Being header-only, it primarily involves including the Cactoide header files in the project. It also mentions the dependencies needed, such as the terminal_api library and CMake for building examples.
  </p>
  <p>
  The documentation section points to a separate documentation website for more in-depth information about the library's features and usage. The contributing section encourages users to contribute to the project through bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. The license is specified as MIT. The README includes a "Showcase" section where users can showcase applications made with Cactoide.
