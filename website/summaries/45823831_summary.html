    <h2>Ruby and Its Neighbors: Smalltalk</h2>

  <p>This blog post discusses the relationship between Ruby and Smalltalk, highlighting Smalltalk as a significant influence on Ruby's design and philosophy. It emphasizes that while many are aware of Ruby's connections to Lisp and Perl, the link to Smalltalk is often overlooked. The author details several key similarities between the two languages, including the concept of message passing, where all operations are essentially sending messages to objects. This extends to even basic operations like arithmetic, which are implemented as messages sent to number objects. The post illustrates this with examples showing how <code>3 + 4</code> in Ruby and Smalltalk are conceptually the same: the number 3 receives the message <code>+</code> with the argument 4.</p>

  <p>The article also touches upon the elegance and uniformity that this message-passing paradigm brings to both languages. It points out that control structures like loops and conditionals are also implemented using message passing, making the language more consistent and flexible. For instance, an <code>if</code> statement is not a special language construct but a message sent to a boolean object. The author provides code snippets to demonstrate how these constructs are implemented in Smalltalk, showcasing the underlying message-passing mechanism. The post contrasts this approach with languages like C++ or Java, where operators and control structures are distinct language elements.</p>

  <p>Further, the blog post delves into the object-oriented nature of both languages, emphasizing that in Smalltalk and Ruby, everything is an object. This contrasts with languages that have primitive data types that are not objects. The author notes that this object-centric design contributes to the dynamic and reflective capabilities of both languages, allowing for metaprogramming and runtime modification of object behavior. The post also mentions the influence of Smalltalk on the design of Ruby's blocks, which are similar to Smalltalk's blocks of code that can be passed around and executed.</p>

  <p>The article concludes by advocating for a deeper understanding of Smalltalk among Ruby programmers, suggesting that it can provide valuable insights into the underlying principles of Ruby and enhance one's programming skills. By recognizing the shared heritage and design philosophies, Rubyists can gain a broader perspective on object-oriented programming and language design. The author encourages readers to explore Smalltalk to appreciate its elegance and influence on modern programming languages like Ruby.</p>
