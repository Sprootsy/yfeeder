<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The article from Rwandan Stories discusses the role of Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM) in inciting the Rwandan genocide in 1994. RTLM, a radio station broadcasting in Rwanda, played a significant part in the escalation of violence by disseminating hate speech and propaganda against the Tutsi population. The radio station was founded in 1993 by individuals associated with the ruling MRND party, and quickly became a popular media outlet due to its mix of music, news, and political commentary. However, RTLM distinguished itself by its overt ethnic bias, consistently portraying Tutsis as enemies of the Hutu majority. </p>
<p>The station used derogatory terms to dehumanize Tutsis, referring to them as "cockroaches" (inyenzi) and accusing them of conspiring to overthrow the Hutu government. It also identified specific individuals and locations where Tutsis could be found, effectively providing a roadmap for the Interahamwe militia and ordinary citizens to carry out the genocide. RTLM’s broadcasts fueled fear and paranoia among the Hutu population, convincing many that the Tutsis posed an existential threat. The radio station amplified the existing ethnic tensions in Rwanda, which had historical roots in the colonial era and had been exacerbated by political opportunism.</p>
<p>During the genocide, RTLM became a crucial tool for coordinating and directing the massacres. It announced the names of people to be killed, celebrated the progress of the killings, and encouraged Hutus to participate actively. The radio station acted as a mouthpiece for extremist factions within the government and the Interahamwe militia, effectively turning public airwaves into a weapon of mass destruction. The broadcasts also targeted moderate Hutus who opposed the violence or attempted to protect Tutsis, labeling them as traitors and collaborators. The impact of RTLM was profound. With limited access to alternative sources of information, many Rwandans relied on the radio station for news and guidance. The constant barrage of hate propaganda desensitized listeners to violence and normalized the idea of exterminating the Tutsi population.</p>
<p>After the genocide, several key figures associated with RTLM were brought before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) to face charges of incitement to genocide and crimes against humanity. The convictions of these individuals highlighted the significant role that media can play in promoting or preventing mass atrocities. The case of RTLM serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of hate speech and the importance of media responsibility in conflict situations. It also underscores the need for international mechanisms to hold those who use media to incite violence accountable for their actions.</p>
