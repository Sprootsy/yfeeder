  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>
   The article reports that fully driverless semi-trucks have begun operating on regular commercial routes in Texas. These trucks, operated by companies like Aurora and Kodiak, are transporting goods for clients such as FedEx and Werner. While the trucks currently operate on specific, pre-mapped routes, the commencement of these driverless operations marks a significant milestone in the autonomous vehicle industry.

   Aurora has launched its "Connect" service between Dallas and Houston, a nearly 300-mile stretch, with plans to expand to other routes. Kodiak is also running autonomous routes, focusing on safety and efficiency. Both companies emphasize rigorous testing and safety protocols to ensure the safe operation of these driverless trucks. While the trucks are currently limited to highways and specific weather conditions, the long-term vision is to expand their operational capabilities and reduce reliance on human drivers.

   The introduction of driverless trucks has the potential to address the ongoing driver shortage in the trucking industry, improve efficiency, and reduce transportation costs. However, it also raises concerns about job displacement for truck drivers and the potential safety risks associated with autonomous vehicles. The companies involved are working closely with regulators and stakeholders to address these concerns and ensure a smooth transition to a future with autonomous trucking.
