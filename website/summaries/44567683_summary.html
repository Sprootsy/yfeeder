<p>The article "The New Literalism Plaguing Today's Biggest Movies" in The New Yorker discusses a trend in modern blockbuster filmmaking towards excessive explicitness and a lack of subtlety, ambiguity, and reliance on audience interpretation. The author argues that contemporary cinema over-explains narratives, characters, and themes, leaving little to the imagination and diminishing the viewer's active engagement. This "new literalism" manifests in several ways, including dialogue that explicitly states a character's motivations or the plot's meaning, visual storytelling that redundantly repeats information already conveyed through other means, and a general avoidance of subtext or nuance.</p>

<p>The author posits that this trend is driven by a combination of factors. These include the dominance of franchise filmmaking, which often prioritizes accessibility and broad appeal over artistic risk-taking; the influence of television writing, which tends to favor clear and concise exposition due to the episodic format; and a perceived need to cater to increasingly distracted or impatient audiences who may be consuming content on smaller screens or while multitasking. Furthermore, the globalization of the film market necessitates a level of clarity that transcends cultural barriers, potentially leading to the simplification of narratives and the reduction of culturally specific references.</p>

<p>The piece suggests that this over-explicitness ultimately undermines the power of cinema as an art form. By removing the need for interpretation and critical thinking, films become less engaging and memorable. The author laments the loss of subtlety and the erosion of the viewer's role in constructing meaning. Films that spoon-feed every detail leave little room for emotional resonance or intellectual stimulation. The article also touches on the economic incentives that may be at play, suggesting that studios are hesitant to take risks on more ambiguous or challenging narratives, fearing that they may alienate a portion of their audience and impact box office returns.</p>

<p>The author provides examples of recent blockbuster films that exemplify this trend, highlighting specific scenes and dialogue exchanges where characters explicitly state the obvious or where visual elements unnecessarily reinforce information already presented. These examples serve to illustrate the pervasiveness of this "new literalism" and its impact on the overall cinematic experience. The piece suggests that this trend is not only aesthetically unappealing but also potentially detrimental to the future of filmmaking, as it may stifle creativity and discourage audiences from engaging with films on a deeper, more meaningful level.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the article serves as a critique of the current state of blockbuster filmmaking, arguing that the pursuit of clarity and accessibility has come at the expense of artistic integrity and audience engagement. The author calls for a return to more subtle and nuanced storytelling, where viewers are trusted to actively participate in the creation of meaning and where films are allowed to be ambiguous, challenging, and thought-provoking.</p>
