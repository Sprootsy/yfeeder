The proposed takeover has sparked significant controversy and community opposition, with concerns raised about the potential for reduced services, staff cuts, and a shift in focus from community needs to profit. The article details the history of RCPL, highlighting its importance to the rural community it serves. It emphasizes the library's role as a vital resource for internet access, educational programs, and community engagement, especially for those who may not have these resources at home. The article also presents the perspective of the Rappahannock County Board of Supervisors, who are considering the proposal from LS&amp;S.
