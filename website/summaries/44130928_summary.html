    <h2>SQL Workbench â€“ Republicans not welcome</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p>SQL Workbench/J is a free, DBMS-agnostic, open-source SQL query tool. It is written in Java and should run on any operating system that supports Java. It is primarily aimed at developers who need to work with different database systems. The software is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, meaning it is free to use, even for commercial purposes. The application is designed to have a small footprint and is distributed as a single .jar file. It requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8 or higher.</p>

<p>SQL Workbench/J's core functionality revolves around executing SQL queries and scripts. It provides a user interface for connecting to various database systems, executing SQL statements, and viewing the results. It supports features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and statement history. Users can manage multiple database connections simultaneously. The tool supports importing and exporting data in different formats. Additionally, it has features for comparing data between databases and generating database documentation.</p>

<p>The software supports a wide array of database systems through JDBC drivers. It doesn't come bundled with any JDBC drivers, so users must download and configure the appropriate drivers for their specific database systems. The application provides tools to help manage and configure these drivers. Some of the supported databases include PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, and others. The generic JDBC driver allows it to connect to any database that has a JDBC driver.</p>

<p>SQL Workbench/J is designed to be extensible. It supports plugins that can add additional functionality. The scripting functionality allows automation of tasks and customization of the tool's behavior. It supports the use of Groovy scripts to extend its functionality.</p>

<p>The application has a graphical user interface (GUI) but can also be used from the command line, which is useful for scripting and automation. Command-line options allow for executing SQL scripts, exporting data, and performing other tasks without direct user interaction. This makes it suitable for integration into automated build and deployment processes.</p>

<p>SQL Workbench/J is actively maintained and updated. The website provides documentation, a user manual, and a FAQ section. It also provides a community forum for users to ask questions and share knowledge. It is available for download from the SQL Workbench/J website.</p>
