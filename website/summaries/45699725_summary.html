    The article discusses a new proposed file format for OpenStreetMap (OSM) data that aims to be significantly smaller and faster to import compared to the existing PBF (Protocolbuffer Binary Format) format. The new format achieves a size reduction of approximately 30% compared to PBF and boasts import speeds that are up to 5 times faster.

    The author, Daniel, introduces the new file format and highlights its key advantages in terms of storage efficiency and processing speed. The motivation behind developing this new format stems from the desire to improve the overall efficiency of working with large OSM datasets. While PBF has been a standard for quite some time, there's always room for improvement, especially as OSM data continues to grow. The new file format seems to be designed with both storage space and processing time as primary considerations, which are critical factors for anyone dealing with large-scale geospatial data.

    The article mentions that the improvements are achieved through some form of optimization. However, the specifics of these optimizations are not detailed in the article.

    The discussion thread includes various user reactions, with some expressing skepticism. One user is worried that a new format might fragment the ecosystem, causing extra work and maintenance. They suggest looking at alternatives like zstandard to compress existing formats. Another user would prefer a new format to be based on an existing standard.

    The user, someoneElse, is more optimistic, and requests benchmarks against up-to-date PBF files, and asks about the type of compression being used, licensing, and if the format supports streaming.
  </p>

    Other users raise concerns about tooling support and the potential disruption caused by introducing a new format into the OSM ecosystem. These are all valid concerns, as the adoption of a new format would require updates to existing software and workflows. The trade-off between the benefits of the new format (size and speed) and the costs of transition (tooling, disruption) would need to be carefully considered.
