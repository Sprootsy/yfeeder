  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>A massive data breach has exposed 184 million passwords, usernames, and other sensitive data from a variety of online services, including Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and others. The breach, dubbed the "Naz.API" breach, was discovered by researchers at Cybernews, who found the data being sold on a dark web forum. The compromised data includes plaintext passwords, NTLM hashes, and SHA256 hashes, making it easier for attackers to crack the passwords and gain access to user accounts. The breach appears to be an aggregation of previously exposed data from various sources, rather than a new breach of a single service. This highlights the importance of using strong, unique passwords for each online account and enabling multi-factor authentication whenever possible.</p>
