<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>A new review article from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign suggests that social drinking is a significant pathway to alcohol use disorder (AUD). The researchers analyzed existing studies on the transition from social drinking to AUD and found that social contexts, drinking motives, and individual differences play crucial roles in this progression. The review challenges the common perception of AUD as primarily stemming from solitary or problematic drinking, highlighting the importance of considering social drinking as a potential risk factor. The article emphasizes that social drinking norms, peer influence, and the rewarding effects of alcohol in social settings can gradually lead to increased consumption and dependence. Furthermore, the review discusses the role of impulsivity, anxiety sensitivity, and other personality traits in shaping an individual's susceptibility to developing AUD through social drinking. Ultimately, the researchers advocate for a more nuanced understanding of AUD etiology, acknowledging the significant contribution of social drinking and urging for targeted prevention and intervention strategies that address the social contexts and motivations underlying alcohol consumption.</p>
