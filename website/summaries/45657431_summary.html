    This article argues that public trust in elections demands open-source voting systems. It highlights the vulnerabilities of proprietary voting machines, which are often black boxes with code that is not publicly accessible for review. This lack of transparency raises concerns about security, accuracy, and the potential for manipulation. The article asserts that open-source systems, where the code is publicly available, allow for independent audits, security testing, and verification by experts and the public, thereby increasing trust and confidence in election outcomes.

    The article contrasts the transparency of hand-marked paper ballots with the opacity of electronic voting machines. While hand-marked paper ballots offer a physical record that can be audited, electronic systems rely on complex software that is often shrouded in secrecy. This secrecy makes it difficult to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, increasing the risk of errors or malicious interference. The author cites instances where vulnerabilities have been discovered in proprietary voting machines, raising questions about the integrity of past elections.

    Open-source voting systems, on the other hand, provide a mechanism for continuous improvement and security enhancement through community review. With the code publicly available, security researchers, academics, and concerned citizens can scrutinize the system for flaws and suggest improvements. This collaborative approach can lead to more robust and secure systems than those developed in secrecy by private vendors.

    The article also addresses concerns about intellectual property rights, arguing that the public interest in secure and trustworthy elections outweighs the private interests of voting machine vendors. The author suggests that governments can fund the development of open-source voting systems, ensuring that the code remains in the public domain and accessible to all.

    Furthermore, the article emphasizes the importance of voter verification and voter-verifiable paper audit trails (VVPATs) in conjunction with open-source systems. VVPATs provide a physical record of each vote that can be compared to the electronic record, allowing for independent verification of election results. When combined with open-source software, VVPATs enhance transparency and accountability, making it more difficult to manipulate election outcomes.

    The author concludes by calling for a shift towards open-source voting systems as a necessary step to restore public trust in elections. By embracing transparency and community involvement, governments can create more secure, accurate, and trustworthy voting systems that are resistant to manipulation and reflect the will of the people. The article advocates for policies that promote open-source development, independent audits, and voter verification to ensure the integrity of future elections.
