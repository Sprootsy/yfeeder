<b>Summary:</b>
</p>
<p>
After being banned for a century, the Seine River in Paris has reopened to swimmers. This transformation is the culmination of a €1.4 billion project aimed at improving the river's water quality, enabling it to host swimming events during the 2024 Olympic Games and providing recreational swimming areas for the public. The project involved upgrading wastewater treatment plants, improving the sewer network to prevent untreated waste from flowing into the river during heavy rains, and reconnecting houseboats to the sewage system. Three swimming areas near iconic locations such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre have been created and are accessible free of charge.
</p>
<p>
The ban on swimming in the Seine was implemented in 1923 due to severe pollution caused by industrial discharge and untreated sewage. Despite numerous attempts to clean up the river over the decades, including efforts by former President Jacques Chirac, these initiatives were largely unsuccessful. The current project, initiated in 2016, is more comprehensive and has yielded tangible results, as evidenced by improved water quality tests.
</p>
<p>
The project faced significant engineering challenges, particularly in managing overflow from combined sewer systems during storms. A key component of the solution is a large underground reservoir designed to store excess rainwater and prevent it from carrying pollutants into the Seine.
</p>
<p>
The reopening of the Seine is not only a symbolic victory for Paris but also a practical one. Beyond the Olympics, it offers Parisians and tourists new recreational opportunities and transforms the river from a barrier into an asset for the city. The project's success has garnered international attention, with other cities facing similar water pollution challenges expressing interest in learning from Paris's experience.
</p>
<p>
While the water quality is now compliant with European standards, ongoing monitoring is crucial to ensure the river remains clean and safe for swimming. The authorities are committed to maintaining the progress made and further improving the Seine's ecosystem.
