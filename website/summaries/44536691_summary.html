<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The document is a preliminary report by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) of India regarding an accident involving a Cessna 172R aircraft, registered as VT-ANB, which occurred on May 9, 2024. The aircraft was operated by the Rajiv Gandhi Government Flying Training Institute (RGGFTI) and was undertaking a solo cross-country flight from Birsi Airport, Gondia to Baramati Airport and back. The flight was uneventful until the return leg.
</p>
<p>
The pilot, a trainee at RGGFTI, reported to the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) at Birsi Airport that he was experiencing low fuel and requested an immediate landing. During the approach, the engine stopped, and the aircraft crash-landed approximately 1.5 nautical miles (NM) short of the runway. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. The pilot sustained injuries but was able to exit the aircraft.
</p>
<p>
The report details the sequence of events leading up to the accident, including the pilot's flight planning, the weather conditions, and the communication with ATC. It notes that the pilot had declared "Mayday" due to the low fuel situation. The report also describes the damage to the aircraft, including the broken nose wheel strut, damage to both wings, and the bent propeller.
</p>
<p>
The AAIB's preliminary findings suggest that the engine stoppage was likely due to fuel exhaustion. The report mentions that the investigation is ongoing and will include a detailed examination of the aircraft's wreckage, the pilot's training records, and the operational procedures of RGGFTI. Further analysis will be conducted to determine the precise cause of the accident and to formulate safety recommendations to prevent similar occurrences in the future.
