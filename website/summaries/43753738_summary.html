        <p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The article discusses a campaign to subvert the African Internet Registry (AFRINIC), one of the five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) responsible for managing and distributing Internet number resources (IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses, and Autonomous System Numbers) in Africa. The article details allegations of mismanagement, corruption, and attempts to seize control of AFRINIC for personal and political gain.</p>
<p>According to the article, the troubles began when AFRINIC started enforcing its membership rules and attempting to reclaim unused or fraudulently obtained IP address blocks. This action reportedly angered certain members who had benefited from the previous lax enforcement, leading them to retaliate. The article alleges that these individuals and entities initiated a coordinated effort to destabilize AFRINIC's leadership and governance.</p>
<p>One central figure mentioned in the article is Lu Heng, who is described as having been involved in various controversies related to IP address allocations and AFRINIC's internal affairs. The article suggests that Lu Heng and his associates sought to gain influence over AFRINIC's board and management to further their own interests.</p>
<p>The article suggests that the campaign to subvert AFRINIC involved spreading misinformation, launching legal challenges, and manipulating internal processes. It alleges that the goal was to create chaos and undermine confidence in AFRINIC's ability to manage Internet resources effectively.</p>
<p>The author expresses concern that the actions of a few individuals could have serious consequences for the stability and security of the Internet in Africa. They warn that if the efforts to subvert AFRINIC succeed, it could lead to the mismanagement of vital Internet resources, hinder the growth of the digital economy, and undermine trust in the regional Internet governance.</p>
<p>The article advocates for greater transparency and accountability within AFRINIC and calls on the broader Internet community to support the organization in resisting these alleged attempts at subversion. It stresses the importance of protecting AFRINIC's independence and ensuring that it can continue to fulfill its mission of managing Internet resources for the benefit of the African continent.</p>
