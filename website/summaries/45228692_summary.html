     Matt Mullenweg's blog post, dated September 2025, celebrates a significant legal victory for Automattic, the company behind WordPress.com and other ventures. The post details a long-standing battle against a "patent troll" â€“ a company that acquires patents primarily to generate revenue through litigation rather than developing or using the patented technology. This particular entity, referred to only as "the troll," had been aggressively targeting bloggers and small businesses within the WordPress ecosystem, alleging patent infringement related to basic blogging functionalities.
