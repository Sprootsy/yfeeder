    <h2>App Lets ICE Track Vehicles and Owners Across the Country</h2>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The article discusses how U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is using a powerful data analytics tool called CLEAR (CLEAr Law Enforcement Automated Resources), developed by Thomson Reuters, to track vehicles and their owners across the United States. The tool provides ICE agents with access to vast amounts of personal information, including license plate recognition (LPR) data, vehicle registration details, driver's license information, addresses, phone numbers, and other sensitive data points. This information is aggregated from various public and private sources, giving ICE the ability to monitor vehicle movements, identify potential targets, and build profiles on individuals and their associates.</p>

<p>The concern raised in the article is the potential for misuse and abuse of this technology. Civil liberties advocates express worry about the lack of transparency and oversight regarding how ICE uses CLEAR and the implications for privacy and due process. The tool allows for mass surveillance, enabling the agency to track individuals without warrants or reasonable suspicion. The potential for errors in the data and the risk of misidentification further compound these concerns, potentially leading to wrongful stops, detentions, or other adverse actions against innocent individuals.</p>

<p>The article highlights specific features of CLEAR that are particularly concerning. The LPR data, for example, tracks vehicles' movements over time, creating a detailed log of their whereabouts. The ability to cross-reference this data with other information, such as driver's license details and address history, allows ICE to build comprehensive profiles on individuals and their networks. The article emphasizes that this level of surveillance can have a chilling effect on free speech and association, as people may be less likely to engage in activities or express opinions if they know they are being monitored.</p>

<p>Moreover, the article points out that the use of CLEAR raises questions about the legality of ICE's surveillance activities. While some data sources may be publicly available, the aggregation and analysis of this information through a tool like CLEAR create a different level of surveillance than what would be possible through traditional means. The lack of clear legal standards governing the use of such technology leaves room for interpretation and potential abuse.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the article raises serious concerns about ICE's use of CLEAR to track vehicles and individuals across the country. The tool's capabilities for mass surveillance, combined with the lack of transparency and oversight, create a significant risk to privacy, civil liberties, and due process. The article underscores the need for greater scrutiny of ICE's surveillance practices and the implementation of safeguards to protect individuals from potential abuses.</p>
