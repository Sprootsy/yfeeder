  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>
    The article "Building Burstables: CPU Slicing with Cgroups" on Ubicloud's blog discusses how to implement burstable CPU allocation using cgroups (control groups) in Linux. This approach allows containerized workloads to exceed their initially allocated CPU resources for short periods, improving performance for applications with variable CPU demands, while still guaranteeing a minimum level of resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article begins by explaining the problem of inefficient resource utilization in cloud environments.  Traditional fixed CPU allocation can lead to underutilization when workloads don't consistently require their maximum allocated resources.  Burstable CPU allocation addresses this by allowing containers to "burst" above their guaranteed CPU share when resources are available.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article then provides a detailed explanation of cgroups, a Linux kernel feature used to limit, account, and isolate resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O, etc.) of process groups.  Specifically, it focuses on the CPU subsystem of cgroups, which allows for controlling CPU allocation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The core concept revolves around using CPU shares to define the relative priority of different cgroups. A cgroup with a higher CPU share will receive a larger proportion of the available CPU time compared to a cgroup with a lower share. The author explains how to create cgroups, set CPU shares, and move processes into these cgroups using command-line tools like `cgcreate`, `cgset`, and `cgclassify`.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article then delves into implementing burstable behavior. The key idea is to set a relatively low CPU share for a cgroup, representing the guaranteed minimum CPU allocation. However, when the system has idle CPU resources, the cgroup can utilize more than its proportional share, effectively "bursting" above its guaranteed level. This is possible because the CPU scheduler will distribute unused CPU time among the cgroups that are actively requesting it, regardless of their configured shares, as long as there are no other cgroups contending for those resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article emphasizes that burstable CPU allocation doesn't guarantee sustained high CPU usage; it only allows for opportunistic utilization of available resources. If other cgroups start demanding CPU time, the burstable cgroup will be throttled back to its allocated share.
  </p>
  <p>
    The article provides practical examples of creating and configuring cgroups for burstable workloads, including commands for setting CPU shares and moving processes into the created cgroups. It also outlines how to monitor the CPU usage of cgroups to observe the bursting behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, the article concludes by highlighting the benefits of using burstable CPU allocation for improving resource utilization and application performance in cloud environments. It allows for more efficient use of CPU resources, leading to cost savings and improved responsiveness for applications with fluctuating workloads. However, it also acknowledges the importance of careful monitoring and configuration to ensure fair resource allocation and prevent resource starvation.
