<h2>Summary</h2>
The article discusses the implementation of burstable CPUs using cgroups (control groups) to provide a balance between guaranteed CPU resources and the ability to handle occasional spikes in demand. The author details the challenges and solutions involved in building a system where virtual machines (VMs) or containers can exceed their allocated CPU limits for short periods, improving overall performance and resource utilization.

The article starts by explaining the concept of CPU bursting, where a workload can temporarily consume more CPU than its base allocation, utilizing idle CPU cycles from other resources. This is particularly useful for applications that experience infrequent but resource-intensive tasks.

The author then delves into the technical aspects of using cgroups to achieve CPU bursting. Cgroups are a Linux kernel feature that allows for the isolation and management of system resources, including CPU, memory, and I/O. The article specifically focuses on the `cpu.cfs_quota_us` and `cpu.cfs_period_us` parameters within cgroups, which control the CPU time allocated to a group of processes.

The primary challenge is that standard cgroup configurations typically enforce strict CPU limits, preventing workloads from exceeding their quota, even when spare CPU capacity is available. The author explores different approaches to overcome this limitation.

One method discussed is dynamically adjusting the `cpu.cfs_quota_us` value based on system load and resource availability. This involves monitoring CPU utilization and increasing the quota when the system has spare capacity and decreasing it when resources become scarce. This dynamic adjustment requires careful consideration to avoid resource contention and ensure fairness among different workloads.

Another approach involves using a credit-based system. Each workload is assigned a certain amount of "CPU credits," which are consumed when the workload exceeds its base CPU allocation. The credits are replenished over time, allowing for occasional bursts of activity. This system requires careful calibration of credit consumption and replenishment rates to achieve the desired bursting behavior.

The article also addresses the importance of monitoring and observability. Accurate monitoring of CPU usage, cgroup parameters, and system load is crucial for effective CPU bursting. The author discusses the use of tools and techniques for collecting and analyzing this data.

Furthermore, the author highlights the need for robust error handling and resource management. The system must be able to gracefully handle situations where resources become overcommitted or when workloads attempt to consume excessive CPU time. This involves implementing mechanisms for throttling or limiting CPU usage, as well as providing alerts and notifications to administrators.

In conclusion, the article provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges and techniques involved in building a burstable CPU system using cgroups. It emphasizes the importance of dynamic resource allocation, credit-based systems, monitoring, and error handling for achieving optimal performance and resource utilization.
