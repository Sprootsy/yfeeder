  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The KDE community is developing a native virtual machine manager called Karton. This new application aims to provide a user-friendly and integrated experience for managing virtual machines within the KDE Plasma desktop environment. Karton is built using Kirigami and aims to make the process of creating, configuring, and running virtual machines more accessible to KDE users.</p>
  <p>Karton leverages the libvirt virtualization API, which allows it to support various hypervisors such as QEMU/KVM, Xen, and others, offering users flexibility in their choice of virtualization technology. The application focuses on providing a streamlined interface, making it easier for both novice and experienced users to manage their virtualized environments without needing to rely on external or less integrated solutions.</p>
  <p>The development team emphasizes ease of use, aiming to simplify common tasks like creating new virtual machines from ISO images, configuring network settings, and managing virtual hardware resources. By integrating directly into the KDE ecosystem, Karton promises a cohesive user experience, adhering to KDE's design principles and offering seamless integration with other KDE applications and tools.</p>
  <p>Currently under active development, Karton is expected to evolve with new features and improvements as it progresses towards its initial release. The KDE community welcomes contributions and feedback from users and developers to help shape the future of Karton and ensure it meets the needs of a wide range of users.</p>
