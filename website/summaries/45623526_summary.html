<p>Jeep Wrangler 4xe owners are experiencing issues after a recent over-the-air (OTA) software update bricked their vehicles. Owners report that after the update, their Wranglers are completely non-functional, unable to start or shift out of park. The exact cause of the problem is unknown, but it appears widespread, affecting a significant number of 4xe vehicles. The vehicles are rendered useless, leaving owners stranded.

Owners are frustrated with the lack of communication and the extended downtime, as they rely on their vehicles for daily transportation. Many owners are reporting this is happening during vacations.</p>
