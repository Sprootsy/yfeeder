<p>The article discusses the potential consequences of the Supreme Court case *Moore v. United States*, focusing on the Independent State Legislature (ISL) theory. This theory posits that state legislatures have nearly unchecked power to regulate federal elections, free from interference by state courts or constitutions. The article outlines the history of the case, which originated from a challenge to a provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that taxed unrealized gains of U.S. shareholders in foreign corporations. The plaintiffs, the Moores, argued this was an unconstitutional direct tax, but the case evolved to encompass the ISL theory due to concerns about its potential impact on election administration.</p>

<p>The article details the origins of the ISL theory, tracing it back to arguments made during the 2000 Bush v. Gore litigation, where some justices suggested state legislatures had primary authority over presidential elections. While the Supreme Court rejected the most extreme version of this argument then, the theory has resurfaced and gained traction in conservative legal circles.</p>

<p>The article presents several potential consequences if the Supreme Court endorses a strong version of the ISL theory. These include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Disrupting established election procedures by invalidating state court rulings interpreting state election laws.</li>
<li>Empowering state legislatures to gerrymander congressional districts without judicial review.</li>
<li>Creating uncertainty and confusion around election administration, potentially leading to challenges to election results.</li>
</ul>

<p>The article also mentions that the Supreme Court has considered the ISL theory in previous cases, like *Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission*, where the Court rejected the argument that only the state legislature could draw congressional districts. However, the current composition of the Court raises concerns that it might be more receptive to the ISL theory now.</p>

<p>The article emphasizes that *Moore v. United States* is not directly about elections, but the Court's decision could have profound implications for the future of American elections and the balance of power between state legislatures and other branches of state government.</p>
