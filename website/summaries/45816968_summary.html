<p><b>Summary:</b></p>
<p>According to TorrentFreak, Google removed 749 million URLs associated with Anna's Archive from its search results following copyright complaints. Anna's Archive is a search engine that indexes publicly available books and academic papers, and provides links to where these resources can be found. The takedown requests were primarily filed by major publishing industry groups such as the Copyright Clearance Center (CCC), Holtzbrinck, Elsevier, and others. These groups claimed that the indexed content infringed upon their copyrights. The sheer volume of takedowns indicates a significant effort by copyright holders to limit the discoverability of Anna's Archive content through Google's search engine. Anna's Archive argues that it operates as a search engine, similar to Google itself, and doesn't host the content directly. Instead, it provides links to content that is already available on the internet. Despite these arguments, the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) takedown requests have been successful in prompting Google to remove a large number of Anna's Archive URLs. This action has sparked debate about the balance between copyright enforcement and access to information, particularly in the realm of academic and educational resources. The removals affect the visibility of Anna's Archive in Google's search results, potentially making it more difficult for users to find the indexed materials. This move is part of a broader effort by copyright holders to combat online piracy and protect their intellectual property rights. Anna's Archive has implemented measures to counter the takedowns, but the sheer scale of the removals presents a significant challenge to the project's accessibility.</p>
