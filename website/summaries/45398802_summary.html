<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>According to a recent report, Apple's upcoming A19 chip is poised to become the fastest single-core CPU in the world based on Passmark benchmark scores. This achievement would mark a significant milestone, surpassing not only existing PC chips but also Apple's own M3 Ultra. The A19 is expected to debut in the iPhone 17. It appears that the A19 will achieve this level of performance while maintaining a passively cooled design, which is typically associated with lower power consumption. If these reports are accurate, the A19's single-core performance would represent a substantial leap forward for mobile processors, challenging the dominance of traditional desktop CPUs in this area. The details surrounding the architecture and specific clock speeds of the A19 remain undisclosed, but the implications of such performance are significant for the mobile computing landscape.</p>
