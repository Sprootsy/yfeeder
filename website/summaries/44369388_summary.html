  <p>This article on Cotton Geeks, dated June 24, 2025, discusses improvements to Python packaging, specifically focusing on the UV package installer and PEP 723. The author recounts their experiences experimenting with these tools.</p>

<p>UV is described as a very fast Python package installer and resolver written in Rust. It's portrayed as being significantly quicker than `pip`, `venv`, and other established tools. The author highlights the improved speed for tasks like creating virtual environments and installing dependencies. The article showcases how UV simplifies the process of setting up Python projects by rapidly managing dependencies.</p>

<p>PEP 723, described as embedding project metadata in `.py` files, aims to simplify project configuration and reduce the need for separate configuration files like `pyproject.toml`. This PEP allows developers to define project dependencies and other metadata directly within the main Python file, making project setup more streamlined, especially for smaller projects or single-file scripts. The article explains that PEP 723 facilitates easier project distribution and collaboration by consolidating essential project information in one place.</p>

<p>The author shares examples and usage scenarios, demonstrating the practical benefits of using UV and PEP 723 together. The author's experimentation showcases how UV and PEP 723 can improve developer workflows by increasing efficiency and simplifying the management of Python projects. The article promotes the adoption of these new tools and standards within the Python community to foster innovation and productivity.</p>
