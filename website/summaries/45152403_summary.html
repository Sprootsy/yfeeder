<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The ProPublica article "How Often Do Health Insurers Deny Patients' Claims?" investigates the frequency with which health insurance companies deny claims for medical care. The article uses data collected from the federal government to analyze denial rates across different insurers and types of plans. It reveals significant variations in denial rates among insurers, with some companies denying a much larger percentage of claims than others. The investigation also explores the reasons behind these denials, including issues such as lack of prior authorization, coding errors, and disputes over medical necessity. Additionally, the article examines the appeals process available to patients who have been denied coverage and highlights the challenges patients face in successfully appealing these denials. The investigation suggests that many patients do not appeal denied claims, potentially leaving billions of dollars in medical expenses unpaid. The article raises concerns about the transparency and fairness of the claims denial process and its impact on patients' access to healthcare.</p>
