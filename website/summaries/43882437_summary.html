<h2>Summary</h2>

This article provides a comprehensive overview of Numerical Linear Algebra (NLA) from the perspective of Computer Science and Information Engineering. It emphasizes the importance of NLA in various computational tasks and modern data analysis.

The article starts by establishing the fundamental role of linear algebra in representing and manipulating data through vectors and matrices. It highlights the significance of efficient numerical algorithms for solving linear algebra problems, especially with the increasing scale of data. It underlines that NLA provides essential tools and techniques for developing robust and scalable computational methods.

The article covers several key topics within NLA. It discusses direct methods for solving linear systems, such as Gaussian elimination and LU decomposition, along with their computational complexity and stability considerations. It then delves into iterative methods, which are particularly useful for large and sparse systems, including methods like Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and Conjugate Gradient.

Furthermore, the article addresses eigenvalue problems, which are central to many applications like dimensionality reduction and graph analysis. It covers methods for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors, such as the power method, QR algorithm, and methods based on Krylov subspaces.

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is also discussed, a fundamental matrix decomposition with applications ranging from data compression to recommendation systems. The article touches on methods for computing the SVD and its properties.

The article emphasizes the importance of understanding error analysis and stability in NLA. It discusses concepts like floating-point arithmetic, condition number, and backward error analysis, which are crucial for developing reliable numerical algorithms.

Finally, it also briefly touches upon topics like least squares problems and optimization techniques.
