The article provides step-by-step instructions on how to activate, configure, and use WiFi Motion.</p>

<p>The article also outlines important considerations, including limitations such as potential false alarms due to environmental factors or pets, and the feature's dependence on a stable WiFi connection. Optimal performance is achieved when the xFi Gateway is centrally located and elevated.  Furthermore, it mentions that WiFi Motion is not a substitute for a professional security system and should be used as a complementary tool for home awareness.</p>

<p>Troubleshooting tips are provided for common issues, such as frequent false alerts. These suggestions include adjusting the motion sensitivity settings and ensuring the environment is free of factors that may cause signal interference. The article emphasizes that the effectiveness of WiFi Motion can vary depending on the home's layout, building materials, and other factors that can impact WiFi signal propagation.</p>
