  <p>Waymo is dedicated to enhancing road safety for Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs), which include pedestrians, cyclists, scooter riders, and others who are not protected by an enclosed vehicle. The company emphasizes that VRUs are disproportionately affected by traffic incidents, accounting for a significant percentage of fatalities and serious injuries. Waymo believes that autonomous driving technology has the potential to significantly reduce these incidents by addressing human errors that frequently cause collisions.</p>
  <p>Waymo's approach to VRU safety involves several key strategies. First, the Waymo Driver, their autonomous driving system, is designed with advanced perception capabilities. It uses a suite of sensors, including cameras, lidar, and radar, to create a detailed and comprehensive understanding of the surrounding environment. This enables the Waymo Driver to detect VRUs, predict their movements, and respond proactively to avoid collisions, even in challenging conditions such as low light or inclement weather.</p>
  <p>Second, Waymo focuses on predicting VRU behavior. Understanding how a pedestrian or cyclist is likely to move is crucial for safe navigation. The Waymo Driver is trained on vast amounts of real-world data to anticipate various VRU actions, such as pedestrians crossing the street unexpectedly or cyclists changing lanes. By accurately predicting these behaviors, the Waymo Driver can make more informed decisions and avoid potentially dangerous situations.</p>
  <p>Third, Waymo is committed to defensive driving strategies. The Waymo Driver is programmed to prioritize safety, even if it means yielding to VRUs in situations where a human driver might not. This defensive approach includes maintaining a safe following distance, slowing down in areas with high VRU activity, and being prepared to stop quickly if necessary.</p>
  <p>Fourth, Waymo emphasizes continuous learning and improvement. The Waymo Driver is constantly learning from its experiences on the road, refining its perception and prediction models to enhance its safety performance. This iterative process involves analyzing data from millions of miles of autonomous driving, identifying areas for improvement, and implementing software updates to enhance the Waymo Driver's capabilities.</p>
  <p>Waymo is also actively engaged in research and collaboration to advance VRU safety. The company works with academic institutions, government agencies, and other stakeholders to share its knowledge and insights, contribute to the development of industry standards, and promote policies that support the safe deployment of autonomous driving technology.</p>
  <p>In summary, Waymo's multi-faceted approach to VRU safety, combining advanced technology, predictive modeling, defensive driving strategies, and continuous learning, aims to significantly reduce the risk of collisions involving vulnerable road users and create safer streets for everyone.</p>
