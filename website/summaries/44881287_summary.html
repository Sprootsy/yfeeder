<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The article "Let Me Know" by Deane Barker discusses the importance of providing clear and direct communication channels for website users to offer feedback. The author argues that many websites make it difficult for users to report issues, ask questions, or otherwise engage with the website owners. This lack of accessibility to feedback mechanisms can lead to missed opportunities for improvement and user frustration.

Barker contends that website owners often prioritize polished presentation and marketing over functional communication. This can manifest as burying contact information deep within the site, using generic and impersonal contact forms, or relying solely on social media for feedback. The author suggests that these approaches are inadequate and can leave users feeling ignored or undervalued.

The article emphasizes the value of direct feedback in identifying bugs, usability problems, and areas for content improvement. Barker argues that users are often willing to report issues if given a simple and convenient way to do so. By actively soliciting and responding to user feedback, website owners can gain valuable insights that can lead to a better user experience and improved website performance.

Barker proposes that websites should prominently display a clear and direct way for users to "let them know" about any issues or feedback. This could be a simple contact form, an email address, or even a direct messaging system. The key is to make it easy for users to reach out and to ensure that their feedback is acknowledged and addressed in a timely manner. By prioritizing communication and actively listening to their users, website owners can build stronger relationships and create more successful online experiences.
