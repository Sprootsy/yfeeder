  <h3>Summary:</h3>
  <p>
   The preprint article "Quantifying the impact of temperature and humidity on dengue transmission in Singapore" investigates the relationship between weather variables (temperature and humidity) and dengue transmission in Singapore. The study aims to quantify how changes in temperature and humidity affect dengue transmission dynamics, which is crucial for predicting and managing dengue outbreaks, especially in the context of climate change.
  </p>
  <p>
   The researchers used weekly dengue case data from Singapore spanning several years, along with corresponding temperature and humidity data. They employed statistical models, specifically time series regression models, to analyze the correlation between dengue incidence and the weather variables. The models accounted for potential confounding factors and time lags between weather conditions and subsequent dengue cases.

   The analysis revealed a significant positive association between temperature and dengue transmission. Higher temperatures were found to be associated with increased dengue incidence, likely due to the accelerated development and reproduction rates of both the <em>Aedes</em> mosquito vector and the dengue virus itself within the mosquito. Humidity also showed a complex relationship with dengue transmission; while higher humidity generally favors mosquito survival, extremely high humidity levels can sometimes be detrimental.

  <p>
   The study provides quantitative estimates of the impact of temperature and humidity on dengue transmission in Singapore. These findings can be incorporated into predictive models to forecast dengue outbreaks based on weather patterns. This allows public health officials to implement targeted interventions, such as increased mosquito control measures, in anticipation of periods with higher dengue risk. The research also emphasizes the importance of considering climate change projections in long-term dengue prevention strategies. As global temperatures rise, understanding the impact of temperature on dengue transmission becomes increasingly critical for protecting public health.
