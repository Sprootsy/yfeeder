<p>Google is introducing new features to Google Wallet focused on age and identity verification to provide a more seamless and secure experience for users. These features are designed to work across various use cases, including proving age to purchase age-restricted items or verifying identity for specific services. The goal is to minimize the need for physical IDs and offer privacy-preserving methods for verification.</p>

<p>One key aspect is the ability to store a mobile driver's license or state ID securely on a user's device. This allows users to present verified credentials to businesses or other individuals who need to confirm their age or identity. Google emphasizes that users have control over the information they share, only providing the necessary details for the specific verification purpose, such as confirming they are over a certain age without revealing their exact date of birth. This helps to reduce the risk of oversharing personal information.</p>

<p>The system uses encryption and security measures to protect the user's data. Google states that the mobile ID is securely stored on the device and is not shared without explicit user consent. When verification is required, a process is initiated where the requesting party sends a request, and the user can then review and approve the sharing of only the required information.</p>

<p>Google is working with businesses and organizations to integrate these verification methods into their systems. This includes partnerships with retailers, bars, and other establishments that require age verification for purchases. The aim is to create a standardized and widely accepted digital verification process that reduces friction and improves efficiency for both users and businesses.</p>

<p>In addition to age verification for purchases, Google Wallet's identity verification features can be used for other applications such as online account recovery or proving identity to access certain services. This expands the utility of the digital ID beyond just age-restricted purchases.</p>

<p>Overall, Google Wallet's new age and identity verification features aim to provide a secure, convenient, and privacy-preserving way for users to prove their age or identity in various situations, reducing reliance on physical documents and streamlining verification processes.</p>
