<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The website "50centadjustedforinflation.com" is a humorous and simple single-serving site dedicated to calculating the inflation-adjusted value of 50 Cent's name from the year 2000 (when he signed his first record deal) to the present year (2024). It presents a basic inflation calculation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data to show what amount of money in 2024 would have the same buying power as 50 cents in 2000.</p>
<p>The site's primary purpose is to apply a comedic lens to the rapper 50 Cent's stage name by demonstrating how inflation erodes the real value of currency over time. The site is very straightforward. It displays the current year, states that the value of 50 cents in 2000 has been adjusted for inflation, and provides the equivalent value in today's currency. It also includes a brief explanation of the calculation method and a disclaimer about potential rounding errors.</p>
