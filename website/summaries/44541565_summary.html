   <h3>Summary</h3>
   <p>
     The article is a blog post detailing the author's experience in writing a C compiler. It's a personal account of the project, outlining the different stages, challenges, and insights gained throughout the process. The author emphasizes that the journey, while demanding, was highly educational and rewarding. The compiler targets a custom virtual machine (VM) architecture.
   </p>
   <p>
     The author starts by explaining the initial motivation for the project, driven by a desire to deeply understand how compilers work. They then describe the high-level architecture of the compiler, which includes components like a lexer, parser, semantic analyzer, intermediate code generator, and a code generator that targets the custom VM. The initial stages involved setting up the basic infrastructure, including the lexer and parser, using tools like Flex and Bison (or similar).
   </p>
   <p>
     A significant portion of the article is dedicated to discussing the challenges encountered in each stage. For example, the author describes the complexities of handling the full C grammar, particularly issues related to parsing precedence and associativity of operators. Semantic analysis, which involves type checking and ensuring that the code adheres to C's rules, is also highlighted as a particularly difficult part of the project.
   </p>
   <p>
     The intermediate code generation phase is described as a crucial step, where the abstract syntax tree (AST) generated by the parser is transformed into a lower-level representation that is easier to translate into machine code. The author discusses the choices made in designing the intermediate representation and how it facilitated the subsequent code generation phase. The article also covers the challenges of implementing various C language features, such as pointers, structures, and function calls, and how these features impacted the design of the compiler and the VM.
   </p>
   <p>
     The final stage, code generation, involved translating the intermediate code into instructions for the custom VM. The author discusses the design of the VM, its instruction set, and the considerations involved in mapping C language constructs to VM instructions. Optimization techniques, while not the primary focus, are also mentioned as potential areas for future improvement. The blog post shares insights into debugging and testing the compiler.
   </p>
   <p>
     Throughout the article, the author emphasizes the importance of breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks, and the value of continuous testing and debugging. They also reflect on the knowledge gained about compiler design, C language intricacies, and the inner workings of computer systems. The author states that the project gave them a much deeper appreciation for the complexity involved in creating the tools that programmers use every day.
