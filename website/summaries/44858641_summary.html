  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The article, titled "I Tried Coding With AI. I Became Lazy and Stupid," details the author's experience of using AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to assist with coding tasks. Initially excited about the prospect of increased efficiency and reduced mental strain, the author quickly found that relying heavily on AI led to a decline in their problem-solving skills and overall understanding of code. The author describes how the ease of generating code snippets and solutions with AI made them less inclined to think critically about the underlying logic and algorithms. Instead of actively engaging with the code and understanding its functionality, they became overly reliant on the AI's suggestions, often accepting them without fully comprehending their implications. This passive approach, the author argues, resulted in a diminished capacity to debug effectively and to adapt code to specific needs. The author also notes a decreased motivation to learn new programming concepts and techniques, as the AI could often provide ready-made solutions without requiring them to expand their knowledge base. Furthermore, the article touches on the potential for AI to introduce errors or inefficiencies into code, which can be difficult to detect when one is not thoroughly engaged in the development process. The author concludes that while AI tools can be valuable aids for experienced programmers, excessive dependence on them can hinder the development of essential coding skills and ultimately make one a less capable and adaptable developer. The experience served as a cautionary tale, highlighting the importance of maintaining a balance between leveraging AI assistance and actively engaging with the core principles of programming. The author emphasizes the need for programmers to remain active learners and critical thinkers, even as AI tools become increasingly sophisticated and prevalent.</p>
