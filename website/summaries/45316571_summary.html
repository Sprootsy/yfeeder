<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
According to an Automotive News article from September 19, 2019, automakers and suppliers were concerned about the potential impact of tariffs under the Trump administration. Specifically, the article discusses a letter from the Motor &amp; Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA) to the Trump administration expressing concerns about potential tariffs on auto parts imported from Europe and other countries. The letter warns that these tariffs could raise costs for both manufacturers and consumers, harm the competitiveness of the U.S. automotive industry, and potentially lead to job losses. The article highlights the auto industry's reliance on global supply chains and the potential for tariffs to disrupt these chains, ultimately increasing vehicle prices and reducing sales. It also notes the ongoing trade negotiations and the industry's efforts to advocate for policies that support free and fair trade.
