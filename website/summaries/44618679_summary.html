<div>
<p>The Infrastructure Report Card, published by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), provides a comprehensive assessment of the current state of America's infrastructure. It evaluates various infrastructure categories, assigning letter grades based on their condition and performance. The report aims to raise awareness about the critical need for infrastructure investment and modernization.</p>

<p>The report card assesses infrastructure across several key areas, including aviation, bridges, dams, drinking water, energy, hazardous waste, inland waterways, levees, parks and recreation, ports, rail, roads, schools, solid waste, stormwater, transit, and wastewater. Each category is evaluated based on factors such as capacity, condition, funding, future need, operation and maintenance, public safety, resilience, and innovation.</p>

<p>The grades assigned reflect the overall health and functionality of each infrastructure category. A grade of "A" indicates excellent condition, while a grade of "D" signifies that the infrastructure is in poor to fair condition and mostly below standard, with a significant risk of failure. A grade of "F" means the infrastructure is in critical condition and requires urgent attention.</p>

<p>The report highlights the economic consequences of inadequate infrastructure. It points out that failing infrastructure can lead to disruptions in transportation, commerce, and daily life, resulting in increased costs for businesses and consumers. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of infrastructure investment for economic growth, job creation, and improved quality of life.</p>

<p>The ASCE advocates for increased investment in infrastructure at all levels of government â€“ federal, state, and local. It recommends a range of solutions, including raising the gas tax, investing in water infrastructure, modernizing the electric grid, and streamlining the permitting process for infrastructure projects. The report also stresses the importance of adopting innovative technologies and sustainable practices to improve the efficiency and resilience of infrastructure systems.</p>

<p>The Infrastructure Report Card serves as a call to action for policymakers, industry leaders, and the public to prioritize infrastructure investment and modernization. By highlighting the challenges and opportunities facing America's infrastructure, the report aims to stimulate informed discussions and drive meaningful change.</p>
