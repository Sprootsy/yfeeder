        <h1>The last masters of Afro-Colombian machete fencing</h1>
        <p>
<div>
<p>The article discusses the Afro-Colombian tradition of machete fencing, known as &quot;esgrima de machete,&quot; which is practiced primarily in the Chocó region of Colombia. This martial art and cultural expression is facing the threat of extinction due to various factors including the armed conflict in the region, the disinterest of younger generations, and the lack of institutional support. The tradition is more than just a fighting style; it's deeply intertwined with the history, identity, and social fabric of Afro-Colombian communities, serving as a means of conflict resolution, a form of recreation, and a way to pass down ancestral knowledge.</p>

<p>The article highlights the efforts of the last remaining masters (&quot;maestros&quot;) to preserve and promote this tradition. They are actively working to transmit their knowledge to younger people through workshops, demonstrations, and cultural events, hoping to reignite interest and ensure the survival of machete fencing. The story emphasizes the urgency of their mission, as these masters represent a living link to a rich cultural heritage that is on the verge of disappearing. The lack of resources and support from the government and other institutions further complicates their efforts, leaving the responsibility of safeguarding this tradition largely on the shoulders of these dedicated individuals and their communities.</p>

<p>The article explores the cultural significance of the machete within these communities, noting that it's not merely a tool for agriculture or combat, but a symbol of resilience, resistance, and identity. The machete fencing tradition embodies the values and beliefs of Afro-Colombian culture, reflecting their history of struggle and their determination to preserve their heritage in the face of adversity. The story paints a picture of a vibrant yet vulnerable cultural practice, highlighting the importance of cultural preservation and the need for greater recognition and support for Afro-Colombian traditions.</p>
