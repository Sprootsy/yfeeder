    <h2>EPA Moves to Roll Back Drinking Water Standards</h2>
    <div>
<div>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed strict new regulations for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water. These regulations target six specific PFAS, setting legally enforceable maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for five individual PFAS: PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFHxS, and HFPO-DA (also known as GenX Chemicals). For PFOA and PFOS, the EPA proposes an MCL of 4 parts per trillion (ppt), which is near the lowest level that can be reliably detected. The EPA will also use a Hazard Index MCL for mixtures containing PFNA, PFHxS, and HFPO-DA. Water systems will be required to monitor for these PFAS, inform the public of any violations, and reduce PFAS levels if they exceed the MCLs. The EPA estimates that implementing these regulations will cost billions of dollars annually but will provide significant health benefits, preventing thousands of illnesses and deaths. The agency anticipates that most public water systems can meet these standards, particularly with the aid of federal funding available through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The proposed regulations are subject to public comment and will be finalized after considering this feedback. The EPA's move is a major step toward addressing the widespread contamination of drinking water with PFAS, which have been linked to various health problems, including cancer, liver damage, and immune deficiencies. The agency highlights the importance of providing all Americans with access to clean and safe drinking water, free from the health risks associated with PFAS.</p>
