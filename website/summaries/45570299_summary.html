  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <p>The article from April 13, 2021, discusses a significant liquidation event in the cryptocurrency market, described as the largest ever at the time, resulting in $9 billion being wiped out. The sudden downturn impacted various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, which experienced notable price drops. The event was attributed to a combination of factors, including over-leveraged positions and cascading liquidations, where initial price drops triggered further sell-offs as exchanges automatically closed positions to prevent losses. This created a snowball effect, exacerbating the market decline. The scale of the liquidation raised concerns about market stability and the risks associated with high leverage in cryptocurrency trading.</p>
